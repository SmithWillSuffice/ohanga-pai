# Ōhanga Pai

Ōhanga Pai means "good economics" or "well-being" in [Te Reo Māori](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=ohanga).

## Developer Respository for Ōhanga Pai

On the github page you will eventually be able to find some software for exploring macroeconomics. 
I have not uploaded it yet since it's still in early alpha development.

## Background to Ōhanga Pai

The terminology I use is:

* **MMT** = Modern Monetary Framework (it's a descriptive lens upon macroeconomics, but with aspects of theory, hence the "T").
* **Spiritual Economics** = this does not mean anything mystical, when I use the word "spiritual" I *always* means abstract virtues: kindness, honesty, compassion, wisdom, love, justice. 

To the extent those spiritual attributes re platonic ideals, then yes, they're metaphysical (they'd be spiritual realities in any conceivable universe). 
But in out physical universe they all take on concrete forms. 
So you do *not* have to be a hippie or new age-er (and best *not  to be so, imho) to grok MMT and Spiritual Economics.

Spiritual Economics only *begins* with MMT, because we desire to begin with honesty --- with an accurate framework for analysis. 
Spiritual Economics ends when we arrive at a political economy in theory that also exists in practice, which guarantees economic justice is made materially real. 
This is an impossible end goal, pretty much, but pragmatically it is always possible to move society ever closer towards the ideal, and such movement is our real practical goal.

As the blog will discuss, MMT borrows heavily from what is correct in Quesnay and the Physiocrats, Ricard, Smith, Marx, Keynes, Kalecki, Sraffa, Minsky and the other non-orthodox post-Keynesians. 
MMT rejects most of the ideology of Neoclassicals, Austrian School and new Keynsians schools, not because they are poor frameworks for mathematical analysis, but because their assumptions are unrealistic, sometimes downright false. 
(Although some aspects of those mainstream schools are *also* poor mathematics, which the blog will also discuss).

## Adding content

If you want to contribute to the repository, ask me (Bijou Smith) for access. 
You'll need to establish personal trust first (or hack my account LOL, either way I do not mind).

## Usage

The software will be in separate modules, so will have specific usage documentation.

## Support

To hep push this project forward please consider donating cash. No crypto accepted (a ponzi scam, all of it).

## Roadmap

Just a few initial topics of interest here at Ōhanga Pai:

* Asset exchange models (Drăgulescu--Ispolatov--Yakovenko models) 
* Keen--Goodwin models in python (pymsky project)
* Job Guarantee models in the Keen--Goodwin framework.
* Econometric analysis of the central bank interest rate policy --- are interest rate hikes inflationary in the short run? (Interest--income and forward pricing channels overwhelm the propensity to save/borrow discriminants). 
* Website on MMT and Spiritual Economics questions and related discussions


## Contributing

You might consider:

1. Using Minsky to validate some of the work on Ōhanga Pai.
2. Ask more questions to interrogate MMT.
3. Furthering some of the philosophical developments on the spiritual side.

## Authors and acknowledgment
We (Dr Bijou Smith and the Ōhanga Pai team) are forever in debt to Warren Mosler and Bill Mitchell University for getting the MMT ball rolling back in the mid 1990's. 
Radndall Wray and Stephanie Kelton for popularising and extending the academic literature on MMT. And Steve Gumbine and team at Real Progressives, Christian Reilly and Patricia Pino from The MMT Podcast for grass roots activism promoting MMT, and all the followers on social media.
