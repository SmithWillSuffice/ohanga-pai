<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bid9grX8Wk" target=_blank>BadFaith podcast (here)</a>
talking about Argentinian fascism, which masquerades as libertarianism, but
is in fact merely neoliberalism. People get all these things confused.</p><p>Neoliberalism enables fascism, but is not overt fascism (worship of the nation
as sacred, usually with policies when in power enforced by ramped-up police.)
Neoliberalism requires a police state and &ldquo;security sate&rdquo; for sustenance, but
is not overt fascism, and often has fairly liberal doctrines such as gay
rights, cosmopolitanism, and DEI policy.</p><p>Why does neoliberalism enable fascism? I should say &ldquo;breeds fascism&rdquo; &mdash; it
is because austerity economics always breed discontents who are happy to see
an authoritarian remove the austerity. (Usually utterly false hopes since
fascists do not grok MMT either.) In fact, such malcontents are justified in
their discontent, but too often they settle for the disgusting complacency
and low expectations of merely wanting to hear the authoritarian <em>say</em> they
will remove austerity.</p><h2 id=bens-dummy-neoclassicism><a class=anchor href=#bens-dummy-neoclassicism title='Anchor for: Ben&rsquo;s Dummy Neoclassicism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Ben&rsquo;s Dummy Neoclassicism</h2><p>I will not stoop to calling Ben Norton a neoliberal, because that&rsquo;d be dumb
and counterproductive, but he does still use a lot of neooclassical economics
framing in his supposedly progressive leftist stances. He constantly employs the
&ldquo;tax payer dollars&rdquo; myth. Oh our hard earned tax-dollars going to fund this
war here or there. It&rsquo;s laughable. Those are government issue dollars, they
can be used to pay taxes, but they are not the dollars of the tax-payer that
are funding the wars.</p><p>Such &ldquo;tax payer funded&rdquo; mythology feeds the fascists and is right-wing
talking point fodder. It is disgraceful.</p><p>I suspect Norton borrows (like a neoliberal with currency) his own thoughts
on MMT from Michael Hudson. The trouble is Hudson does not fully grok MMT
either. Hudson talks in terms of realpolitik, so he has the framing where
people do <em>think and believe</em> tax-payer dollars are funding the government.
This is true, people do think that, and it drives neoliberal policy.</p><p>But you, we, everyone who is honest, need to start talking about what
is <em>possible</em> and what the true available policy space open to a government
is, free from ideology. Because only )then_ can we learn how no tax revenue
is needed for free healthcare and affordable green state housing, and free
education, and whatnot. The constraints are available real resources, not
currency, not inflation.</p><p>Do not listen to Stephanie Kelton (but vote for her for POTUS if she runs).
She will talk about the &ldquo;inflation constraint&rdquo; which is again false
psychology, it is not pure MMT. An MMT understanding tells you the source of
the price level, and thus also how to keep it stable. Inflation is not an
economic concern for an MMT analysts, the real resources not being produced
are the <em>only</em> purely macroeconomic concern. Inflation is a political false
psychology concern, and so a <em>real concern</em> in today&rsquo;s political climate, for
sure (gets you voted out of office if you do not loosely control the price
level). But we have to start talking about options beyond such false
psychology in order to make progress.</p><p>I left these comments for BadFaith comments readers, LOL. First after Ben
tried to explain why Argentina has hyper-inflation, starting with the lie that
the USD is the &ldquo;global reserve currency&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the thesis of Hudson&rsquo;s
<em>Superimperialism</em>, but it is not because of Bretton-Woods, which died long
ago, it is because of false psychology. Bretton-Woods died${}^\dagger$, but the
psychology of fixed exchange rate mentality did not.</p><p>(${}^\dagger$Although it can still be found&mldr; in New Hampshire.)</p><p>No foreigner needs US dollars. That&rsquo;s the reality, but they <em>want</em> US
dollars. Not just to avoid forex fee costs LOL, but because of false
psychology.</p><p>y comment:</p><blockquote><p>@13:00 rubbish. (1) USD is not a global reserve currency, but from false
psychology ppl still think it is, so have insatiable demand for it (for
little good reason, there are higher interest rates around). (2) when a
currency is pegged (to anything else, gold or another currency) you must
promise to deliver that which you peg to as redemption, rather than just
redemption for tax liabilities. Without strong exports you cannot deliver
on this promise, so to maintain the peg you need to borrow in huge amounts,
and promise higher and higher interest rates to keep the bond buyers happy.
This is directly inflationary. Neoliberals think high interest rates are
disinflationary, but as usual they&rsquo;ve got the money story totally backwards.
Central Bank rates hikes are one-to-one pro-inflationary if the ratio of
propensities of savers to borrow and borrowers to save is about 1, which
it typically is &mdash; higher CB rates just raise the forward prices and the
own price, directly, not even a secondary market effect. Read up on MMT
from Mosler & Mitchell, not Kelton.<br>   i) <a href=https://media.realvision.com/wp/20220309173133/A-Framework-for-the-Analysis-of-the-Price-Level-and-Inflation.pdf target=_blank>https://media.realvision.com/wp/20220309173133/A-Framework-for-the-Analysis-of-the-Price-Level-and-Inflation.pdf</a><br>   ii) <a href=https://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-General-Analytical-Framework.pdf target=_blank>https://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-General-Analytical-Framework.pdf</a></p></blockquote><p>Ben Norton is good on anti-fascism and geopolitics, but on macroeconomics he
sucks &mdash; almost like a neoliberal &mdash; &ldquo;our hard earned tax dollars!&rdquo; LOL.</p><h3 id=wrong-on-trade-again><a class=anchor href=#wrong-on-trade-again title='Anchor for: Wrong on Trade&mldr; again.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Wrong on Trade&mldr; again</h3><p>Ben mentions the Argentinian &ldquo;trade deficit&rdquo;. They are getting more than
they give.</p><p>My comment:</p><blockquote><p>@13:00 trade deficits are a good thing Ben. Economics is the opposite of
religion: it is better to receive than to give. The issue is they peg to the
USD, so they have an export led growth model, the stupid model. Put the peso
on a float, then you can have as many imports as foreigners are willing to
sell. Exports are a real cost, not a real benefit, they are the price you pay
for imports. The USA does not enjoy a trade deficit because of &ldquo;global
reserve currency status&rdquo;. Little young New Zealand also enjoys a trade
deficit, not that our neoliberal infested government recognizes this as a
win for us &ndash; they are constantly trying to make us export more to foreigners,
when we have people domestically who are living on the street and could use
those kiwifruit and pine lumber goods.</p></blockquote><h2 id=other-comments-on-liberal-versus-libertarian><a class=anchor href=#other-comments-on-liberal-versus-libertarian title='Anchor for: Other comments on Liberal versus Libertarian.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Other comments on Liberal versus Libertarian</h2><h3 id=someone-in-the-comments-section><a class=anchor href=#someone-in-the-comments-section title='Anchor for: Someone in the comments section.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Someone in the comments section</h3><p>There was a comment:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bad Faith interview with Denis Kucinich was really good.

libertarians notwithstanding. They have to choose between their policy
options, because libertarianism is inconsistent with a government monopoly
on the currency and law. But they can never do without a quasi-police state
to enforce their policies. They inevitably choose the fashy elements that
are anti-liberal because they prefer the (fake) &ldquo;free market&rdquo; aka. sell to
the highest bidders (which is pro-inflationary, so&mldr; LOL)</p></blockquote><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../70_space_nuts>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../70_space_nuts>Space Nuts</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
