<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juV794znnI" target=_blank>commentary by a retired UK Ambassador, Craig Murray here</a>
.
The usual good stuff was said from a
peace activist perspective, but tainted with all the usual pessimism and doom.
I always find Pascal to be a good counterbalance to the nihilists, but he tends
to say things straight-up, so is not wildly optimistic nor idealistic either.
You could say Lottaz is a bit of a soul mate.

the Internet, a few thoughts about world government. While these are my own
opinions, they did not spring from the vacuum. I can credit Shoghi Effendi and
the Baháʼí &rsquo;s for most of the inspiration. They are tragically little known, but
if you want some serious spiritual political economy then you&rsquo;d be doing
yourself a favour reading some of Shoghi Effendi&rsquo;s writings. They are probably
a bit heavy going for materialists, since the entire basis of Baháʼí philosophy
is to show spiritual virtues through action, not just in words. And the basis
for most Baháʼí thought is the harmonic duality between our physical life
and our spiritual life. In short, everything exists for a spiritual purpose,
and the physical world is a testing ground, a place for spiritual growth.</p><p>What is <em>spiritual purpose</em> though? The simple but not too simple answer is
that the purpose is for the soul to grow in spiritual capacity, and all that
means is to become more honest, more kind, more compassionate, more just,
more loving, more forgiving, more trustworthy, more humble in the face of
one&rsquo;s fallibility, and all the rest. More knowledgeable is good too, but more
wise is even better.</p><p>You could also call this <em>the meaning of life</em>. It is not a bad definition.
If purpose is meaning, and meaning is purpose, I think it is a good definition.</p><p>And yes, social construction is a thing: how you go about the meaning and
purpose of life will depend upon your context, your culture, your family,
your learning. The Baháʼí concept celebrates such sociology, while
acknowledging there are still spiritual universals that are platonic in
some sense. Trustworthiness is a foundation for a civil society in any
civilization. Even non-sentient to the extent &ldquo;trust&rdquo; can be so defined.</p><p>((I can define &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in a non-sentient system: it means obeying the laws
of physics. All of non-sentient nature we know is trustworthy with respect
to quantum mechanics, but not with respect to classical mechanics &mdash; context!))</p><p>Those who do not believe in the platonic type of reality of spiritual
verities, or who think these concepts are merely socially constructed, are
going to find it hard to get through even a few pages of
Shoghi Effendi, but I think the vast majority of people on Earth would find
his work illuminating.</p><p>Having noted all that, I would say the writings of Shoghi Effendi are not
really meant for public consumption. They presume a familiarity with the
Baháʼí Faith, and if you lack that understanding then I think you&rsquo;d be missing
too much. As something of a bridge, I hope to build a little bit of a
scaffold from popular progressive and liberal-social democracy ideals to
these principles of world government articulated by Shoghi Effendi.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t like the look of the bridge feel free not to cross it.</p><h2 id=a-brief-comment-agreeing-with-lottaz><a class=anchor href=#a-brief-comment-agreeing-with-lottaz title='Anchor for: A Brief Comment agreeing with Lottaz.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Brief Comment agreeing with Lottaz</h2><p>In an old school <em>nice twitter</em> style i posted a comment below Pascal&rsquo;s
video clip, I tried to best summarize in as few words as possible, the bare
minimum basis for a world government.</p><blockquote><p>This is such an important issue. An international governing body has to be
legitimized by the mass of ordinary people, and not become just another layer
of the wealthy elites control. In this context, <em><em>beware</em></em> of the right-wingers
and libertarians who scream about &ldquo;the globalists&rdquo; and incite fear of a world
government. They are the types who love an authoritarian control (namely
themselves) over their own land and resources, but cry like babies when a
large section of society desires a democracy. The point to having a world
government is precisely as Pascal describes, it would have a clear limited
demarcated purpose in enforcing <em><em>agreed upon</em></em> an evolving fit-for-purpose
set of international laws, and would not <em>(should not)</em> in any reasonable
sense erode individual nation sovereignty. In other words, it can never be,
should never be <em>allowed</em> to be, a neoliberal/neocon institution, since that
would entirely defeat the purpose and give just cause to the right-wingers
and libertarians who fear a world government.</p></blockquote><p>This leaves a lot unsaid. Short of a long essay, what can I add to round off
the commentary?</p><h2 id=prerequisites-exist><a class=anchor href=#prerequisites-exist title='Anchor for: Prerequisites Exist.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Prerequisites Exist</h2><p>One principle is that world leaders and the &ldquo;body politic&rdquo; in general might
sometimes be successful in pushing through policy before the groundwork has
been laid. Thus hard prerequisites for political implementation rarely exist.
But there are a lot of soft prerequisites.</p><p>One of these occurs in the Palestinian&ndash;Israeli conflict. I will only mention
here the policy choice between a One State solution and a Two State solution.
My father was something of an expert on Middle East politics towards the end
of his life, having moved in top level circles in Israel as a diplomat for
an NGO (the Baháʼí World Community). He changed his view over time to a One
State solution, citing the immense problems of settler colonialism and Zionism,
which cannot just be swept away by authoritarian dictate. He preferred to
see democracy. A homeland for the Jewish people in perpetuity for sure, but
shared with all other people of the land.</p><p>We are not so unaccustomed to this in New Zealand. We are proud to be
multicultural, but we are also fiercely bicultural. The Māori people will
always have a special place in New Zealand politics. This is in part a
realization of irreversible changes in world civilization. Cultures will not
be lost anymore, you cannot destroy a significant culture these days no
matter how hard you try, there are two many archivists (to put it crudely!).</p><p>However, what I prefer to say in current times is that for Palestine&ndash;Israel
there is no $n$-state solution for any $n$ until the people of the land are
prepared to live together in peace and harmony.</p><p>If the people of the Middle East are prepared to live together in peace and
harmony then there is an $n$-state solution for any $n>0$. The decision on
what $n$ is suitable becomes a democratic choice, after sufficient debate
and deliberation. If the Israeli&rsquo;s are prepared to clear real estate they
have settled in, say, the post-1967 map, then perhaps an $n=2$ state is
possible in harmony. If not, then an $n=1$ state would be the choice, imposed
by the Israelis precisely because they are unwilling to abandon the real estate.
But then the entire world had better impose upon Israel a true democracy for
the people living in the land.</p><p>Here is another prerequisite: how can you possible think of the entire world
imposing democracy upon an Israel&ndash;Palestine One State? You cannot, the
United Nations has not earned that legitimacy, and will not be trusted while the
Security Council veto power is in place. The entire UN has to first become a
true international democracy of nations. One nation, one vote.</p><p>For that same reason &mdash; since per capita this would look like a skewed
democracy, which it would be &mdash; the powers of the UN have to be strictly
limited. The UN can never be allowed to infringe on the domestic sovereignty
of any one nation. This is the price the UN must pay for
<em>one country, one vote</em>. The UN will never be able to resolve all conflict.</p><p>However, the UN can always be granted wide ranging diplomatic power. The UN
diplomats would be protected, and violations of such protection would have to
have severe repercussions, such as the right of all the other nations to rise
up against any nation violating the UN charter. This should not be
controversial.</p><p>In violating the (hypothetical future) UN charter a nation is choosing,
deliberately, knowingly, to cede their sovereignty in the manner prescribed
by the charter. (Since it is not yet written, I cannot say exactly to what
degree, but I would imagine the ordinary citizens of the nation would in no
way be oppressed by the UN.)</p><p>Who is holding up peace in the Middle East? &mdash; The United Nations is, and
many others, but the <em>immaturity</em> of the UN (not the existence of the UN) is,
in my estimation, the biggest obstacle. All M.E. peace efforts in the past
have been, as Lottaz put it, basically &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; (not of the good kind). He
means disorganized and lacking cohesion as well as infested and corrupted by
powerful vested interests in militarism and unipolar hegemony and the like&mldr;
so yeah, basically anarchy of the right-wing anarcho-capitalism
variety &mdash; who has the most power has all the say.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../57_yanis_in_a_harness>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../57_yanis_in_a_harness>Yanis in a Harness</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
