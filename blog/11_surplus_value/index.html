that emerges in a society, was measured using the state&rsquo;s unit of account (dollars,
pounds, marks, yuan, yen, pesos, &c.)</p><p>So when some economist talks about theories of surplus value they often reduce to
nominal terms (the state currency unit) not real terms (energy and material).
But this is fine. As long as you know when it is appropriate to translate between real
and nominal terms</p><h2 id=philosophizing-with-a-hammer-and-sickle><a class=anchor href=#philosophizing-with-a-hammer-and-sickle title='Anchor for: Philosophizing with a Hammer and Sickle.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Philosophizing with a Hammer and Sickle</h2><p>If I was really desperate to goof off, and was bored of physics or philosophy of
consciousness, I might try one time picking up Jonas Ceika&rsquo;s book &ldquo;How to Philosophize
with a Hammer and Sickle&rdquo; because it&rsquo;d like to get a postmodernists perspective on
Marx and Nietzche.</p><p>Nietzche fascinates me a little bit because he was a crap philosopher, but highly
esteemed, and highly despised. You know you&rsquo;ve done at least one thing right when you
create enemies on all sides. But what exactly did Nietzche get right that pissed off
so many and led to high esteem in the eyes of others?</p><p>To put a blunt point on it, I&rsquo;d say it was introducing (or rather emphasising) the
study of raw unapologetic power into social philosophy.</p><p>OK. Good job. Vital. No wonder postmodernists eat it up &mdash; postmodernism largely
eschewed Marx and turned to titillating each other with academic conferences about
power relations. This is critical theory, and a large block of postmodernism.</p><p>But this is not the topic to hand.</p><p>I mention Ceika because I decided to take the lazy man&rsquo;s way today and while looking
for the pixie sleepy dust I turned on a channel
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/@AWorldtoWin target=_blank>@AWorldToWin</a>
hosted by Melody, which had a
review of Ceika&rsquo;s book. The review runs into the &ldquo;younger Marx&rdquo; (idealist) and the &ldquo;older
Marx&rdquo; (political economist). That provoked a comment, so I wrote one, and will repeat
here with embellishments.</p><p>Although, truth be told, instead of counting sheep I was at first listening to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmMJbwE8j98" target=_blank>1Dime</a>
who does terrific MMT explainer videos, and he had
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pax-zns-RnI&list=PLyytc2-LIrN76QbCkj4Y6w65OAgpyIuRg" target=_blank>interviewed Melody</a>
.</p><p>((While doing acknowledgments here, I got a lot out of Steve Keen&rsquo;s writings on
Marx and the bogus labour theory of value.))</p><h2 id=labour-theory-of-value-is-false-by-a-long-way><a class=anchor href=#labour-theory-of-value-is-false-by-a-long-way title='Anchor for: Labour Theory of Value is False (by a long way).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Labour Theory of Value is False (by a long way)</h2><p>Melody points out a critique of Marx by Louis Althusser (1918-1990) an old white dude
philosopher, who pointed out this &ldquo;epistemic break&rdquo; in Karl Marx from the younger
(Hegelian) to the older (materialist).</p><p>I found this fascinating, because from reading Marx and following a few scholars who
understand the economics content in both the
<a href=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ target=_blank>Grundrisse</a>
and
<a href=https://libcom.org/article/capital-karl-marx target=_blank>Capital</a>
, I was able to, thanks to
Althusser (via Melody) pull out a splinter in my mind that had bugged me.</p><p>This is the little puzzle of why in the Grudrisse Marx figured out the source of
surplus value in production, knew it was not all labour, but then reversed to
deliberately falsify himself in Capital.
He tried to find human labour as the sole source of surplus value in Capital,
but failed in the Grundrisse. He found a weaselly way to twist his logic to argue for
the Labour Theory of Value (LTV) in Capital, and presented it.</p><p>I mean, I understood his motive: you tell the noble lie.
He wanted to scientifically (which means unscientifically in this context) &ldquo;prove&rdquo;
capitalism was self-destructive.</p><p>Why? Because he wanted to &ldquo;scientifically&rdquo; motivate fervour for socialism.</p><p>But noble lies like this are still lies, and can lead to no good (in my humble
opinion, not based on stupid petty moralisms, but empirically, and spiritually &mdash; in
spiritual terms, one big lie, even if noble, discloses a tainted heart).
Not that I condemn Marx, I do not know the guy. Marx had good reason to want to
suppress his emotions about the horrors going on in his Dickensian times. He&rsquo;d be
inhuman not to be touched by the plight of the poor and working class in general. But
instead of appealing correctly to spiritual impulses, as the younger idealistic Karl
might have done, he (perhaps?) thought he&rsquo;d grown up and so had to use &ldquo;science&rdquo;
&mdash; like an 18th Century but socialist Ben Shapiro (try to forget I wrote that,
I couldn&rsquo;t resist).
So, yeah. Who the hell am I to condemn a noble lie.</p><p>But me, today, I could never take a time machine go back and witness industrial
worker horrors and defile science to motivate socialist revolution, no matter how
much I&rsquo;d want a revolution. My approach is that truth matters, and is more powerful
than the noble lie.</p><p>Now, of course, I cannot say Marx was guilty of falsification. He wrote both volumes,
so must have been aware of the problem. I think he just tried to suppress his logic
and present a near-enough good argument for LTV. But in logic &ldquo;near enough&rdquo; has no
meaning (&ldquo;near&rdquo; is a topological concept, and &ldquo;enough&rdquo; is subjective), and in fact
Marx got it wrong in Capital. As any scientist today would tell you.</p><p>The physical inputs into production are energy, machinery, and skilled labour. (you
might count others, but these are the big three). Marx can argue that machinery was
always built using past labour. So the LTV holds good so far. But not all energy (and
mass) is created by the hands of humans. And not by several orders of magnitudes (as
inputs
into production). So the LTV is ridiculously false.</p><p>But in Marx&rsquo;s day, no economists understood what energy was. None of them understood
thermodynamics or basic physics. So you could, perhaps, forgive them this error?</p><p>In fact to this very day, several strains of sockcuckery economics (the bullsh*tters
&mdash; the Neoclassicals, Austrians and New Keynesians, even some post-Keynesians)
totally ignore the role of energy in production. Energy does not factor into their
models except as just one more commodity market like any other. They &ldquo;give-away&rdquo;
that they do not understand is if you ask them about constraints at the macroeconomic level. If they dare say &ldquo;run out of other people&rsquo;s money&rdquo; you know they&rsquo;re scientifically illiterate. The contraints are real resources, and maximally that&rsquo;s available free mass-energy (&ldquo;free&rdquo; here in the thermodynamicists sense, not the financial sense, free energy = <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergy target=_blank>exergy</a>
).</p><p>((Yet the French Physiocrats, not the nicest guys, did understand the role of energy in production. A pity they were not humanistically inclined. It could have aided the socialist cause had they been talking with Marx and Engels.))</p><h3 id=crystallized-labour><a class=anchor href=#crystallized-labour title='Anchor for: Crystallized Labour.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Crystallized Labour</h3><p>People have attempted to refute Steve Keen&rsquo;s analysis of the contradiction or switch
that went on from the Grundrisse to Capital, but none I know of have anything good to
say about it, and nor should they feel the need. You should not descend into
mysticism by claiming: <span style=color:#add8e6>&ldquo;It is the crystallized labor${}^\dagger$ contained in a commodity that provides it
with its objective value.</span>&rdquo; which
<a href=https://mmaluff.com/2012/11/02/in-defense-of-the-labor-theory-of-value/ target=_blank>one critic</a>
of
Keen&rsquo;s did.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because there is a far simpler case that Marx was morally correct for all
damn time, and his correctness had nothing to do with the LTV, and everything to do
with the ideals of justice.</p><p><span style=color:#add8e6>${}^\dagger$</span> You should be asking what
exactly do pseudo-materialist marxists mean by &lsquo;congealed" or &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; labour?
If they give you an account absent the role of energy you know they are either
self-deluded (so the religious type of marxist) or fibbing. They sure as heck are not
honest materialists. But being materialists is perhaps the root of their problem. In
this they share more in common with neoliberals than with myself. They need to
fabricate the pseudo-scientific argument in Capital because they do not permit
themselves the spiritual. I find that awfully tragic.</p><p>The comment I eventually left on the youtube clip was:</p><blockquote><p>another trouble with the &ldquo;older Marx&rdquo; was he was anti-scientific but thought he was
scientific. He showed why LTV is false in the Grundrisse, but then in Capital tried
to weasel his way out of it to be able to derive the FLP. Total failure. You know a
logically illiterate marxist zealot by whether they still believe the LTV and FRP.
The &ldquo;younger Marx&rdquo; had it all right - labour is not the sole source of surplus value,
but <em>that does not matter</em> because <em>labour is the <strong>only socially exploited</strong> source of
surplus value</em>. So capitalism (qua Marx) is morally and ethically plain wrong,
completely regardless of what the source of surplus value in production happens to be
(it&rsquo;s the Sun and soil, air and sea, for the most part, we get that &ldquo;for free&rdquo;
without social exploitation, until the rentiers arrive on the scene).</p></blockquote><p>Couldn&rsquo;t get too much more succinct.</p><p>I guess I could have written it not to take such a pot shot at marxist zealots. But to
my mind this sort of criticism matters.</p><h2 id=bosonized-revolutions><a class=anchor href=#bosonized-revolutions title='Anchor for: Bosonized Revolutions.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Bosonized Revolutions</h2><p>Any wannabe revolutionary today had better understand power relations (the one thing
Nietzche hit a decent nerve with, even if for warped reasons and messed up directions).
There economics thinking is stuck back in the ignorant past with gold standard
&ldquo;commodity currency&rdquo; thinking, or at best updated to New Keynesians fixed exchange rate
brainworm mentality.</p><p>In fundamental physics the force carriers are the bosons (characterized by not
obeying Pauli exclusion). What are they in political revolutions? Could it be
whatever underlies and buttresses solidarity?</p><p>Nietzche got power relations upside-down though. He rejected spirituality and
religion, but these are historically, and today, the single most powerful forces in
society. You know this because when they are abused they become anti-religions and
anti-spiritual (christian fanaticism, New Age grifts, cult worship, Hindu and
Buddhist separatism, Islamic militancy, &c., all are anti-religions) and yet retain
residual powerful force (for
harm). To combat this harm the greater power is spiritual &mdash; honesty, kindness,
compassion, love, truth and wisdom &mdash; these are always more powerful than guns
and swords. Castro knew this. He did not establish peace in Cuba at the point of
a spear, he defended his people with the guns, he did not tame them with guns.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that you need to grok MMT to be a better revolutionary (but it would not
hurt) but that you need spiritual weapons to fight the modern class war. Material
weapons will not overthrow neoliberalism. There is no falling rate of profit. There
is no direct force of historical materialism inevitably leading to the
collapse of neoliberalism.</p><p>If you want to defeat neoliberals, you will be either waiting for massive catastrophe
like climate or ecological damages, accompanied by violence from the green fascists,
<em><em>or</em></em> you&rsquo;ll be teaching people who are honest and decent and humble that
neoliberalism is evil and cannot be tolerated, and we have no need to wait for nature
to tell us this is so. We all have agency. We only lack solidarity.</p><p><a href=./>Next post (TBD)</a><br><a href=../10_proof_of_x>Previous post (Proof of X)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
