The &ldquo;true detectives&rdquo;, Rust and Marty, were very flawed people, but were driven by an
unshakeable desire to see justice done &mdash; admittedly only on the &ldquo;catch the bad guy&rdquo;
side it has to be said, not the &ldquo;raise up the poor&rdquo; side, but whatever. Griping entertainment with cinematic risk
(<a href=https://www.filmstories.co.uk/news/martin-scorsese-on-why-content-will-never-be-cinema/ target=_blank>à la Scorsese</a>
).</p><p>This post I&rsquo;m going to have a crack at writing about similar risk in politics.</p><h2 id=what-is-true-populism><a class=anchor href=#what-is-true-populism title='Anchor for: What is True Populism?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What is True Populism?</h2><p>You ought to read <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWKsTzHwIsM" target=_blank>Thomas Frank</a>
if
you&rsquo;re asking this question, but here&rsquo;s the short version.</p><p>True populism arose basically in Kansas in the 1890&rsquo;s. It was a working class
movement, cross-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-class (but rooted in the working class
&mdash; upper crust people with a conscience, or &ldquo;class traitors&rdquo;, made up some of
the composition). It rapidly spread across rural and small town USA.</p><p>Their cause was broadly speaking economic justice. The farmers
wanted a fair deal, the workers wanted fair wages, not to be ripped off and exploited
because they needed to work for wages just to eat.</p><p>No right-winger has ever been a true populist. Demonizing &ldquo;the populist left&rdquo; as
like the conservative reactionary fake populists (Nixon, Buchanan, Trump, DeSantis,
et al), is a terrible thing, and something Frank rightly rails bitterly against.</p><p>However, a lot of the grass roots support for these right-wing fake-populists comes
from what would have been the Kansas roots &mdash; the farmers, the blue collar workers,
the genuine intellectuals who had real knowledge in action, not book-knowledge
&ldquo;Das Kapital&rdquo; idiocy. Real knowledge &mdash; <em>what it is like <strong>to be</strong> desperately poor</em>.</p><p>By the way, old Karl Marx <em>had</em> such knowledge. Academic leftist pseudo-marxists do
not. A lot of that type of marxist-socialist (the mere book-read nerd type) rightly
abandoned Leninism (too violent), but then unrightly turned traitor and adopted
neoconservatism or centrist neoliberalism (basically anti-communism, but not for
good reasons). Neoliberalism is no less violent than Stalinism or Leninism, just a
different form of violence.</p><p>However, even some pseudo-Marxists who did not jump ship to neoliberalism have still
not understood populism. However, I won&rsquo;t say old K.M. himself would&rsquo;ve or would not
have embraced populism, I don&rsquo;t know what he would&rsquo;ve thought. It is however always
a slimy cop-out to label something &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; and reject it via the label
connotations (although, this is a legitimate tactic as regards MacDonalds
fast-food, just apply the label &ldquo;MacDonalds&rdquo; and Boom!, you have an instant
rejection by a bolshy food-snob like myself).
Marxism itself is bourgois, justsayin'.</p><p>However, you can find Idiot Nerds writing against populism${}^\ast$ from the
Marxist Ivory Tower
<a href=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext28/Populism.html target=_blank>say here</a>
:</p><blockquote><p>Says this marxist nerd: &ldquo;Those of us who would change the world must first unlearn
the dogmas of capitalism and construct new ways of thinking. Only when these ideas
become sufficiently widespread (whether in the working class or a group defined on
some other basis) can a challenge be mounted which could really threaten the dominant
structures of the present society. Only then can we begin to consider the possibility
of radical social transformation as an immediate political possibility.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those of us who would change the world&mldr;&rdquo; oh my gawd!</p><p>${}^\ast$I picked this article out because it was fair writing, it&rsquo;s not exactly
vigorously anti-populism, but it was too smug for my taste. Also, the author might
not be an academic, so the &ldquo;Ivory Tower&rdquo; jab is just me doing some rhetoric.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m all for &ldquo;raising class consciousness&rdquo;. But man, it&rsquo;s not
rocket science. Some of these academic marxists have no clue. They&rsquo;re almost
impediments to overthrowing neoliberalism (I know they do not mean to be, I don&rsquo;t
hate these writers).</p><p>You need a little humanity, some honesty, some humility, some balls, and a bit of a
load of sh*t dumped on you by a boss. That can be turned into a potent revolutionary
force brew. You don&rsquo;t need a whole new language or elite level comprehension my friends.
There are no dogmas of capitalism anyone needs to unlearn to know they&rsquo;re being abused.</p><p>I think the revolution will be over well and truly before that author gets around
to &ldquo;consider the possibility of radical social transformation.&rdquo; (Sounds like a
plagiarism from a friggin Pete Buttigieg line &mdash; or was it the Starbucks CEO campaign, Howie $chmultz.)</p><p>This is one thing about populism, it can run over a population like a steam-roller,
without killing anyone. We know it from history. More recently we saw fake-populism
from the right-wing almost mimic true populism in spreading like a cancer. What we
need is the steam-roller. Not the plague.</p><p>Also, what the hell is &ldquo;sufficiently widespread&rdquo;? You do not know what that is
until after the fact. But there&rsquo;s no point pissing around waiting for class
consciousness to arise the way you say it should. It&rsquo;s not science. Scientific
materialism, or whatever the hell you think modern Marxism is based upon is a pile
of horseshyte. But by all means, try to mold something from it if you can, I&rsquo;m not
opposed to the effort.</p><p>A revolutionary force does not need an army of policy wonks. There are plenty
who&rsquo;ll crawl out of the woodwork once the hard yakka has been done. Some might even
be good MMT&rsquo;ers, so you won&rsquo;t all get f*ked over by more austerity in the name of
Neo-Marx.</p><h3 id=to-be-good-requires-populism><a class=anchor href=#to-be-good-requires-populism title='Anchor for: To Be Good Requires Populism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>To Be Good Requires Populism</h3><p>In political economy no pure ideology is going to take unless &ldquo;the people&rdquo; accept it.
You are illegitimate if you force people at gun-point to accept a political regime.
(Literal or figurative gun-point, either.)</p><p>&ldquo;Where is the gun of neoliberalism?&rdquo; you might ask. This is the thing, the
neoliberals have the most powerful gun imaginable, it is invisible. Figuratively
speaking. In cold hard visible Parliamentary and Congressional vote records you can
easily see the gun if you want to, it&rsquo;s the gun of artificial austerity &mdash; depriving
the workers of the means to fend for themselves in the class war by over-taxing them
and under-spending on public utilities.</p><p>There is no other macroeconomics lens that shows the horror of neoliberal austerity
more clearly than MMT. The horror is truly seen once it is realized how the
monetary system works. It is only then you realize austerity is a tragic waste of
human lives. It is a gun, not just by metaphor but by concrete material effect. You
might as well just be done with workers you resent by gasing them or executing them
in neolib firing squads.</p><p>Neoliberalism works much more smoothly than a Nazi. You do not have to have a
gas chamber or noose around the neck of a worker if you tax them and then starve them.</p><p>Pure ideologies have a natural pull towards totalising the economy.
&ldquo;Our way or the highway.&rdquo; Populism is against such totalization. It listens to the
voice of the people, and attempts to satisfy the many, while minimizing the costs
to the few.</p><p>Is &ldquo;listening to the voice of the people&rdquo; itself a pure ideology? Not in my view,
because that voice is highly heterogeneous. That voice contains contradictions,
so is not pure. But that is why it is good.</p><h3 id=to-be-good-requires-risk><a class=anchor href=#to-be-good-requires-risk title='Anchor for: To Be Good Requires Risk.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>To Be Good Requires Risk</h3><p>The once popular freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (or AOC) could have
been a good populist. She had the right idea when she said once that there was no point
to having a seat in Congress to fight injustice if she was not prepared to lose an
election for speaking truth to power (or the like).</p><p>It is never too late for redemption, I say.</p><p>What about newly elected Representative John Fetterman? He&rsquo;s not a true populist
yet because he still believes in the
<a href=https://www.thecrimson.com/column/a-time-for-new-ideas/article/2020/3/18/gilbert-myth-of-taxpayer-money/ target=_blank>“Tax-payer funded” myth</a>
.${}\dagger$
But he has potential to go that last yard. (It is tough for people elected out of
local government office into central government, since in local government they were
(still artificially mind you) operating in a regime that was financially constrained,
in central government they are not, but many politicians cannot flip that switch.)</p><p>${}\dagger$Incidentally New Zealand academic <a href=https://theconversation.com/government-funds-are-not-taxpayer-money-media-and-politicians-should-stop-confusing-the-two-153195 target=_blank>Jonathan Barrett</a>
managed to write about
the &ldquo;tax payer funded " myth too, but still used atrocious language framing. He wrote
as if the government has money &ldquo;funds&rdquo;. There is no such thing. The NZ Parliament
has votes in the chamber for spending appropriations (and a bunch of Select Committee
public hearings for the public to have their say before the votes). There is no fund
in the New Zealand government, except on a spreadsheet.</p><p>If you are going to call a spreadsheet entry <em>you control</em> a &ldquo;fund&rdquo; you are some
special type of sociopath. Legally the NZ government score-keeping is nothing like
the legal liability of a private charity, savings & loan, or other house that has a
fund in a bank account. Those bank accounts <em>are</em> funds, not because they are pots of
gold, but because legally the holders are entitled to redemption from the banker. The
government score-keeping is under no such liability. Only the NZ Crown has the legal
right to issue the NZD by fiat. Banks have no such right.</p><p>The NZ government neither has money nor does not have money. We have a pure MMT
system. It is a simple public monopoly and score-keeping system. It is good, popular
and fit for purpose, if only the politicians knew that purpose and held to it
(collectively they do not).</p><p>Rep. John Yarmuth (Kentucky) made the journey to MMT eventually, then retired. A pity.
But as a private citizen he now also has a chance to redeem for past misguided
allegiance to neoliberal centrism. I wonder what will become of him? It is never too
late for an established insider, now an outsider, to risk facing the guns of neoliberalism. Take a few on the chin or in the guts for the working class.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, call me out for volunteering someone else for the firing squad. But you
don&rsquo;t know me. I&rsquo;d take a gut full of bullets for all the workers of the world if
they could be free of their bosses and still productive and creating the goods for
each other. The perennial problem is utter obscurity, I can&rsquo;t seem to take any
bullets since no one is aiming at me. I&rsquo;m a true populist but don&rsquo;t have the holes
in my guts to prove it.</p><p><a href=../17_machinescandothework>Next post (Machines Can't Think to Work)</a><br><a href=../15_media_whores>Previous post (Media Whores)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
