the Leftist hair-on-fire types annoy me about as much as the blithering idiot
Neocons. Or perhaps it is just consuming too much of my news clippings
from social media commentators is catching too much anti-establishment
fluff in the old daily news fishing net.</p><p>Anyway, what you hear often from a steady stream of Anti-establishment types
(who range widely on the political spectrum from extreme left-wing to
libertarian right-wing) is that</p><blockquote><div style=text-align:center;padding:10px>"US Empire is about to collapse!"</div></blockquote><p>It is cringe stuff.</p><h2 id=big-whimpers><a class=anchor href=#big-whimpers title='Anchor for: Big Whimpers.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Big Whimpers</h2><p>Empires do not just go away like this popular conception (or, let&rsquo;s say,
the conception that I thought-was-popular-but-only-in-my-own-head-since-
I-do-not-pay-much-attention-to-what-most-people-understand-of-history-of-empire
— you know, <em>that</em> sort of garden variety uncomplicated conception).</p><p>But take the Soviet Union for example. The system of governance collapsed,
but the Russian State did not, it was split up, but hardly a
collapse of Russia. And what matters is the People. Not the system of
government. The same oligarchs held on to power in Russia who existed in
the former Soviet Union. Hardly a collapse of anything. But, ok, it was a
massive shock administratively.</p><p>I doubt anything similar will occur for the USA, but if there is a massive
re-organization of government in the USA, it will not vanquish the might of
the USA that has not already been diminished. It might even strengthen the
USA, who knows. The key will be to excise the unholy madness of the
Trumpistas. If they burn-out, the establishment might be back but perhaps
with humbler ambitions for the billionaires, and greater ambitions for
the working class? Well&mldr; one can dream.</p><p>(I did hear a whisper somewhere recently that some former Obamarites have
grown a conscience.)</p><p>But yes, I am already looking ahead of the Trump&ndash;MarsKing reign. I think it
will be clownish and the shortest monarchy in world history. Holding real
power will still be the oligarchs when the Mar-a-Lago bulldozer dust settles.</p><p>Also, I really could not care if the USA gets split up into several
sovereign states. That could be a very good thing&mldr; for some, horrid
for others. But the balance of the break-up effect is impossible to guess.
Or even if there will be a break. My feeling from working in the USA is
that the ordinary people of the USA have a strong enough cultural identity
and can remain a united power. They are not united under a vision of
themselves as a complete imperialist economic colonial 𖧥𖨚𖨚𖦙𖥕ꛚ𖠢s, but they
do share a national multicultural identity that is richer than
they might give themselves credit for collectively (because the cult
of the individual is also strong).</p><p>Most people in the USA do not want this status as international pariahs
and neo-imperialists. If the government of the USA listens to their people,
all should be fine.</p><p>That&rsquo;s enough Crystal Ball gazing. I suck at it.</p><p>Using the Timestone called a &ldquo;history book&rdquo; I was wandering back centuries
and reading that my dopey naïve thought that the big grand stories of
collapses of empires was a bit mythical, was largely true. While a
&ldquo;great leader&rdquo; is often a man mounted on
a house of cards, the people of the empire are more resilient than the
names at the top, and tend to always persist. How could they not? You
cannot exterminate or assassinate a culture.</p><p>Some dude said, was it T.S. Eliot? &ldquo;The world ends not in a bang, but
with a whimper.&rdquo;</p><p>Such seems to be the way great empires get rolled up. The time span in
the historical accounts seems compressed when you read it, but taking a
sober look at the dates involved the process tends to (for most empires
which fade) to be very slow. Not Soviet Union style at all.</p><p>It is remarkable the Russians did it twice in a century. If you consider the
Soviets to have been pretty Empirical. (Physics nerd puns are the worst.)
Although, I do not know much about the Tsarist regime, I think from
accounts I&rsquo;ve read about the Bolshevik revolution that the Tsar was
pretty darn weak in the end well before the revolution, so this had been
a slow decline too.</p><p>A good history work detailing rise and fall of empires, recommended by

Jeff Rich, is John Darwin&rsquo;s <em>After Tamerlane</em>. It confirms what I had
always thought was fishy. Although, to be honest I have little time or
pleasure to read history, so it is possible it was my false impression
of History as taught that was at fault? Perhaps all the scholars would
say, &ldquo;Yeah, empires never really collapse like that!&rdquo;</p><h2 id=history-buffs-buffing-up-the-metals><a class=anchor href=#history-buffs-buffing-up-the-metals title='Anchor for: History Buffs, Buffing up the metals.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>History Buffs, Buffing up the metals</h2><p>There are two things I want to comment upon now.</p><ol><li>The accounts of the historians get the money story wrong I believe. They
talk about &ldquo;fiscal crises&rdquo; but are not giving us the more accurate historical
account.</li><li>For the USA today a &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; or reform of US government will not
necessarily be a collapse through &ldquo;collapse of the US dollar&rdquo;.</li></ol><p>I am going to take the Safavid Persians and Indian Moguls as my study for
the first.</p><p>The orthodox history buff idea is that the rulers needed to collect
&ldquo;revenue&rdquo; &mdash; in order to get their own currency!</p><p>Complete bollocks. Why do the history buffs, who are <em>supposed</em> to be
excellent with words, not understand the meaning of the word <em>revenue</em>?</p><p>The far more realistic account of empire collapse or retreat is that they
get over-extended and run out of real resources to support the army (or
mercenaries or whoever). Sometimes the peasants revolt too, if they are
sending a high revenue burden back to the rulers.</p><p>But we know <em>that</em> revenue side of the sorry! The peasants cannot create
the currency, so when they are forced to return it they lose spending
power and social fabric and community cohesion is destroyed. This is
the cohesion and unity that truly maintains empire. The history books
often tell this story skewed. Afterall, we are not talking about just
continual barbarian hoards one after another. Most empires are peaceful-like.
(Hey, relative terms ok! &ldquo;Nasty brutish and short&rdquo; is peaceful
compared to &ldquo;Violent sadistic and over-in-a-flash&rdquo;.)</p><p>The extensions of empire are always after more real resources, the
minerals, the silk, the food, and sometimes&mldr; yes, sometimes also the gold
and silver (fine thing for decoratively equipping a non-fighting army with).</p><p>In demanding gold and silver the elites are undermining their empire.
They are making the peasant work in ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs. But, you know, it
can work for a while.</p><h2 id=safavid-monetary-system><a class=anchor href=#safavid-monetary-system title='Anchor for: Safavid Monetary System.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Safavid Monetary System</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s examine the Safavids then, who supposedly had a fiscal crisis or
two (reduction in those revenues). I will sprinkle in a few links for the
history buffs.</p><p>During the Safavid era in Persia, the primary state currency was the
ʿabbāsī, named after Shah ʿAbbās I (1581&ndash;1629. The ʿabbāsī was issued in
both
<a href="http://pierre-marteau.com/wiki/index.php?title=Persia%3AMoney" target=_blank>silver and gold tokens</a>
,
with silver being the more common form. Other
denominations included the šāhī, moḥammadī, and tūmān (as a
<a href=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abbasi target=_blank>unit of account</a>
).
Double entry book-keeping was around, and the
<a href=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/fiscal-system-iv-safavid-and-qajar-periods target=_blank>Safavid and Qaja administration</a>
was not far off what we do today.</p><p>It is fair to say that the Safavid currency was partially tax-driven, but
not exclusively so. Several factors contributed to the demand for the
ruler&rsquo;s currency. Let&rsquo;s run through them:</p><ol><li><strong>Tax collection:</strong> The Safavid state collected taxes in its official
currency, which created a consistent demand for it. Taxes were levied
on land, trade, and various economic activities, requiring subjects to
acquire the state&rsquo;s currency to meet their obligations. Lo! Basic MMT.</li><li><strong>Administrative payments:</strong> High Safavid officials were paid salaries
and entitlements, often through land grants (toyūl) and special tax
assessments, which were likely denominated in the state currency.</li><li><strong>Trade and commerce:</strong> The ʿabbāsī and other Safavid coins were used in
domestic and international trade, creating additional
<a href="http://pierre-marteau.com/wiki/index.php?title=Persia%3AMoney" target=_blank>demand beyond tax purposes</a>
. Lo! The non-government sector also desires to
save in the tax credits.</li><li><strong>Minting control:</strong> The Safavid rulers maintained control over
minting, farming out the mint to private persons who were obliged to
bring foreign money to the public mint, thus ensuring the circulation
of state currency.</li></ol><p>This is an MMT system if ever I saw one.</p><p>Periodic reforms, such as those implemented by Shah ʿAbbās I, aimed to
standardize the currency system and increase its use throughout the empire.</p><p>On point <strong>3</strong> it was clear
<a href="https://books.openedition.org/editionsmsh/11406?lang=en" target=_blank>protection of trade routes</a>
was the main problem, not the revenues.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that foreign currencies also circulated:
Rixdollars, Spanish ryals, and other foreign coins were accepted and
often converted to ʿabbāsīs. Lo and behold! A forex desk was in operation!
It might have been a floating exchange rate, in fact what else could it
have been? The Safavids did not sem to have proper fixed exchange rate
control from what I can tell. The MMT just keeps piling on.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahmasp_I target=_blank>Different regions</a>
within
the Safavid empire used various currencies, such
as the akçe in Shirvan and the tanka in Mazandaran, before monetary
unification efforts in the 1570s.</p><p><a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history-project-ap/xb41992e0ff5e0f09:unit-3-land-based-empires/xb41992e0ff5e0f09:3-1empires-expand/a/read-the-safavid-empire target=_blank>Towards the end of the Safavid period</a>
,
the state faced economic difficulties, including currency devaluation and
shortages of silver, which affected the stability and demand for the official
currency. Which is an indication even back then the &ldquo;economists&rdquo; did not
grasp the function of the state/empire currency authority.</p><p>Thus while tax collection was a significant driver of demand for the
Safavid currency, it was part of a broader economic system that
included trade, administrative payments, and sometimes backwards
monetary policies, all of which contributed to the currency&rsquo;s use
and circulation but also unnecessary &ldquo;fiscal crises&rdquo;.</p><p>The point is though, it was still MMT. The taxes drove the demand for
the currency. Devaluation was not a silver supply problem, it was a problem
of lack of understanding (probably all around, but certainly among the
elites) of the tax system. When a whole system effect get&rsquo;s mentally
locked-in, and everyone thinks the <em>silver</em> literally <em>is the money</em> then
bad things will result.</p><h2 id=the-moghuls><a class=anchor href=#the-moghuls title='Anchor for: The Moghuls.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Moghuls</h2><p>A similar story can be told under the reign of the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Mughal_Empire target=_blank>Great Ahkbar</a>
across India and what is now Pakistan.</p><p>However, it appears their
<a href=https://cards.algoreducation.com/en/content/hoRkFsV4/mughal-monetary-system target=_blank>goldbug mentality</a>
was more severe than the Safavids. They really did believe in metallic
purity of coinages. So it is no wonder they suffered (needless) fiscal
crises.</p><p>It was clearly an MMT system. Akbar replaced the previous tribute system
with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency. I doubt pure Tribute
systems (real goods given) ever function for any large disparate empire, the
scaling is all wrong. (But I do not know, it just <em>seems</em> impossible.)</p><p>The Moghals did attempt to manage the relationship between face value
and intrinsic value. For example, the ratio of dam (copper coin) to
rupee fluctuated over time, from 48:1 at the start of Akbar&rsquo;s reign to
38:1 in the 17th century, and eventually 16:1 by the 1660s. This suggests
an awareness of changing metal values and attempts to adjust accordingly.</p><p>But this is more like managing a commodity peg. They needed the metal
resources to manage the peg. It was madness. But obviously people of the
day did not realize. The peasant communities they conquered were probably
functioning more like pure communists(!) The records of account were all
in their heads. So when the coins came along from Ahkbar they were not wise
to the &ldquo;scam&rdquo; so-to-speak. Someone somewhere was digging up metals to put
into a numeraire to support false consciousness. Where these the first
ever truly ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs in history (apart from the courtesan stuff).</p><p>Once the metallic value exceeds the coin face value, there is inevitable
defacing et cetera. So the Moghul system cannot truly have been a
metal standard. The metal intrinsic value had to have been an impediment
to trade efficiency I would think, not a bonus. It means people think
they desire the metal in the coin, but if the face value is higher the
metal is irrelevant, and in fact a big waste and inefficiency. Indeed, it
is an inherent instability. Did he Moghuls perhaps not realize this?
Seems so.</p><p>It is interesting to note the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire target=_blank>Wikipedia article</a>
stating the misunderstanding openly and naked:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The base of the empire&rsquo;s collective wealth was agricultural taxes,
instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar. These taxes, which
amounted to well over half the output of a
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC" target=_blank>peasant cultivator</a>
,
were paid in the well-regulated silver currency, and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire#CITEREFAsherTalbot2006 target=_blank>caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets</a>
.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>History goldbuuffer dude! Where dd the merchants get the tokens from in
the first place? Out their Mint 𖧥𖨚𖨚𖨚𖨚?</p><p>Now, it is possible Ahkbar had some merchants mint the coins themselves,
but this is not clear, and I highly doubt it. The administration was known
in high repute for excellent standardization, which means the officials
likely closely controlled the minting. No one could get a reap of rupee
until the empire spent it.</p><p>It is tragic: you have an MMT system but do not know it. How much
historic tragedy are we talking about now? It is not just 20th century
Neoliberalism causing collapse and crisis and unemployment.</p><p>History records a &ldquo;fiscal crisis&rdquo;. But it was not the lack of tax revenue
that was the problem, that was a symptom. The problem was over-extending
empire, and the need to protect trade route, because overwhelming for the
real resources available.</p><p>When real supply is pressured, the revenues collapse. The tax revenue is
the <em>ex poste</em> accounting evidence of a strong productive economy, it is
not the funds for the Empire.
I suspect there are very few history books that state this explicitly,
which is a great shame. Although, like I wrote, I am not a history buff
so have not read widely enough to say for certain the buffs are still
buffering the fake knowledge of metals and money.</p><p>Also, to end this bit, because the rulers probably falsely believed the
metal was the money, they probably caused the fiscal crises, needlessly.
Or was it? I still would say the over-extended need for real resources, and
likely loss of control over corruption, is what devalues the currency and
if the Ruler/Authority does not issue more tokens to satisfy the rise
in nominal demand (i.e., fails to accommodate the inflation) then bad
things are bound to happen. All the more so if pegging to the metal
standard.</p><p>Lesson for history: you&rsquo;d better know what you are standardizing for!</p><p>If you are the Ruler you always accommodate the inflation. Meanwhile, get
the army to work shoring up supply which is the cause. Not plundering,
but building. You do not want real supply efforts to be digging around
for metals for a stamped coin.</p><p>We cannot ever underestimate the stupidity of Ruler Elites and their
material greed. Throughout history they are often their own undoing, and the
empires they inherit go out with mostly whimpers.</p><h2 id=usa-today><a class=anchor href=#usa-today title='Anchor for: USA Today.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>USA Today</h2><p>It is almost absurd to think the USA will collapse due to fiscal
ineptitude. But stranger things have happened. I&rsquo;ll not go back to
the Crystal Ball. Instead I am gong to wildly speculate by looking at
the crumbs on my keyboard &mdash; there are none to be seen, such not much
to divine.</p><p>I will just bookmark that already the collapse on
the fiscal side due to the MarsKing Reign of PayPal Phreaks is unlike
in anceint times. The US dollar system is robust but also far more
significant than ancient tax driven systems. So in the USA today the
collapse of sales is likely to be so fast and so severe the lunatics will
be thrown out probably by Trump himself once Mar-a-Lago &c., sales plummet,
or the CIA get involved.</p><p>The CIA is not exactly a Mont Pelerin institution, but I rather
feel most of their experts are neck deep in stupid goldbug monetarist
groupthink mud, but even they might dimly understand the gold at
Fort Knox is not the thing worth protecting but the payments system is
the thing for national security preservation. Preservation of the
rentiers, Wall Street, Venture Capitalists first and foremost, and
then all the rest.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../89_geopolitical_knowledge_gaps>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../89_geopolitical_knowledge_gaps>Geopolitical Knowledge Gaps</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
