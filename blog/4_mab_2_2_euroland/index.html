The euro is an MMT system, but very
weirdly structured so as to look and function like a private or endogenous currency
system. But that is one of the veils of money.</p><p>It is easy to make a state currency system (MMT) look like a private currency.</p><p>Just listen to all the lunatics who claim the US FED is a private bank!
They obviously all believe the US dollar is created by the FED and not by Congress.
They are complete nutters.
But it is easy to forgive them, because Congress also acts like the FED is a hands-off
private entity. So it is a little unfair to blame the nutters for their warped views.
Those in power controlling the USA MMT system share a lot of those warped views.</p><p>((What is weird here is that in the USA at least, some of the EU, the nutters also
tend to hate government, and yet are following the government narrative. However,
this weirdness can be explained: those same nutters are often the ones getting
elected into government. Yeah. People who hate government are running governments.
And why not? From their perspective, the best way to destroy something truly well is often from the inside. This is why we gotta stop electing them.))</p><p>If enough people playing a baseball game think it is cricket, what you will observe is
a cricket game played with catching mitts and awkwardly rounded bats.
You see the duality? What does not change are the field, the mitts, the ball,
and the bats, but what is weird is how people use that equipment, the result is a
terrible game of cricket, or a worse game of baseball. (One of those is analogous to
the USA, the other to the EU, perhaps? I am not sure which is more appropriate a
mapping.)</p><p>But how is Mehrling any different to the nutters?</p><p>I think Mehrling understands the basics of MMT, but if you do, then I think the moral
obligation is to talk about the true account of currency monopoly first, which means
the state theory of money has to go first, because it is primary. Pedagogically order
matters.</p><p><strong>Aside:</strong> You can tell bad teachers from the good ones by the order in which they teach topics. I&rsquo;ve had this in physics. The best way to teach quantum mechanics is
to tell the truth first, before the mathematical formalism, which is that:</p><blockquote><p><em>We have no clue what the ontological basis for quantum mechanics is, so everything
to follow is pure descriptive formalism.</em> The wavefunction is not ontology. So don&rsquo;t try to construct an ontology based on the properties of the wavefunction.</p></blockquote><p>((An even better physics teacher might add: although we do not think the wavefunction
is ontology, it could be ontology. The point is we do not know, so do not second guess
nature. It is ok to conjecture an ontology then test it.))</p><p>However, the ECB certainly does function a lot like a private currency endogenous
money system, but that is only because that is the way the governments seem to wish
it to be. And here by &ldquo;the governments&rdquo; we really mean those in power. And those in
power in Europe are wannabe oligarchs, so yeah, they are highly prone to abusing the
state currency system and treating it like a private currency system. This is a major
source of the mess in euroland.</p><h2 id=hierarchy-of-money><a class=anchor href=#hierarchy-of-money title='Anchor for: Hierarchy of Money.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="../../img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Hierarchy of Money</h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/XB2DFuAP8SY?list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&t=51" target=_blank>Here is the relvant bit from the lecture</a>
.
On this I commented:</p><p>All well and good to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; the ECB as a &ldquo;bankers bank&rdquo; if indeed that is what it
is, but it is not, it is a creation of the EU, so is a creation of government(s) the
problem being that is a plural, so only the more powerful members of the EU (Germany,
France, Belgium) really have what is akin to monopoly currency issuing capacity.
Contrast with the USA where Congress has all the monopoly, since they can fire the
FED Board with a vote. The nuance that should be put up-front is that these
governments are <em>de facto</em> owned by the bankers and oligarchs, through distortion of
democracy. So legalistically Mehrling is wrong to claim the central banks are
private institutions, but functionally he is kind of right, but only because the
demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively <em>want</em> to be beholden to
private oligarch interests (most neolib politicians aspire to be members of the
oligarchy).</p><p>OK.</p><p>But the fact the monetary system gets abused in several ways makes Mehrling&rsquo;s point
about the hierarchy of financial instruments a reality, and a seriously big f-ing
problem.</p><p>For social stability we need <em>like things</em> and production equivalences to remain rough
equivalences, as in trade parity principles. The predatory financial speculators and
merchants of financial ponzi schemes, tariffs, and other banking corruptions, mess
this up.</p><p>One nation&rsquo;s tariffs become another&rsquo;s subsidies. You cannot expect a people who get
squeezed by unfair prices to not fight back, and if they are lucky their government
will fight back for them.</p><p>I guess to be fair to Mehrling, if the aim is to learn how to think like a central
banker, then he has a fair point in leading with the ECB as &ldquo;a bankers bank.&rdquo;
What I am saying is why the F would any student want to learn how to think like a
central banker <em>first</em>? First is a bias.</p><p>So <em>first</em> you want students to think like expertly informed workers, who understand
the (MMT) system, and understand the abuse of it. Then later it is fine to teach them
how central bankers view the system, and why the central bankers are wrong.</p><h2 id=credit-is-not-money><a class=anchor href=#credit-is-not-money title='Anchor for: Credit is not money?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="../../img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Credit is not money?</h2><p>About 2 minutes into the lecture Mehrling seems to take pains to claim &ldquo;Money is <em>not</em>
credit.&rdquo;</p><p>Here he is just plain wrong, at least in language framing.</p><p>He starts with one view of his hierarchy of money: with &ldquo;gold is the ultimate
money&rdquo;. Which is cringe. Gold has never been money. A gold standard is not a regime
where gold is money, it is a regime where temporarily (as long as trust in gold
supply lasts) a government or other currency issuer promises to redeem for gold. When
the gold runs out (or is known to be running out) they always get off the gold
standard until some later time when gold reserves are grabbed back. It is a charade.
No one ever uses the gold for purchasing, it is just a place-holder, just like grain
weights of wheat, corn or barley were used in ancient times, they are just
placeholders for the currency unit. People (who are not fetishists) do not want or
need gold, they want the credits. They need to eat, so they want bread, not gold.
The metal form of the currency is irrelevant.</p><p>All money is an I.O.U of the issuer. So all money is someone&rsquo;s credit (whoever
receives the IOU) and all money is equally someone&rsquo;s debt (the debt of the issuer).
But you might think I am being pedantic?</p><p>It was almost too cringe to listen to the rest of this lecture segment. Mehrling
claims money is how the credit is repaid. True, but that just means money is the
credit. Because in a single currency system all credits and debits are in the same
units. It is all the same money form.</p><p>What Mehrling is getting at is a subtler point, which is that when you have positive
digits in your bank account, or coins or notes in your pocket, then these are unique
IOU&rsquo;s, because they are the only IOU&rsquo;s on Earth that you can redeem for tax liability
extinction. That is why state money <em>seems</em> different to bank credit, but if they are
denominated in the same units then there is no difference, both forms are tax credits,
operationally and legally. The difference is in the process of how you get them into your bank account, or wallet.</p><p>But when the government says by fiat that their tax credit redeems for gold, they are not thereby making the gold the money. They are making gold the buffer stock.
I do not think Mehrling understands this, but it is a critical thing to understand.</p><p>What else Mehrling <em>really</em> means is that commercial bank credit (endogenous money) is
not the same as state currency (exogenous money).</p><p>This is in agreement with MMT, and in agreement with all legal and operational reality
in most nations, outside those who use a foreign currency as their tax credits.</p><p>The difference of course is stark, so I am <em>not</em> being pedantic. There are painful
realities to taking on bank debt. You get the credit initially, along with signing an
explicit or implicit (credit card) agreement to repay. Then you spend, or why else
use a credit card? So your credit gets moved into someone else&rsquo;s bank account, they
are now in credit to the bank, and you are in debt, equally, at least until the
interest charges accrue.</p><p>But when the interest charges accrue the bank gains more credit upon you, and you
gain more in debt, dollar for dollar. So sure enough, endogenously, all credit is
debt.</p><p>However, it holds exogenous as ell, but in an entirely different way, wit profoundly
different consequences, and this is the MMT account of state currency. The state
issues their currency by fiat, not by credit. You do not really need to pay it back.
However, someone has t pay some fraction of it back, due to imposed tax liabilities. But thee are generalize arrangements, and can be arranged so that the poorest people need pay no tax return.
That is the difference.</p><p>Whether you are poor or rich, if you receive bank debt you must repay, or lose your
house, or file form bankruptcy. But if you receive government currency you do not
have to repay, if things are working well, if you are poor, but someone else will
have to pay some fraction of the state&rsquo;s currency back to the state, since taxation
is what drives the demand for the state currency.</p><p>However, and maybe this is something Mehrling gets wrong later on (I am not sure yet)
the bank credit money is only as i demand as the government fiat currency, since the
government licences the banks, and the bank money to any creditors is equivalent to
government issue, since this currency unit is the same unit.</p><p>It is the social consequences of which issuer you get he currency form that matters. it is better to get it as a creditor (work for government, or sell to someone) rather than as a debtor.</p><p><a href=./>Next post (TBD)</a><br><a href=../3_money_veils>Previous post (The Veils of Money)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="../../img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
