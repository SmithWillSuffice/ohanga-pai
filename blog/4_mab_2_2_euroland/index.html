The euro is an MMT system, but very
weirdly structured so as to look and function like a private or endogenous currency
system. But that is one of the veils of money.</p><p>It is easy t make a state currency system (MMMT) look like a private currency.</p><p>Just listen to all the lunatics who claim the US FED is a private bank!
They obviously all believe the US dollar is created by the FED and not by Congress.
They are complete nutters.
But it is easy to forgive them, because Congress also acts like the FED is a hands-off
private entity. So it is a little unfair to blame the nutters for their warped views.
Those in power controlling the USA MMT system share a lot of those warped views.</p><p>If enough people playing a baseball game think it is cricket, what you will observe is
a cricket game played with catching mitts and awkwardly rounded bats.
You see the duality? What does not change are the field, the mitts, the ball,
and the bats, but what is weird is how people use that equipment, the result is a
terrible game of cricket, or a worse game of baseball. (One of those is analogous to
the USA, the other to the EU, perhaps? I am not sure which is more appropriate a
mapping.)</p><p>But how is Merhling any different to the nutters?</p><p>I think Merhling understands the basics of MMT, but if you do, then I think the moral
obligation is to talk about the true account of currency monopoly first, which means
the state theory of money has to go first, because it is primary.</p><p>However, the ECB certianly does function a lot like a private currency endgenous
money system, but that is onyl becasue that is the way the governemtns seem to wish
it to be. And here by &ldquo;the governemtns&rdquo; we really mena those in power. And those in
power in Europe are wannabe oligarchs, so yeah, they are highly prne to abusing the
state currency system and treting it like a private currency system. THis is a major
surce of the mess in euroland.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/XB2DFuAP8SY?list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&t=51" target=_blank>Here is the relvant bit from the lecture</a>
On this I commented:</p><p>All well and good to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; the ECB as a &ldquo;bankers bank&rdquo; if indeed that is what it
is, but it is not, it is a creation of the EU, so is a creation of government(s) the
problem being that is a plural, so only the more powerful members of the EU (Germany,
France, Belgium) really have what is akin to monopoly currency issuing capacity.
Contrast with the USA where Congress has all the monopoly, since they can fire the
FED Board with a vote. The nuance that should be put up-front is that these
governments are <em>de facto</em> owned by the bankers and oligarchs, through distortion of
democracy. So legallistically Merhling is wrong to claim the central banks are
private institutions, but functionally he is kind of right, but only because the
demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively <em>want</em> to be beholden to
private oligarch interests (most neolib politicians aspire to be members of the
oligarchy).</p><p><a href=./>Next post (TBD)</a><br><a href=../2_neural_nets_pt1>Previous post (Neural Nets and MMT)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="../../img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
