mathematics interests. But you know it!&mldr; gonna be tinged with neoliberal
hate. LOL.</p><p>The story was broadcast on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHeWndnHuQs" target=_blank>CBS 60 Minutes here</a>
&mdash; it is a freakin&rsquo; <em>great</em>+story, poorly presented. Except well-presented
with all the professionalism of corporate news!</p><p>Two high school students, Calcea Johnson and Ne&rsquo;Kiya Jackson, seniors at
St. Mary&rsquo;s Academy, <em>independently</em> discovered new proofs of Pythagoras&rsquo;
Theorem using only trigonometry.</p><p>At 2min in the episode both students claim they were interested in solving
the bonus question their teacher had given on a test for a monetary prize
incentive. US$500. Nothing to sneeze at for high school students.
But why did CBS have to air that soundbite? Cos&rsquo; they&rsquo;re neoliberal.</p><p>Let me rant a bit about why this was a big deal, before getting to the core
of this post, which is why the prize incentive was rotten.</p><h2 id=why-such-a-big-deal><a class=anchor href=#why-such-a-big-deal title='Anchor for: Why such a big deal?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Why such a big deal?</h2><ol><li>Trigonometry (ratios of sides of triangles) &mdash; and nothing more &mdash; had
not been able to yield a proof of Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem for over two thousand
years, until
<a href=https://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2009volume9/FG200925.pdf target=_blank>Jason Zimba in 2007</a>
.
(It is well worth reading that paper, it is an easy read.)</li><li>Although Calcea and Ne&rsquo;Kiya were given the puzzle by the same
teacher, and both knew the other was trying to solve it, they worked
independently, and each discovered a different new proof.</li><li>Finding new proofs of old theorems is hard enough itself. (Let alone
finding one most mathematicians considered impossible.)</li></ol><h3 id=the-non-circular-proof><a class=anchor href=#the-non-circular-proof title='Anchor for: The non-circular proof.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The non-circular proof</h3><p>For the macroeconomists, let me just say that very, <em>very</em> good mathematicians
had <em><a href=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED037335.pdf target=_blank>conjectured</a></em> that
that a proof of Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem using <em>only</em> trigonometry functions would
be circular, in that it would assume
$$
\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1
$$
which is of course Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem. (You cannot assume in a proof what
you are trying to prove!)</p><p>BTW, I see this a lot in crackpot physics. People often try to derive the
masses of the elementary particles, but they more often than not have
implicitly assumed the empirical mass, for the electron, for example, people
will take the Compton wavelength as their data.</p><h2 id=the-problem-with-prize-money><a class=anchor href=#the-problem-with-prize-money title='Anchor for: The Problem with Prize Money.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Problem with Prize Money</h2><p>(And the problem with extrinsic rewards entirely.)</p><p>Any decent mathematician would not be solving such a problem for the prize
money. The effort the students put in was worth far more than US$500, if
they had been paid a wage to work on the puzzle. They should have been paid
to work on it if the money was the goal. But while being paid a wage does
not mean one is not learning, <em>not being paid a wage</em> should not be the
price of learning. The price of learning at school should be the real
resources going in to teaching and learning. The money should not be a
question. Just pay the teachers a decent living wage, and hire them locally,
and hire <em>all of them</em> to cut down the class size ratio.</p><p>Prize monies are often like this. Except perhaps for the million dollar
Clay Millenium Prizes and the Nobel, or Abel. Those bigger prizes recognize
lifetime achievements, and so are fair compensation for sacrificing a lot to
work on serious mathematics. For most people they are more than a wage. The
problem is that they are only a wage for <strong><em>one person</em></strong> and this degrades
and demeans the effort of all other people who support the prize winner.
Anyone ever heard of <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em>?</p><p>(No? Of course, you&rsquo;re an Ayn Rand acolyte! LOL.)</p><p><a href=https://www.alfiekohn.org/ target=_blank>Alfie Kohn</a>
, I dare say, would agree with me.
Twitt3r might not, but I&rsquo;m no longer involved in that swamp.</p><h3 id=the-nuances-of-wages><a class=anchor href=#the-nuances-of-wages title='Anchor for: The nuances of wages.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The nuances of wages</h3><p>I am not saying students should be paid to go to school. That issue is
entirely different. Public education is an investment. It should be fully
funded up to available teaching resources. We should not even worry about
the pay-off, since the pay-off is incalculable, but whatever it is, it
is yuuuuge! The private schools like
<a href=https://www.stmarys.academy/ target=_blank>St Mary’s Academy</a>
need to be crowded out,
because they are elitist.</p><p>The placements of Calcea and Ne&rsquo;Kiya are at the school mean other &ldquo;less
Catholic&rdquo; students do not get a place. This is not their fault of course.
I&rsquo;m saying it is a systematic problem with private schools. Not only do they
consume more resources per student than current public schools, the parents
are paying for these, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be. There is no reason public
schools cannot be as nice and hygienic as these private schools. The
private schools prove the real resources are available.</p><p>Sure, sure, admitting less desirable students into the schools messes up the
pristine learning environment for these gifted kids. That&rsquo;s a whole other
problem though, for another day. You cannot ignore it though, otherwise you
give fodder for the elites who demand their kids go to a pristine school if
they pay the money. I am not trying to skirt this issue, I am just writing
about a different issue today, the prizes & rewards issue.</p><p>Let me just say though, that such elitist claptrap can be defeated if we
eliminate poverty and allow the riffraff kids to have a dignified living
environment, a decent breakfast, and parents who are not bitterly struggling
to survive, who have time to read their children Dr Suess stories, or
whatever the better stories are&mldr; Spike Milligan.</p><p>Besides all this, we (society) do pay for children to go to school. We pay
in terms of the real resources committed to schools &mdash; both private and
public. As long as we all are paying in real terms, and the teachers
especially with their labour time, I think we should demand the public
schools get the premium resources. Will this crowd-out the private schools?
Yes, I think so, and good riddance.</p><h3 id=what-about-the-motive><a class=anchor href=#what-about-the-motive title='Anchor for: What about the motive?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What about the motive?</h3><p>The puzzle solving motive is the only motive the students needed.</p><p>Would they then bother to solve the problem?</p><p>Who knows? But they did not <em>need</em> the money prize motive. Why not? Because
they should have been take care of materially, or their parents should have
been taken care of, with decent wages.</p><blockquote><p>Take the money incentive off the table &mdash; unless it is a socially
necessary sh1t job.</p></blockquote><p>Since solving mathematics puzzle is not a sh1t job, we can, and therefore
should, take the money off the table, by providing for the students needs,
by providing for their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; needs.</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; the pedant asks, &ldquo;what if the students then did not bother?&rdquo; I say two
things to this foolishness:</p><ol><li>So what? If they did not bother to work on the puzzle then no one dies,
and they lose out on the chance of discovery. People lose such chances all
the time. What you do not know you lost will not hurt you.</li><li>This would more likely than not reveal the students were not truly
motivated by the money prize, because I bet were finances not an issue
they&rsquo;d still have worked on the puzzle.</li><li>Everyone is capable of providing their own incentive. If you crack the
puzzle treat yourself to a movie &mdash; or whatever floats your boat.</li></ol><p>(I guess I suck at arithmetic.)</p><p>It is a profound lack of creativity to think the students had no motive
other than the money.</p><p>It is a reality they <em>were in fact</em> motivated by the monetary prize, because
to <em>them</em> US$500 dollars was a lot of dinero. But that&rsquo;s utterly beside my
point.</p><h3 id=but-dont-wages-encrudify-labour><a class=anchor href=#but-dont-wages-encrudify-labour title='Anchor for: But don&rsquo;t wages encrudify labour?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>But don&rsquo;t wages encrudify labour?</h3><p>I don&rsquo;t know about that! As I stated, for sh1t jobs wages are bl00dy good.</p><p>For enjoyable jobs we still compensate workers because it is the right
thing to do, even if the worker is having such a wonderful larking time of
it they cannot care about the money. In this case, we${}^\ast$ <em>take the money off
the table</em> by paying a wage that is fair and just above what the worker
considers fine enough not to care about the amount and care more about the
work (enjoyment or utility or both).</p><p>(${}^\ast$Who is this &ldquo;we&rdquo; you might ask? I mean the We if I were supreme
dictator. Or failing that, a simple democracy, full of nasty plebs who
simply want their fair say in the rules of our society.)</p><p>But then the neoliberal wank3r utters, &ldquo;The wage destroys the competition!&rdquo;</p><p>I mean&mldr; sure. With a wage the student can take their own f33t sucking
time trying to crack the mathematics puzzle.</p><p>But what student you know would be taking their s33t a$$ time?</p><p>None I know. There is always competition in sciences because others can
discover the thing first, and then you&rsquo;ve really cocked it up. Discoveries
are not like hamburgers, the first one made is the only one made.</p><p>(There is an exception for school pedagogy: it is a great thing to give
students a solved problem, but get them to try to rediscover a solution.
There is still a marvellous thrill in this, but it&rsquo;s not the same. However,
this pedagogical thrill of re-discovery is even more important than original
discovery, precisely because it is the hamburgers and fries of mathematics
and science. Feeds the masses.)</p><p>But again, it is profound lack of creativity to think students cannot
motivate themselves when they are waged, or have their financial cares met.
How would I motivate myself with some pressure? That&rsquo;s so easy, I can think
of a million ways &mdash; which is to say, the million ways my girlfriend and I
can achieve orgasm.</p><p>What about the teacher wishing to motivate their students?</p><p>Well, for heavens sake do not offer a prize. You can put a deadline on the
puzzle for &ldquo;recognition&rdquo;. But even deadlines are for dummies.</p><p>You can instead just talk to the students! Shock & horror! Does &ldquo;talking&rdquo;
even work? I cannot imagine.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey Calcea and Ne&rsquo;Kiya, so you like this challenge problem?
Well, this is a tough one, it might take a long time, much effort, many
daydreams, and at the end of six months you might get nowhere, like all
humankind for two thousand years. Except in the process you&rsquo;ll have learned
so much interesting geometry your brain will swell and your mind will be
both humbled and proud. Think about that!<br>     &ldquo;Now&mldr; do you want to give yourself a
constraint as a challenge. Say 9 months, but then move on to a new puzzle?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>and then you might say,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mldr; look, if you <em>also</em> want some candy as a prize, we&rsquo;ve got $500 from
the school kitty. That&rsquo;ll get all the chocolate you need for a year. Give
yourselves that if you crack the puzzle, but work on it because it&rsquo;ll grow
your mind, not our belly.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But I personally would <em>not</em> add that bit, it&rsquo;s the real enshittification.
Am I a mean & nasty teacher? Maybe. But no student of mine ever told me so.</p><p>To be clear, if we are not making whole the families of the students, then
yeah, would should damn well offer a wage or a prize. For open puzzles I
prefer a wage, because there is a lot of work to be done, and no guarantee
of success. But it is a poor system that requires this enshittification.</p><p>The neoliberalization of education cuts deep, and has created a festering
wound on our society.</p><p>(&ldquo;Here kids, work on this and teacher will give you candies, but
if you cannot solve it then pi55 off, because you deserve the f-all proportion
of a billion times your present wage.&rdquo;)</p><h2 id=summary-based-mmt-thoughts><a class=anchor href=#summary-based-mmt-thoughts title='Anchor for: Summary based-MMT Thoughts.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Summary based-MMT Thoughts</h2><p>(Well&mldr; <em>I</em> think they&rsquo;re based. 😂)</p><p>Most people are perfectly capable of motivating themselves with scarcity.

The CBS story reported the high creativity shown by Calcea and Ne&rsquo;Kiya,
which is rightly celebrated, but does not stop to ponder how uncreative the
idea of the monetary prize was, and how insidious.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../68_watercare>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../68_watercare>Waterfear</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
