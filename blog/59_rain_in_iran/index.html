is to reign in Iran, the mass of ordinary decent people should be getting
public media stories about how the rain in Iran is the same as the rain in
Africa or Nebraska. (Poetic metaphors here, in case you were wondering.)</p><p>Nima Al-Khurshid had a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbbOR2Ab2wY" target=_blank>talk with Ray McGovern (here)</a>
on possible Iranian state
action to retaliate against Israeli attacks on Iranian officials. Do the
Israeli&rsquo;s seriously think they can righteously target the leaders of other
nations for de facto assassination by
<a href=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-edge-iranian-retaliation-after-embassy-strike-2024-04-12/ target=_blank>bombing in Damascus</a>
?</p><p>Of course they do. Or they convince themselves they are righteous by
self-delusion, aggressive PR and generations of indoctrination in their
schools and military service traditions. If you do not know about this already
I can recommend Miko Peled&rsquo;s book <a href=https://mikopeled.com/ target=_blank>“The General’s Son”</a>
for as good an insider&rsquo;s candid account of Israeli indoctrination as you can
find, and how banal it is in its evil.</p><p>No one should deny the state of Israel the right to self-defence, but they
long ago stepped well past legitimate self-defence, and have become an
apartheid terrorist state. Only the other day, shame on me, did I learn
Israel had been a pretty staunch supporter of the former South African
apartheid regime. The things you learn! That&rsquo;s so F$\ast$-ed up.)
Israel has lost moral legitimacy. In having done so the leaders of the nation
have harmed their own people far more than any Hamas, PLO, or Hezbollah
resistance attack ever could. Little do they know.</p><p>The world is afflicted with people who can only see harm in visible material
reality, people in general never look to the spiritual harm that emotionally
violently afflicts generations. All the Millennial and Z-Gen Israeli youth who
have become twisted sociopaths and virtual right-wing racist fascists. That&rsquo;s
the deepest harm. It takes a courageous person to pull back from right-wing
extremism and denounce violence and racism. Their ego needs to take a big hit,
they need to develop genuine empathy for their former perceived enemy, and
regard them as human beings, and that courage is rare. It is far easier
(perhaps paradoxically?) to be cynical, hateful and nihilistic.</p><p>Why paradoxical? Because in the longer run cynicism and hatred are extremely
costly, and extremely damaging to society. The harder road to take of peace
and forgiveness is only initially hard, in the long run it leads to
friendship, happiness, safety and prosperity.</p><p>Anyhow, I left this comment for Nima and his audience:</p><blockquote><p>@22:30 when you can so easily &ldquo;.. blend in with the indigenous&mldr;&rdquo; like a Lloyd Austin this is <em><em>not</em></em> so much a &ldquo;deep state&rdquo;. It is an open transparent corruption of an entire nation. The USA is in this wise no more a republic nor a democracy than Iran or Nth Korea. There is only supposed to be two layers separating the mass of US citizens from who gets appointed to the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; &mdash; their locally elected officials and the primary elections which create the pool for the election of those representatives. In reality the US citizen has no say in who gets appointed to the deep state because they really have no say in the root level of the primaries.
It is &ldquo;deep&rdquo; for sure, in the sense of ingrained and infested with liars and psychopaths). But the deepest rot is at the base level, your electoral system and how anti-democratic it is. One very reasonable measure to show it was democratic (necessary but not sufficient) would be the probability distribution of prior earned income of the representatives. It&rsquo;d be gaussian and centered on about the average US worker wage.
Never think that this deep state is solely a consequence of the idiocy or greed-for-power of your government representatives. The USA as a collective people (led by the not so pure and saintly small group of &ldquo;founding fathers&rdquo;) once had a good idea to establish a representative democracy, but never actually managed to implement the ideal. We cannot blame the average US citizen for the present diseased state of US politics, but we can sure as heck blame every single person with agency in the USA for not lifting a finger to do something about it <em>in their own small insignificant way</em> (e.g., by engage with family and friends on these issues, to generate groundswell for overthrowing neoliberalism and Its Mont Pelerin bred ilk non-violently) &mdash; because it is only the small actions of all people working together in harmony that can erode such a corrupt system, unless you are all prepared to sit idly by and wait for accelerationism to &ldquo;work&rdquo; its havoc through more poverty and death by neoliberal austerity.</p></blockquote><h3 id=mcgovern-mentions-poverty><a class=anchor href=#mcgovern-mentions-poverty title='Anchor for: McGovern Mentions Poverty.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>McGovern Mentions Poverty</h3><p>Ray said there is a passage in the Bible where Mary speaks. Something about
Jesus coming to fill up the poor with riches and leave the rich without.
He interpreted it literally, which is always a sad mistake. Literal
interpretations of any holy scriptures should be at first allegorical, if
you want to overlay some literal meaning you&rsquo;d better be careful, since as
the enlightenment supposedly taught the common people, the literal
interpretations make the scriptures inconsistent. In my autistic (I suppose?)
naïveté I thought everyone understood this (I do not talk to people enough
to know much popular conception and opinion). My comment:</p><blockquote><p>@33: [cough!] that was not really what Biblical scripture was teaching. The
idea was Jesus would &ldquo;fill up the poor&rdquo; with riches &ldquo;of the Kingdom&rdquo; &mdash;
meaning spiritual virtues, which are far more valuable than material riches,
for they are how decent civilization endures for all, not just for one. If you
focus on material wealth and material riches you will miss 99% of the meaning
in holy scriptures of all denominations. The point being, material prosperity
is terrific too, but you only achieve that justly for all people with spiritual
prerequisites &mdash; trustworthiness, honesty, compassion, love, kindness,
forgiveness. When we achieve fair prosperity for all, counter to mainstream
economics ideas, the rich disappear, not because God or marxists vanquished
them nor Keynes&rsquo;s ghost euthanized them, but they disappear because they
become nothing but the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; &mdash; but willingly, because they too
gain a spiritual capacity and so spend their wealth upon the poor.<br>     However charity does not eliminate poverty,
only governments can eliminate nominal poverty (deficiency of tax credits),
since the government is always the monopoly issuer of the tax credits, either
by fiat or by state chartered banks through credit circulation. Governments
are the direct cause of nominal poverty, but little do people running the
government know. If they did know they would also know how to immediately
eliminate all nominal poverty their currency system causes (by employing for
public good all people seeking to exchange their labour for the tax credit
who cannot find employment in the private sector). The point of all <em>that</em> is
to note we will never have decent governments until a significant critical
mass of ordinary people are also spiritually alive.<br>      A materialistic greedy society will have
a materialistic corrupt government that will not even wish to understand the
source of unemployment is the State.<br>      The state is the cause of all unemployment
in the currency it monopoly issues, but is then also the sole body that
can eliminate all the unemployment it created. the purpose of imposing tax
liabilities is to drive <em>demand</em> for an otherwise worthless currency, this
creates people seeking to earn the currency (aka. unemployed) the purpose of
this is not to leave anyone unemployed, but to hire all the workers the State
just created by imposing tax liabilities. Residual involuntary unemployment
is a simple policy mistake, a tragic one.</p></blockquote><h2 id=social-media-note><a class=anchor href=#social-media-note title='Anchor for: Social Media Note.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Social Media Note</h2><p>For anyone who cares to know, I abandoned Twitter last year, partly because
personally I had lost a woman I considered my one true love and soul mate, so
as emotionally unable to cope with much of ordinary life, and the pain has not
faded, six months later, and shows no sign of ever fading. They say
&ldquo;time heals all wounds&rdquo; but I am amassing evidence this is not 100% true. But
also because I no longer consider Twitter/X to be an ethical platform, if it
ever was, it certainly is no longer.</p><p>It is not even clear the &ldquo;social&rdquo; aspect of Twitter is effective. At least
not for anyone with less than a million or so followers. So it is not a social
platform. It is he/she who gains the most celebrity who speaks the loudest.
That&rsquo;s not democracy, that&rsquo;s not populist. It is a magnification of the worst
of a capitalist winner-take-all type of system.</p><p>If you think Twitter/X is a public space, frankly you are an idiot.</p><p>Yet what is a nobody like me to do with their activist energy? I do not know
what is best, I have not been at the macroeconomics justice activist game
for long enough to be an expert on effective methods. For now I am just
thinking working on some projects and talking to one or two people who have
some influence is a fair start.</p><p>Ultimately though, I think public media has to grow up and become the voice
of the people, as befitting the purpose public journalism was once thought to
serve. It is no longer a voice of the people, it is a groupthink vehicle
manufacturing consent for the neoliberals.</p><p>Those whop comprehend MMT know this more than most.</p><p>What deep state ills have your tax-payer dollars been up to funding
recently, huh?</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../58_gizza_gov>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../60_wealth_maldistribution>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../58_gizza_gov>Gizza Gov'</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../60_wealth_maldistribution>Gold Maldistribution</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
