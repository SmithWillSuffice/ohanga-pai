<a href="https://bijou.substack.com/p/king-tong-say-our-people-goto-factory?r=3hsqj" target=_blank>wrote a piece</a>
on two interrelated MMT topics,</p><ol><li>the concepts of &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;,</li><li>the idea exports could be a real benefit.</li></ol><p>Both are anti-MMT framing, and my article explains why, at least from my
MMT lens perspective.</p><p>Today here on the blog I wanted to record a note less for public consumption,
so it will not go on the open substack. This note amplifies but abbreviates
my public substack piece.</p><img src=/ohanga-pai/images/factory_worker_king_tongs.png alt="Battle of Quasi Kings" style=width:600px><div style=text-align:center;font-style:italic;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%>How to get foreigners to agree to allow you to make stuff for them, monarchist style.</div><h2 id=a-trade-tête-à-tête><a class=anchor href=#a-trade-tête-à-tête title='Anchor for: A Trade Tête-à-tête.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Trade Tête-à-tête</h2><p><strong>Background:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been writing in parallel with Jim Byrne over in Scotland
with his MMT-101 project. He&rsquo;s a good guy. Jim was backing Fadhel Kaboub&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; framing, and I gave a little push back. Then Jim responded,
telling me to &ldquo;read this&rdquo;&mldr;</p><p>Ref: Jim&rsquo;s article <a href="https://mmt101.substack.com/p/your-bare-bones-guide-to-monetary?r=3r8qc" target=_blank>https://mmt101.substack.com/p/your-bare-bones-guide-to-monetary?r=3r8qc</a></p><p>I do not want to trouble anyone much, but I drafted a fairly stern reply to
Jim, and wondered if it would be wise to post openly. I decided maybe not. It
is more of an MMT insider issue I feel. Not a desire for some sort of weird
&ldquo;MMT Purity&rdquo;, but more for consistent language framing and concept clarity.
I always like concept clarity &mdash; again, not for any hermetic purity reasons,
but for intellectual ease. It troubles my head if I have to think too deeply
about what may be otherwise simple concepts (this happens an awful lot in
theoretical physics).</p><p>So I wrote to Jim telling him I disagree (respectfully) with Fadhel, and
always have. Money has nothing overtly to do with food and energy and so
forth, but does have something to do with state power & authority. He is
redefining terms, and I do not like his redefinition, they are clouding some
issues in my view.</p><p>((I am &ldquo;punching up&rdquo; here massively, note. Fadhel is one of the credentialed
elites, and I am a nobody. I feel I need to mention this because there&rsquo;s a
lot of confusion these days about academic respectability. My position is
that you have to respect good peer reviewed research. The contemporary issue
is what happens when the peer review is bad? Who is peer reviewing the peer
reviewers? This is the question!<br>     The question is not as some cranks like Sabine
Hossenfelder and Eric Weinstein constantly whinge and moan about that academia
is rotten. The best research is still coming out of academia and well equipped
laboratories. Are they sincerely and spiritually motivated though, or just
motivated by the imposed need to seek grant funds outside of stable salary
and block grants? To the extent academics are motivated only by making monetary
profit I think their research should be distrusted at the outset. But this
does not implicate all that much of academic research. Anyhow, this is just to
say you need have no reason to trust what I write, you should think things
through for yourself and be part of the communal peer review. This can on
occasion be superior to academic peer review, but is not intrinsically
superior, nor is academic review intrinsically superior. It is just mostly
good, and sometimes bad.))</p><h3 id=the-mmt-frame-as-i-see-it><a class=anchor href=#the-mmt-frame-as-i-see-it title='Anchor for: The MMT Frame (as I see it).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The MMT Frame (as I see it)</h3><p>The currency is a way to get a society going with proper records of account
and a robust public sector, if a government has this then they are monetary
sovereign. It blurs boundaries and useful categorizations to otherwise frame
things the way Fadhel does. (And I do not even know what &ldquo;technological
sovereignty&rdquo; means, it sounds like a made-up notion — what community has ever
in all history had technology &ldquo;without reliance on foreign knowledge&rdquo;? None
as far as I can tell, except in the unrecorded stone-age. Isaac Newton: <em>we
stand on the shoulders of giants</em>.)</p><p>Having stated that, it is indeed a huge problem if a nation is not energy
and food self-sufficient. But they&rsquo;re not going to do any better than use
MMT policy space wisely. Every well-formed country has legislative and
monetary sovereignty, period. It is a good base to start from.</p><p>Saying, &ldquo;&mldr; full <em>monetary</em> sovereignty unless it has sovereignty over
four key areas&mldr;&rdquo; is a definition is all. I think it is dopey. What I can
agree with is simply remove one word:</p><p>&ldquo;&mldr; <em>full sovereignty</em> includes these four conditions&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>You do not need to drag &ldquo;money&rdquo; in on top, it is already the first of the
four conditions, so stating it as &ldquo;&mldr; money sovereignty is&mldr;&rdquo; &mdash; is
redundant, which reveals the silliness of the language framing the way
Fadhel insists. The thing is, it serves no useful framing, he does not have
to insist a nation lacks money sovereignty. Besides, by Mosler&rsquo;s definitions
Fadhel&rsquo;s is simply false. Who&rsquo;s definition do you prefer then? I prefer the
one that removes the redundancy. Call it my theoretical physics bias (it
matters a lot in physics, like a difference between stability and violent
blow-up to infinity),</p><p>Not my definition. Of course Fadhel is free to go with his definition, but
it would be dishonest to call it &ldquo;MMT&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d thus advise against, since it
is somewhat de-powering. Food and energy insufficiency can always be overcome
with good imports and assistance from wealthier nations. I think this is
Fadhel&rsquo;s point, but he should lead with it! MMT in isolation is not enough
for an isolated unsustainable nation. But it is the best a nation can do
domestically up to policy choices. With full MMT policy space available the
nation is as &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; as it can possibly be absent international relations.</p><p>I like Fadhel, he does great work on developmental economics, but I think he
is co-opting &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; here in an unhelpful way. Even MMT101 has stated &ldquo;MMT is
just a lens&rdquo;. I think we should stick to that, it is useful categorization
and compartmentalization, while allowing for more holistic macroeconomic
understandings. Talk to Warren & Bill about this! This is just my personal
opinion, filtered through my highly autistic brain. Hopefully Mosler & Mitchell
can convince you if I cannot.</p><h2 id=the-full-metal-wrap><a class=anchor href=#the-full-metal-wrap title='Anchor for: The Full Metal Wrap.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Full Metal Wrap</h2><p>Maybe when all is said and done for today, I just think the talk about
&ldquo;sovereignties&rdquo; is a might too cute for my taste. If the final conclusions
are the same then I guess I should not care too much how much of a convoluted
garden path people like Fadhel take to get there, maybe you just need to
write academic papers that are longer than a few sentences to justify your
salary? Here is my academic paper, for which I had a Warren Mosler seal of
approval &mdash; in fact I almost stole these words off Warren, but he freely
offered them up:</p><blockquote><p>Consider this &lsquo;pyramid&rsquo;:<br>In today&rsquo;s so-called civilized world, none of us, for all practical
purposes, is self-sufficient. We &lsquo;import&rsquo; food, clothing, shelter, energy,
etc. from others.<br>      No village, town, or city is self-sufficient.<br>      No state is self-sufficient.<br>      No nation is self-sufficient.<br>      And we are all better off for it.
Well-being is enhanced by expanding all this.<br>      The only thing gained by going backwards
towards full self-sufficiency is security. That only needs to be done in a
few limited resource areas. With an imagined (but not unrealistic) proper United
Nations structure this security need can be incredibly minimal, which saves
effort among all nations and reduces the burden on necessary labour which is
always dumped upon the working class. We need to really eliminate that
economic class divide. All can be workers (during able years of life), and
we are all better off for it. When you&rsquo;re dealing with friends,
you minimize the security risks. So I support <em>making the world safer by relying upon trade,</em> by relinquishing some limited &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;. We will create a
better world this way.${}^\dagger$</p></blockquote><p>${}^\dagger$If tankies and ultranationalists disagree then I&rsquo;m going to
go with <em>well, that only helps prove my case.</em></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../100_defeating_materialism_is_defeating_neoliberalism>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../102_peekaboo_inflation_scare_mongering_prelude>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../100_defeating_materialism_is_defeating_neoliberalism>Defeating Materialism Is Defeating Neoliberalism</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../102_peekaboo_inflation_scare_mongering_prelude>Bogeyman Prelude</a></td></tr></table></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
