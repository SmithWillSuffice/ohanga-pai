After a long gap between Ōhanga Pai
posts I have two in short succession. This one could turn out juicier, since
it is a complex topic. The occasion is coming across a Santa Fe Institute
public talk on central planning:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Hghul4oEI" target=_blank>“Comrades, Let&amp;rsquo;s Optimize! The Surprising Rebirth of the Planned Economy”</a>
at SFI, March 10. The guest speaker was Francis Spufford
who wrote a book called <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18634818-red-plenty target=_blank>“Red Plenty”</a></p><h2 id=setting-the-scene><a class=anchor href=#setting-the-scene title='Anchor for: Setting the Scene.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Setting the Scene</h2><p>I am pretty sure Spufford is getting a lot of things wrong. He reckons the
Soviet Union was founded on a sort of communist fairy tale of the merits of a
planned economy.</p><p>But as Michael Hudson will often point out, all economies are more or less
centrally planned. The question is whether they are &ldquo;centrally planned&rdquo;
nebulously by Wall Street (or your nation&rsquo;s equivalent) or the public via a
representative democratic government, or via an autocracy.</p><p>The secondary question concerns what methods each form of government will
employ. That makes a huge difference, if one of the goals is efficiency and
minimum waste, then there are serious scientific questions to ask about which
form of planning is the superior. I think it is fair to say economists do
not truly know the answer.</p><p>Yet is aught to also be fair to say all economists should agree unemployment is
a massive waste of real resources, and that any economic system tolerating
unemployment is not the best one you could have.. Unfortunately, and this is
truly crazy, it seems most mainstream orthodox economists are quite happy in
thinking unemployment is <em>not</em> a waste, and is in (their) facts a necessity,
for market efficiency.</p><p>Only MMT can truly point out why this is false. (The post-Keynesians never
could make the argument against tolerating unemployment.)</p><p>Also, the fairy tale of the Soviets may have been a thing, a hoped for future
many Soviets thought was realistic. But the (false) myth about this is that
the Soviets were in fact communists. they were not. They never got even close
to any form of socialism. From the Bolshevik get-go gun it was a hierarchical
system, anti-democratic, ruled by a powerful committee of elites armed with a
secrete police (and all the other police). Hence closer to Wall Street
lobbyist controlled USA government than to say an extremely large kibbutzim
or the like.</p><p>The fairy tale was probably real in the minds of many Russians, but they were
hopeless deluding themselves, or perhaps not, perhaps they innocently believed
in the benevolence of the central committee, so were not to be faulted. Who
doesn&rsquo;t want to believe their government is benevolent? (That&rsquo;s rhetorical,
rugged individual libertarians who never had any parents need not answer.)
Same as any child: you do not like learning your parents are stupid normal
people with nothing special about them, except hopefully they love you nearly
unconditionally.</p><p>((I am not invoking the false &ldquo;government as household&rdquo; analogy here, just an
analogy about an internal power dynamic within a given system.))</p><h1 id=initial-reactions>Initial Reactions</h1><p>Maybe I won&rsquo;t get to the end of it, but forn starters here was my first
reaction:</p><blockquote><p>Spufford really nerds out far too much. And the intro was wrong. When there
is a monopoly issuer of a sovereign currency there is no &ldquo;free market&rdquo;. There
is a secondary market that is free enough to determine relative prices. But
the macroeconomics price level can only come from one source, the government.
Whether you like it or not. The monopolist has to either fix price (let supply
float) or fix quantity (and let price fluctuate), or some mish-mash hybrid (out
of sheer ignorance, which is the case today with all governments). There is
only one good choice for a macroeconomy, which is to fix price and allow
supply to float, which means the government deficit float, and is not
targeted. Instead full useful employment is targeted, using a job guarantee
as a floor.<br>      The point is, the monopoly currency issuer
can always determine the price level, e.g., using the automatic stabilizers
(progressive tax brackets for currency withdraw, job guarantee for base
currency supply at a fixed price). Net government spending less tax return is
the net financial wealth (in the state&rsquo;s unit of account) of the rest of the
economy. At this macro level it is not a &ldquo;complex system&rdquo;. It is a monopoly.
It is complicated because of political psychology and inherent power dynamics
controlling the monopoly, but it does not have to be either 100% planned nor
100% anarchic. It&rsquo;s a political choice to have unemployment (massive waste of
real resources, lost output that can never be recovered), the wrong choice.<br>      In the USA and most nations, we have
oligarchy not because government is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; per se, nor because government is
beholden to market forces, but rather more because the oligarchs control
government. It does not have to be this way. And it does not have to be
centrally planned either. If you understand the monetary system you can
design any sort of social economy you desire. I&rsquo;d suggest a proper democracy,
with full employment in non-bs jobs, which is nowhere to be found.</p></blockquote><p>I felt I had to follow-up:</p><blockquote><p>Any decent economist who understands dynamics (so is not enthralled by
neoclassical equilibrium mush-brain thinking) and non-linearity will know why
a job guarantee is not an inflation risk. Rising government net spending is
also not inflationary if given a growing population. A growing population must
have a growing money supply, otherwise there will be widespread bank credit
issuance, which is a major instability without a mechanism for debt
forgiveness (a debt that cannot be repaid is a credit that was fraudulently
or ignorantly issued).<br>      The heated-up economy (in monetary
circulation terms, not necessarily energy use) does not lead to nominal
inflation if the higher circulation results <em><em>automatically</em></em> in higher
tax redemption, which it almost always does, unless the rich have conned
government into getting themselves zero tax rates and interest-income by
the trillions. Mosler&rsquo;s 7th DIF: higher government deficits today can cause
higher tax return tomorrow. This is not a myth, it is true, the myth is that
it is a bad thing. The truth is it is a good thing. Higher tax returns (with
no change in tax code) is a mere signal of a stronger economy. The tax return
does not fund the government when the government is the original issuer of
the currency by fiat. Tax return is a redemption operation, not a funding
operation. Or, for the simple-minded: &ldquo;Taxes do not finance government
spending.&rdquo;<br>      It is the imposition of tax liabilities
that is import: this drives <em><em>demand</em></em> for an otherwise worthless token
(scorepoints in bank accounts these days). A &ldquo;money thing&rdquo; is worthless unless
it is redeemable. Governments have never defaulted on these redemptions, why
would they refuse return of their own currency?<br>      The answer is they <em>might</em> &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; in
order to not withdraw too much currency from circulation, because they desire
a strong economy!! But this &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; could simply be lowering tax rates.
(Yet in our times little do politicians know this is the reason to lower
taxes.) Politicians who think taxes fund the government are essentially &ldquo;evil&rdquo;
in the form of gross ignorance.<br>      Same with Treasury bonds. These are
entirely pointless instruments when the currency is on a floating exchange
rate. On a float there is simply no need for government to offer a risk-free
savings asset. That&rsquo;s because when on a float the Government does not need
to sell bonds to lock-up Its own currency for a term to stabilize the exchange
rate, the exchange rate is floated! The function of selling bonds is to set a
base interest rate. But this is nothing but
<em><em>basic income but only for people who already have money in proportion to how much money they already have.</em></em> So it is highly regressive. The stable policy is a
zero interest rate, and ensure licensed banks can do <em><em>nothing but</em></em> assess
credit worthiness and run the payments layer (so hold check accounts and term
deposits), thus ensuring banks cannot issue fraudulent credit, and the market
can determine the interest rate above the government base rate of zero.</p></blockquote><p>But then, I thought, does that not say it all? What more is there to say about
the myth of central planning and the myth of free markets?</p><p>Perhaps it is worth repeating &mdash; but in a different style &mdash; for emphasis:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../53_silo_tokens>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../53_silo_tokens>Silo Tokens</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../55_total_value.md>Total Value Recall</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
