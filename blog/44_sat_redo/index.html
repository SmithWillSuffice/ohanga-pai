but every so often Veritasium or some other offers a click bait title I
cannot resist. There was this on on the infamous SAT coin rolling problem.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg" target=_blank>“The SAT Question Everyone Got Wrong”</a></p><p>That&rsquo;s intriguing because you know there&rsquo;s a deeper story behind it than
merely &ldquo;it was just a hard problem&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=sat-administration><a class=anchor href=#sat-administration title='Anchor for: SAT Administration.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>SAT Administration</h2><p>The issue that prompted this blog today is the almost throw-away remark
Veritasium made near the end on the inability of the SAT to re-score all the
tests, citing it&rsquo;d cost too much money that &ldquo;came out of the pockets of the
test takers.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought:</p><ol><li>Why would they charge people for a re-score, if the question was known to
be bogus? It&rsquo;s an ethics issue, not a finance issue, and SAT board got the
ethics wrong.</li><li>The cost is in real terms &ndash; the examiners could be doing something better,
or could they? It is still a public good to be fixing badly scored tests.</li><li>The monetary cost is then irrelevant, the government just marks up the bank accounts of the examiners who have to re-score all the tests. Fair compensation
for these workers, presumably they were not the ones writing the bad question.</li></ol><p>Hopefully someone at Veritasium takes note of my comment:</p><blockquote><p>@15:25 SAT officials made another huge error of <em>far more overriding
importance</em> in fact an epic tragedy. The cost of redoing the scoring does
<em><em>not</em></em> &ldquo;come out of the pockets of test takers&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a macroeconomic myth.
There is in fact no such thing as &ldquo;tax payer funding&rdquo;. No one can pay a dime
in tax until the issuer of the currency first issues it, or licences chartered
banks as agents of the state to issue credit (which is not net currency
creation, has to be paid back with interest). Tax payers cannot (legally)
fund the government in monetary terms, that&rsquo;d mean they&rsquo;re engaging in
counterfeit. Tax payers and others &ldquo;fund&rdquo; the government in <em><em>real terms</em></em> by
exchanging their goods or labour in return to that which is accepted for
payment of taxes, fees, levies and other imposed liabilities (aka. US dollars,
or yen, pounds, euro, peso, etc. the numeraire for whatever country imposes
these liabilities by force of the state).<br>      Only the US government can issue USD by
fiat, and they tell you what it&rsquo;s worth, and the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; is a vote in Congress
for the authorization, the operation is simply taking a computer at the
central bank and typing in numbers to mark up the bank accounts of the
employees re-marking the SAT test. That&rsquo;s a real cost in terms of those
employees could be doing something else more useful perhaps, but it is not a
monetary cost for any tax payer, in fact the issued wage for the government
employees gets spent (presumably) thus helping someone else pay their taxes.<br>      The reason why this error is an epic
tragedy is that it applies not just to lack of willingness to re-score SAT
tests, but to the entire macroeconomy. The false thinking about &ldquo;tax payer
funding&rdquo; is a cause of neoliberal austerity policy and massive wastes of human
lives in unemployment &mdash; forever lost output &mdash; exceeding the costs of all
major wars in human history.</p></blockquote><p>OK, that the macro.</p><p>Sounds like SAT is begin phased out. Probably good riddance.
Entrance qualifications for university programs do need to be in place,
limited teaching resources and all that, but with MIT, Standford, Harvard and
other universities freely able to publish lectures and course materials
online, no paper printing cost and whatnot, do we really need to restrict
university placements? Perhaps we do? After all, chatGPT is showing there is
still a role for teachers, it requires honest human work to assess students
for certifications if they&rsquo;re able to plagiarize chatGPT.</p><p>If universities are going to continue as our main source of higher education
and qualification, then standard need to be met. But information technology is
constantly lowering the real costs involved, and universities should be
lowering the cost of education, not increasing it! This is a public funding
issue.</p><p>Also I&rsquo;m talking about inflation adjusted costs, so the real costs.</p><p>If the real resources we once had are still available they have to be
realistically in total a lot cheaper now, so university fees should be
practically zero. The real cost to enter a university and do all the
formalities of accreditation should be the intellectual cost. You have to
prove you are worthy.</p><p>On that score, I advocate giving students all the time they need. There is no
need for a rush through college. If they fail a course once, provided they
wish to continue and have the entrance requirements, let them keep trying.</p><h2 id=the-coin-puzzle><a class=anchor href=#the-coin-puzzle title='Anchor for: The Coin Puzzle.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Coin Puzzle</h2><blockquote><p>Roll a circle of radius $R/3$ around a bigger circle of radius $R$. How many
times will the smaller circle rotate around it&rsquo;s center?</p></blockquote><p>Apparently a 1980&rsquo;s SAT test did not offer the correct answer in the
multichoice.</p><p>Most students would say it rotates $3$ times around, since the smaller coin circumference being $2\pi R/3$ unrolls $3$ times get once around the larger
coin of circumference $2\pi R$.</p><p>However, this is not the case.</p><p>While the story about the circumferences is correct, it does not dictate the
full rotation of the small coin around it&rsquo;s center, that&rsquo;s because in
<em>addition</em> to unrolling it&rsquo;s circumference around the bigger coin, the smaller
coin is also &ldquo;in orbit&rdquo; (so-to-speak) around the larger coin, and that orbit
accounts for one extra rotation.</p><p>Hence the total number of rotations of the small coin is $3+1 = 4$.</p><h3 id=generalizations><a class=anchor href=#generalizations title='Anchor for: Generalizations.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Generalizations</h3><p>The cool thing in the Veritasium episode is the generalization to rolling a
circle around any shape. Triangle, square, pentagon, or even a line.</p><p>For only one of these will the small circle rotate around it&rsquo;s center the
naive expected perimeter divided by small circle circumference number of
times. Which one?</p><p>Answer: The line of course. (No additional orbit.)</p><p>What about rolling to coin inside another shape?</p><p>In this case the inner &ldquo;orbit&rdquo; is subtractive, you have to subtract one
circumference. So the result is the ratio of the shape&rsquo;s perimeter to the
small coin circumference minus $1$.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:25%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../43_demystify_deb>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../43_demystify_deb>Israle/Palestine</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
