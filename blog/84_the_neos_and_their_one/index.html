Had some thoughts about the Neoliberals and Fascism.
Old story of how the former becomes the latter.
New take on it?
</code></pre><p>Hey math geeks, did you know there’s a functor from Neoliberals to
Fascists? For normies: yeah, it is called “a straight line”, or at worst
a “Zebra crossing”. Highly technical stuff.</p><p>Hey film geeks, don’t be snowflakes, artistic interpretation is subjective.
If you want to think of Neo as merely an abstract embodiment of all human
knowledge and hacking ability, then he’s not a fascist, he’s a commie, or
maybe an anarchist? De gustibus non est disputandum.</p><p>One recent episode of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHe7shPDJ0" target=_blank>The Majority Report</a>
.
The guest, Richard Seymour, had a generally reasonable report on fascism
today in the USA.<br>Fun stuff&mldr; not.</p><p>However, at one point he misspoke (I presume) and said the far-right in
the USA are seeking a white majoritarian populace, so they can exploit
good ol&rsquo; democracy.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter whiteman, you no like tyranny of the
minority anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>I had to comment:</p><blockquote><p>No, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHe7shPDJ0&t=690s" target=_blank>@11:30</a>
— they
are certainly not advocating majoritarian democracy.
That would be actual democracy. They want (or really just &ldquo;need&rdquo; since I&rsquo;m
sure some of them want the lot) &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; ethnic cleansing, so
&ldquo;ethnic rinsing,&rdquo; to <em>gain</em> a majority, and more importantly they want
political psychology indoctrination, so a majority will support neoliberal
policies even if they lack a majority (which they will lack, for sure,
demographics!). These are &ldquo;not yet fully fledged fascists&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s
a constraint of time. It takes time to indoctrinate people. Neoliberalism
took decades. The Boomers do not remember <em><em>how</em></em> they grew up in an era
of economic prosperity (the &ldquo;how&rdquo; was due to barely above mediocre
government support for labour).<br>      How did they forget <em>that</em> was a good era
for society &mdash; and would&rsquo;ve been even better had the Cold War and
colonial/slavery and sexist remnants been absent? They did not forget of
course, most want &ldquo;MAGA&rdquo;. So what&rsquo;s the deal?<br>      The deal is they completely
forgot what <em>caused</em> half-decent economic prosperity: the cause
was government support for labour and unions (milquetoast support, but still
it was non-vanishing). They forgot because of <em>general ambient</em>
neoliberal shock doctrine in effect all over the place,
which was aided by the OPEC oil crisis, and vicious unrelenting anti-union
propaganda and CIA infiltrations (or the analog in other countries) &mdash; nothing
better than corrupt union bosses and violent &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; radicals to aid the
neoliberal cause in popular Socer Mom and NASCAR Dad normie consciousness
(controlled opposition). That OPEC inflation was not a natural markets
effect, it was a monopolist setting price, not the workers with their
outrageous wage demands.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve got to believe most ordinary people still do not want violent
revolution and overthrow of governments. I&rsquo;ve got to believe most
democratically elected representatives are not pure rentier wannabe
sǝןoɥssɐ.</p><p>By the way, as outrageous as it sounds, I think I&rsquo;d still trust a
Soccer Mom or NASCAR Dad to back me on wise fiscal policy ahead of an
over-educated economics or business school graduate. The latter species
are practically bred psychopaths. Whoa! Too &ldquo;populist&rdquo; for you? Go read
Thomas Franks.</p><p>Not because I trust people in general, I don&rsquo;t, I just trust people because
I want them to be trustworthy. Like the LBW law in Cricket, benefit of
the doubt.</p><p>This can get you into trouble if the batting side is on a hot streak.
I admit. But I am not talking here about the power elites, I am talking
about good ordinary working people and the unemployed. If they crave violent
revolution I&rsquo;m not with them, except if the violence is all intellectual
and plays out in policy, not fisticuffs (a euphemism if ever there was one).</p><p>We should want to <em>overthrow governments</em> but this means the people running
the government, not the institution itself <em>per se</em>. History proves this,
regardless of which side you were on, if any, the fall of the Berlin Wall
(and all the events surrounding) showed a government can change tune
practically overnight, without ceasing to be government.
This can be rapidly accomplished through spiritual education, not technocracy
and fake-meritocracy (aka. credentialism). I&rsquo;ve never seen a bad idea that
wasn&rsquo;t thoroughly defeated with wisdom.</p><p>Governments are not bound by laws of historical materialism. There are no
such laws. We do not have to wait for the non-existent &lsquo;falling rate of
profit&rsquo; to materialize. We already have the spiritual means to reform
government, and kick the current bunch of idiots out of power. The catch
to this is we need massive collective action, because the mainstream media
is entirely within the thrall of the financial elites and their socially
parasitic brainworms. That&rsquo;s my point: there is no effective massive
collective action absent massive education and wisdom. This takes time.
It can be agonizing. It <em>is</em> agonizing.</p><p>This is why all my writing is
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html target=_blank>free-libre Copyleft</a>
.
It does no good to wait for donations before I write. This means, anyone
can copy what is on Ōhanga Pai and modify as they please, provided you
credit the author for his or her original bits, and not miss-attribute
by omission.</p><p>I know this all <em>looks and sounds</em> naïve, if it does to you then I am
sorry for you. To be clear: I am not peddling the Clinton/Obama/Bush
narrative of, &ldquo;Go to school and learn to code!&rdquo; &mdash; oh no, no no!
$\mathfrak{fUCK}$ that.</p><p>I truly do mean <em>spiritual</em> education: teaching and practicing honesty,
love, kindness, forgiveness, justice, mercy, compassion and humility.
You&rsquo;d be surprised Mr Technocrat at the RBNZ and Treasury, how far such
spiritual virtues get in arriving at good macroeconomic policy. Better
than all your electricity draining computer models combined. Even beats
that sometimes mush-brained &ldquo;Green-Fascist with software&rdquo;${}^\dagger$
technocrat Prof. Steve Keen. (I can write that, he&rsquo;s a friend, so can get
the joke&mldr; if he is in a good non-UBI boosting mood.)</p><p>${}^\dagger$ The full title would be &ldquo;Green-Fascist with software that
proves accounting identities by assuming the accounting identities.&rdquo;
Too on-the-nose? lol.</p><hr><p>Damn, I had a clever idea to fit with the title, something about how the
online gaming nerds boost the Trumpistas, the Silicon Valley AI
technofeudalists and the Elon&rsquo;s, as sort of Mr Anderson/Neo saviours. But that
topic is a bit toxic for my brain and mental health today. I&rsquo;m a math-physics
nerd you see, so I used to like to pretend mathematically literate people
were <em>generally</em> smart. But it turns out not to be the case. Domain
specific expertise is a beeaach.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../83_nz_new_management>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../85_tariffman_vs_moslertron>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../83_nz_new_management>"New New Zealand Management"</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../85_tariffman_vs_moslertron>Tariffman vs Moslertron</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
