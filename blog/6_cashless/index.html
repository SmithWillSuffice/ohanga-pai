(an awesome educational and activist group) they have a
library of podcasts on macroeconomics and social issues relevant to our times, loads
of politics and brilliant thinkers. One of them is Brett Scott (a South African,
probably a Bok supporter, but we won&rsquo;t hold that against him aye All Blacks fans).
His wheelhouse is fintec (the horrors of it) and payments systems, particular cash,
and the
<a href=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/war-on-cash/ target=_blank>War on Cash (for readers)</a>
or if you prefer watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE1IiiIV0A" target=_blank>talks here.</a></p><h2 id=control-and-domination><a class=anchor href=#control-and-domination title='Anchor for: Control and Domination.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Control and Domination</h2><p>If you control the payments system you are a little bit like a god. That&rsquo;s not healthy.</p><p>For a more scholarly argument you need to read or listen to Brett. Th gist of the war on cash is threefold, which I&rsquo;ve modulated from Brett&rsquo;s framing by inserting vital MMT knowledge:</p><ol><li>We ought not let private companies gain fees off running the public currency
system, or even small aspects of it.</li><li>Scott does not claim cash should be king and total, but he argues it limits social
inclusion and some privacy if people cannot use cash.</li><li>The war involves banks shutting down ATM and bank branches, making it impossible
for people to even get or move cash through the banking layer. the War involves many
other methods, most people are not even aware, it is a silent war. VISA run active
propaganda for their war on cash &mdash; it is to raise their profits.</li><li>Digital currency forms permit egregious surveillance if there are no regulatory
protections (the software banks use is proprietary and closed source).</li></ol><p>About the War on Cash: it is insidious, and I do buy Brett Scott&rsquo;s argument and
evidence. There is in fact no need at all to have any profit motive in the banking
or payments system. Banking should be boring. Credit risk assessment, payments
clearing, that is it. The government is the monopoly currency issuer, and should
regulate their currency to make people know it is still the currency monopolist (yes,
they still are, you cannot hack the law books so easy my dudes.)</p><p>A few sockcuckers will probably rant that the profit motive is needed to keep the
bankers in line with customers. But this is an old hag-toothed saw of a myth. If you
go back a sec and read what I said narrow banking should be, there is nothing to
compete on: wear a bigger smile? The bank that assesses credit risk more diligently
should never get a profit for it, since that will skew their computations. The worse
credit assessor can make the bigger mortgage loans.</p><p>Customers cannot discipline banks either, since 99% of customers have no clue whether
their bank is close to insolvency or is a deposit risk. Governments can just 100
insure all deposits in their currency unit. The proper discipline on baking
is rather on the assets side, not the liabilities. So the credit assessments need to
be disciplined by logic and mathematics, not profit motive. Luckily plenty of humans
are pretty good at actuarial mathematics, at least good enough, and some are even mad
keen about it they&rsquo;ll work for peanuts to balance a ledger. (those types ted to have
other issues, like ax murdering in their spare time, but bank discipline is not going
to suppress any of that, we have other systems to keep psychopaths in check outside
work hours. Such as making commutes to work unnecessary.)</p><p>((Maybe &ldquo;we the bankers&rdquo; need fully digitised law books too, then we <em>can</em> hack
them, then eliminate government from the money system? Justathought.))</p><p>(((Bankers enjoy so much solidarity it makes any old school lefty puke.)))</p><h2 id=function-not-form-is-the-critical-issue><a class=anchor href=#function-not-form-is-the-critical-issue title='Anchor for: Function, not Form, is the critical issue.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Function, not Form, is the critical issue</h2><p>What I think Brett overlooks is that cash serves a function; it can protect
anonymity, it (used to be) acceptable anywhere;</p><p>My point is an alternative payments system can serve the <em>same functions</em> and do a
better job of it, and that should become the <em>new cash</em>. We aught to just create
such a system, and then call it cash, because functionally that is what it <em>is</em> not
in form, but in abstract essence.</p><p>I would like to hear from anyone who thinks this is not the case and that something unique and essential about physical cash (notes and coins, or even cheques) is missing in something like an open source protected central bank digital currency.</p><p>You have to disabuse yourself of the notion in the USA the FED is a private bank, or
if you still think it is, then we will say Congress scraps the FED (they did create
it) and creates a proper central bank, a branch of government, protected by whatever
democracy you can muster. Maybe even th board of the Central Bank branches are
locally elected. They do not even need to be bankers, the permanetn staff will have
the expertise to run the payments system. They will not be in to selling Treasury
bonds. They will not be permitted to bail out fraudulent private institutions.</p><p>Now a few comments on the above points.</p><h3 id=point-1-----private-money-is-private-control><a class=anchor href=#point-1-----private-money-is-private-control title='Anchor for: Point 1 &mdash; private money is private control.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Point 1 &mdash; private money is private control</h3><p>Although anyone can make money, the problem is getting others to accept it. Well you
cannot do the latter unless by some force, either psychological persuasion (a parent
issues their kids an IOU; or for a very short period a cryptotoken or baseball card)
or directly (a hut tax, or fines and fees).</p><p>If government permit private institutions to emit the public currency units, this is
not good, they are giving a public power over to private interests.</p><p>However, the public currency can be facilitated by private institutions who are
licenced and regulated by the state. The state&rsquo;s burden might be then less, sicne
fewer regulators are employed to regulate than public servants might be to run the
bank. Whether that&rsquo;s a net win for us is a pragmatic calculation. And easy enough to
compute if it&rsquo;s veering too much one way or the other.</p><p>In the USA today far too much private credit creation power exists and there are far
too few regulators protecting the public interest, so that has gone too far away from
a cash system.</p><h3 id=point-2-----cash-remains><a class=anchor href=#point-2-----cash-remains title='Anchor for: Point 2 &mdash; cash remains.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Point 2 &mdash; cash remains</h3><p>I think it would take extreme draconian measures now to protect cash. For one thing, most vendors would need to be forced to accept cash as legal tender.
But it is possible. I doubt Brett Scott can raise that army though.</p><p>Also, and this is more important, I did not find anything in Brett&rsquo;s presentations that is a unique function of cash and cash alone. The fact it is difficult to forge paper or coin is not an essential function that provides any of the protections Brett wants for people. it is the other functions that do: anonymity, no transactions fees,
less power to bankers and fintec, and so forth. But none of these are unique properties of cash.</p><p>SO abstracting away the essential protections, the word <strong><em>cash</em></strong> can be used to describe other types of payments system that there is no war upon. Or we can design one that escapes the war.</p><p>The <a href=https://rohangrey.net/writing/#digital target=_blank>Modern Money Network</a>
central bank
digital wallet is one such system. With a few caveats, that are not hard to satisfy.</p><h3 id=point-3-----the-war-on-cash><a class=anchor href=#point-3-----the-war-on-cash title='Anchor for: Point 3 &mdash; the war on cash.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Point 3 &mdash; the war on cash</h3><p>If we take note of point-2, then it becomes easy to see how to avoid a war on cash. Make cash some form protected easily by our democracy. This is not hard.</p><h3 id=point-4-----srveillance-state-as-bad-as-oligarchy-bankers><a class=anchor href=#point-4-----srveillance-state-as-bad-as-oligarchy-bankers title='Anchor for: Point 4 &mdash; srveillance state as bad as oligarchy bankers.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Point 4 &mdash; srveillance state as bad as oligarchy bankers</h3><p>The way to secure digital cash is with open source software, but I would agitate vociferously for free-libre software for this putative future public payments system. People have to not only own it, they need to feel they collectively own it.</p><p>This means to the point of allowing anyone to submit software patches. (Submitting a patch does not mean it gets accepted.)</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title='Anchor for: Caveats.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>I know what you are going to say, if you live in the UK or USA, which is that (a) you cannot trust your government, and (b) the Congress is too moribund to clear out the cockroaches at the FED and open the US central bank system up to democratic control.</p><p>Well,&mldr; ($^\prime) how about trusting the private firms more? And (b$^\prime$) I think Brett Scott is never going to get his army to win the war on cash, so you&rsquo;d better force your government to protect some payments system that has the same function as cash.
Because you are going to lose paper and coin currency anyway (except for collector
catalogues and historian&rsquo;s museums). If you do not see a CBDW as functionally as good
as cash, you&rsquo;d better look-up
<a href=https://rohangrey.net/writing/#digital target=_blank>Rohan Grey</a>
and the <a href=https://www.modernmoneynetwork.org/ target=_blank>MMN people</a>
to figure out the functional equivalent.</p><p>As a mathematics nerd, I can tell you that is an easy thing to do.</p><p>I got into a one-tweet &ldquo;feud&rdquo; with Rohan about GNU Taler, which provides anonymity
for buyers, but not sellers (by design) and is purely payments method, not itself a
currency (is is just software for frictionless payments with encryption security, and
is open source free licenced, so is better than PayPal).
Rohan blasted me because some categories of workers who sell stuff a few lunatics do
not want them too, need protection, so should also have anonymity protected.</p><p>((I do not think the payments system is the right place to protect workers, but it
might be a necessary last ditch protection in some backwards countries, like the
USA.))</p><p>This ignores the fact GNU Taler can always protect certain categories of sellers too.
You just design it so. It is just software. t is a n existing proof of concept for a
central bank digital wallet. The point is, the technology already
exists for serving most of the functions of cash. My only other point was that GNU
Taler is free-libre software, so any central bank can use it, modify it to suit
public use to protect anyone Rohan Grey wants to protect, and it remains free-libre
(bu the GNU copyleft licence).</p><p>I hope I do not come across as a nasty old grouchy nemesis of Brett Scott&rsquo;s. I do
think the war on cash is real. There are smart ways to win it for the
common people &mdash; which I think is to abstract cash and make it bullet proof
by function.</p><p>Whenever something exists identifiable as a war, it is usually not good for someone in
society, and usually tremendously so-much-winning for some giant fat asshole in a
suit.</p><p><a href=./>Next post (TBD)</a><br><a href=../5_capitalrealism>Previous post (Capitalist Realism)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
