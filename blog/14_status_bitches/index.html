(professes to know some economics).</p><p>I made a few notes, not too many.</p><h2 id=japan-slips-in-gdpper-capita-ranking-----so-what><a class=anchor href=#japan-slips-in-gdpper-capita-ranking-----so-what title='Anchor for: Japan Slips in GDP/Per Capita Ranking &mdash; so what?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Japan Slips in GDP/Per Capita Ranking &mdash; so what?</h2><p>The professor harped on a bit about how Japan had a &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo;. Bill explained
well that it&rsquo;s hard to see in Japan any real loss of output. Their population growth
is stagnant, so their GDP growth rate will not be anything near to say Australia
which has a faster growing population.</p><p>Professor Satoshi Fujii then pulled up (livestream! so kudos!) some data showing
the GDP/N rankings. Japan, he said, had &ldquo;slipped dramatically&rdquo; over the 00&rsquo;s.
Bill (and me) are like,.. &ldquo;big deal, so what?&rdquo;</p><p>This is half-joking, because you know what it&rsquo;s a big deal. Japanese culture suffers
from as much inferiority complex as USA sports culture, they have the be the gdamn
best&mldr; otherwise it&rsquo;s not a real sport. Only the Japanese suffer the inferiority
complex more than others in industrial economics measures. They have a culture of
needing to produce the best products. They&rsquo;ll get miffed if the Germans do something
better. (Not to be stereotyping whole cultures, just telling it like I sometimes see
it.)</p><p>In other words, Satoshi was overstating the &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo; of Japan relative to other nations who are also running neoliberal austerity policies, but he was quite right to claim Japan have irretrievably lost potential output, but not only over the last
decade, over all decades so far.</p><p>I was reminded also of the research by Trill van Treeck on why Keynes&rsquo; vision of a 15
hour work week by 2000 has not been realized. The main reason is the psychology of
conspicuous consumption. People wanting to &ldquo;keep up with the Jones&rsquo;&rdquo;. You can also
call it The Rat Race.</p><p>Worrying about <em>relative</em> status is a b*tch. Note how sociologist van Treeck
explains why Keynes&rsquo; vision of a 15 hour work week is possible but has not
actualized here:

The wealthy nations caught Veblenitis, aka affluenza, aka ratraceitis.</p><h3 id=is-the-another-minksy-moment-brewing><a class=anchor href=#is-the-another-minksy-moment-brewing title='Anchor for: Is the Another Minksy Moment Brewing?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Is the Another Minksy Moment Brewing?</h3><p>This is hard to answer. In the USA circa January 2023, the GOP party holding power want
to vote to not raise the Congress &ldquo;debt ceiling&rdquo; &mdash; the stupidest notion in macroeconomics ever. (They still think their government is using other people&rsquo;s money.)</p><p>Bill Mitchell pushed back on this a bit. He claims central bankers have understood
how to avoid a purely financial crisis (one that does not begin in the real economy,
so not with war, famine, plague or whathaveyou).
They know how to prevent another Great Depression (they proved this in 2008) and
they probably have learned how to stop another Great recession (2008).
The issue in 2008 was the central bank bailed out Wall Street, not Main Street.</p><p>There is no guarantee next time a Minksy upwards instability occurs the central
bankers will bail out Main Street, but they at least have learned bank bail-outs do
not cause inflation. Confidence in the banking system is thus probably only a day
away these days, and hence probably forever after.</p><p>This squares with Warren Mosler less pessimistic comments in a
<a href=https://www.mmtconference.eu/livestream-tuesday/ target=_blank>forum on eurozone pessimism</a>
in a panel at the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9wU5VWGUQ" target=_blank>2nd European MMT Conference</a>
.
The specific segment where Mosler talks about the slow reluctant progression of the EU towards supporting member nations is at about the
<a href="https://youtu.be/oz9wU5VWGUQ?t=2375" target=_blank>40 minute mark</a>
,
and then he pretty much repeats around
<a href="https://youtu.be/oz9wU5VWGUQ?t=2885" target=_blank>48 minutes in</a>
.
The EU is &ldquo;almost already there&rdquo; with nascent MMT awareness, even if it (a) took a
crisis, and (b) they still do not admit MMT is the reality, and (c) they still have
not got the progressive buffer of labour, the Job Guarantee. The EU has &ldquo;backed in
to the &lsquo;right&rsquo; answer, through a serious of crises&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>The risk of rapidly rising household debt levels is thus no longer purely Minsky, but
is an investment risk, not a system-wide risk. In the next Minksy fragile period it
will likely be the case a lot of asset prices will tumble, but they&rsquo;re also likely
not going to drop too precipitously, only the assets that are truly &ldquo;junk&rdquo; will go to
zero.</p><p>The lesson for investors is simple: do not take the risk on junk assets. Avoid the
ponzi schemes, and avoid even the speculative assets. Trade safe, and wait out a
recession.</p><p>For the DougBot project we aim to get a feel for when a recession is about to be
triggered. If the central banks obey the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahm_Rule target=_blank>Sahm Rule</a>
then nothing too bad is going to
happen. At least not until the <em>real</em> economy hits a brick wall, like water, soil,
fossil fuel, or fisheries depletion.</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;too bad&rdquo; is of course relative. The tragic thing is low income
households have &ldquo;bad&rdquo; happening all the time, needlessly, through no fault of their
own, due to government austerity policy. Why needless? They&rsquo;re not the one causing
any inflation.</p><p><a href=../15_media_funding>Next post (Media Funding)</a><br><a href=../13_1_mab3_4_civilwar>Previous post (Money and Banking L-4 Civil War)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
