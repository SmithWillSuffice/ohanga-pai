caved-in today. Man was I pissed. I mean, the basic thesis is ok, even
interesting, probably mostly true, but when Yanis starts talking about
government debt as a bad thing I loose my sh$\ast$t.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll spare the details and just link to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xfFgFqEyfk" target=_blank>talk here</a>
.</p><p>My comments:</p><blockquote><p>@35:00 someone did not read much history. State debt has never caused a
collapse of empire. A State&rsquo;s deficit is it&rsquo;s citizens surplus by accounting
identity, it is a good thing (all else equal). What happens in empire collapse
is either massive corruption or with monetary systems something like massive
private debt, which means if the State is in deficit some oligarchs are
holding an enormous amount of currency (equal to the private household debt
plus the government deficit). These are only scorepoints though as far as the
State is concerned, but the banking systems tend to be pretty rigid (by law),
and if private debts of the poor, especially farmers, are not forgiven then
you get revolt, you also get economic collapse. But it is not because of the
debt of the sate (which is private surplus) it is because too much of that
currency outstanding, not yet used to pay taxes, is held by too few who are
hoarding and not spending.<br>     It is gross inequality which is the instability,
not the debt of the State. A state that issues it&rsquo;s own scorepoints is never
broke and can always pay its debts &mdash; in its own currency. (Cesar could have
stamped the trillion aureus coin &mdash; the metal value of the coin is not the
face value. State currency has always been a scorekeeping system.) There is
then inflation risk, but that never causes the collapse of a state, since you
only get nominal currency inflation if you have a booming economy, or have
something crippling supply like a famine, drought or war reparations imposed.
It is surprising Yanis is using monetarist understanding, he has friendly
MMT colleagues, but seems to not have learned much from them.</p></blockquote><p>Then he talked about the trade imablance:</p><blockquote><p>@38:00 that is such bs. Australia has a sovereign currency and can run
deficits too. You send away uranium and import smartphones and Teslas&mldr; if
you are smart. The government deficit is irrelevant (except in political
psychology), it is an <em>ex post</em> accounting identity, and the bigger it is
the wealthier your people, or if foreigners are holding more AUD then the
more customers Aussie firms will have to sell to without the customer doing
a forex swap. Yanis seems to be an imbecile when it comes to state currency
operations. The reason the USA gets away with a huge current account deficit
is because foreigners are stupid and have an insatiable desire for holding USD.
But is the desire for the amount of AUD held also insatiable? Sure it is, you
cannot give me enough of your AUD. If I hold your AUD I am not causing any
price inflation of AUD goods either. Give me a trillion AUD, I can still use
more. If I rashly spend it all in a blitz I&rsquo;m only harming my interest in you
guys keeping your prices low.<br>     I like Yanis, but he can be such an idiot. It
harms the working class to perpetuate the Deficit Myth, it kills the poor.
It emboldens the wealthy &ldquo;tax payer&rdquo; &mdash; who is not the entity funding the
government. As Yanis just said before, it&rsquo;s the other way around (9 out or
10 Musk/Bezos/Gates scorepoints cam from the government). What he neglected
to say is the other 1 in 10 also came from the government, via bank credit:
all banks issuing credit are chartered and licensed by the State. The
government is the source of all state currency, anything else is counterfeit.</p></blockquote><p>A follow-up:</p><blockquote><p>What he really means is the dynamic of superimperialism. Michael Hudson
explains this much better. The USA has learned, even though they do not
comprehend why, that government deficits do not matter. What matters is the
<strong><em>real terms of trade</em></strong> &mdash; exports are your <em><em>real</em></em> cost, imports a real
benefit. If you can get a foreigner to send you Mercedes cars in return for
scorepoints at a FED bank, you are the winner. The USA just learned this before
most others, and yet their politicians, including Kissinger, still do not
understand why it works, and think it is this thing called &ldquo;global reserve
currency&rdquo; &mdash; which is a meaningless concept. With a state currency on a
floating exchange rate bank reserves are for payments clearing, they do not
fund anything. And Treasury bonds are an interest rate maintenance operation,
not a funding operation, or in other words
<strong><em>basic income but only for people who already have money in proportion to how much money they already have.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>On the technofeudalism thesis I only had one comment:</p><blockquote><p>@16:00 at this point I do not know if Yanis will get around to it, but I&rsquo;d
also hypothesize techno-feudalism eats itself. You cannot stop tinkerers and
hackers from removing those chips from the Tesla, or subverting Amazon, or
establishing pirate communications, &c. Hackers need some time to do this,
also freedom from prosecution, but eventually they will do it (whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo;
is) if it becomes legal and is &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;based&rdquo;. (Ironically Apple Inc
through Wozniak demonstrated this a little, until Apple became greedy under
S. Jobs.)</p></blockquote><h2 id=write-to-me><a class=anchor href=#write-to-me title='Anchor for: Write to Me!.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Write to Me!</h2><p>I do not enjoy writing critically of people like Varoufakis, Steve Keen or
