What I&rsquo;m really
going to do is indulge in some reviews of a bit of Twitter banter. Unfortunately
for the sake of time and limited resources (MMT joke, but serious) I&rsquo;ll
probably have to stick to giving some hot takes, but here at least I get to write
more at length than in a tweet.</p><p>I do have a serious purpose though. If you ever get into a public or private
discourse where someone seems genuinely engaged but just seems to fail to grok MMT,
and might be starting to get hostile, I hope to be able to give you some tips on how
to both diffuse hostility and educate.</p><p>I offer no guarantees. My pedagogy credentials are pretty middle-of-the-road.
But I hope you find this post useful. If you have better ideas please let me know.</p><p>A key principle of good education is that it has to be <em>two-way</em>.</p><ol><li>So don&rsquo;t teach MMT <strong><em>at</em></strong> people. Try learning <strong><em>with</em></strong> them.</li><li>It is superior for learning to first understand where the other person is at,and
accept you might be wrong. (How many times have my mathematics students said
something correct that I miss-heard and then started going off in the wrong problem
solving direction myself! Too many times to count on my fingers!)</li></ol><p>I realize TwiXxer is <em>by design</em> not much good for learning <em>with</em> people.</p><h2 id=background><a class=anchor href=#background title='Anchor for: Background.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Background</h2><p>MMT gets a lot of friendly fire. But these are often the hardest bullets to handle.
It&rsquo;s the friends you don&rsquo;t need who often cause more heartache than the enemies
you might desire. Here are some threads of both frenemy and enemy fire I might try
to address.</p><p>Forgive me for naming names, it&rsquo;s unavoidable for finding these conversations (if
that&rsquo;s what we can call them) on Twixxer.</p><ol><li><strong>Mob Burphy</strong> &mdash; Austrian School christian economist who purports to genuinely
want to understand MMT &mdash; in order to destroy MMT. We will find maybe he is one
of our best allies! If we take Bob to heart as a respectable Christian, I think we can go a long way. MMT, to my mind, is very &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo;${}^\ast$.</li><li><strong>Rullen Coche</strong> &mdash; an investor who purports to understand MMT, but quite often
attacks MMT, and when he attacks he seems to be straw-manning. Less an ally, because when you straw-man a position you are attacking it is really toxic and destructive to
healthy debate and learning. I say this knowing I might not be capable of
representing Roche correctly, so I will set up a straw-man &ldquo;Rullen Coche&rdquo; and
attack that entity. That&rsquo;s the honest way to straw-man. Consider the argument, not
the person. So I <strong><em>cannot say</em></strong> I am criticising Mr Roche.</li><li><strong>Michard Rurphy</strong>* &mdash; a tax accounting expert in the UK. Very friendly
with MMT. But he is so obsessed with tax justice he at times misses the point.
Still an ally because I think for now the banter between Tax Justice UK and MMT&rsquo;ers
is still friendly, and seeking unity.</li></ol><p>${}^\ast$ Catholic means: &ldquo;<em>Of broad or liberal scope; comprehensive.</em>&rdquo; But
of course I&rsquo;m using a double-meaning! To me MMT is also a source of The Good.
Not &ldquo;of all good&rdquo; of course, are you crazy. But whatever is a source of good is
true religion. (Ok, so there is a lot of false religion around! <em>Most</em> religion is
false, in the precise case it is not a source of Good (Aristotelian meaning).)
In this case <em>the Good</em> is the spiritual aspect of knowledge and wisdom: MMT
is <em>that</em> in macroeconomics.</p><p>To avoid persons, I would characterize each of these three frenemies in
ideological
terms as:</p><ol><li><strong>Austrian School Objections to MMT</strong> &mdash; these often boil down to,
&ldquo;ok, MMT is correct, but we do not like the system.&rdquo; This is probably a
stretch! But I&rsquo;m going to take it. Bob Murphy gets close to this at times,
then seems to go astray.</li><li><strong>Post-Keynesian Critique</strong> &mdash; MMT was born from post-Keynesian study, so
absorbed all of PK economics. The PK&rsquo;ers however seem to like to think they are
still special. So they often object to MMT, but fail to appreciate MMT agrees with
most things post-Keynesians would argue, in the case of currency pegs or fixed
exchange rate regimes. Rullen Coche seems to however have a more distorted
view, which we will take a look at.</li><li><strong>Tax Justice Objections to MMT</strong> &mdash; might be an over-simplification, but
I&rsquo;m going to go with <em>these folks accept MMT</em>, but they just <strong><em>hate & loath</em></strong>
Warren Mosler&rsquo;s framing that taxation is a coercive force that drives the currency.</li></ol><p>With this all now in mind as background, I&rsquo;ll repeat I&rsquo;m an amateur in educational
psychology, but have a lot of practical experience (if I were a great teacher I&rsquo;d
say I was more than an amateur) and a journeyman in pedagogy expertise. So take my
advice with a grain of salt, and definitely drop me a message if you have anything
to improve upon or add, that&rsquo;d be nice of you.</p><p>I will just say, please respect my naïve optimism about human beings. I know it
is naïve, but I still think I am correct. To get my highly non-naïve
background you&rsquo;d have to talk to me for a lot longer. It&rsquo;s only apparent
naïveté because I don&rsquo;t permit myself the time to expound at greater length.</p><h2 id=the-austrian-catholics><a class=anchor href=#the-austrian-catholics title='Anchor for: The Austrian Catholics.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Austrian Catholics</h2><h3 id=mmt-is-too-much-government><a class=anchor href=#mmt-is-too-much-government title='Anchor for: MMT is Too Much Government.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>MMT is Too Much Government</h3><p>There are so many layers to this one, I really wish I had a libertarian friend
to put my axe to the grindstone on this one.</p><p>Here are some discussion points:</p><ul><li>MMT is a recognition the currency is a simple public monopoly. This allows us
to, as a democracy, choose the size of government we want. Abstracting the
population and citizenry like this is a highly macro move, so beware of the nuance
(democracy is tyranny of the majority, and so forth, which have obvious defeater
counterarguments&mdash; what&rsquo;s the better alternative?)</li><li>We do not in fact have democratic governance anywhere in the world in any major
nation. Voting, alone, is not democracy. So the &ldquo;right size of government&rdquo; for a
given culture is a complex thing that probably no country can perfect. But with
the MMT lens we at least get a chance to understand the proper real constraints
on the bit of democracy we actually have.</li><li>MMT also empowers a citizenry to better fight for the democracy we want. You
have to know your demands, and know they are realizable, not utopian. MMT gives
you this in spades. <strong><em>Real resource limits.</em></strong></li></ul><h3 id=money-from-mars><a class=anchor href=#money-from-mars title='Anchor for: Money from Mars.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Money from Mars</h3><p>A weird attack on MMT I confess to not fully understanding (because it is so
lame I&rsquo;ve never bothered to interrogate the folks making these arguments fully)
is based on the (false) idea we need some real commodity to settle debt
obligations</p><p>So &mdash; the Austrian argument seems to go &mdash; governments cannot just settle
accounts in their IOU, because that is immoral somehow. They&rsquo;d better promise to
deliver the gold, the &ldquo;real stuff&rdquo;.</p><p>This is utterly lame. It misses the whole point of MMT that the currency is an
IOU, has always been an IOU, and never is anything else, not in all 6000 years of
recorded monetary history.</p><p>A government can peg to gold, or to pizza or chicken wings or potato crisps,
but&mldr; why?</p><p>There is no good reason on Earth to peg a tax credit to any commodity. The &ldquo;hard
money&rdquo; thinkers simply have never grasped what MMT is saying here.</p><p>Their ultimate retort is just &ldquo;Well&mldr; it is immoral!&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s a subjective judgement, not a critique of MMT.</p><p><strong>The MMT Response</strong> &mdash; it is certainly not immoral for an authority to
impose tax liabilities, provided it also issues the means to fully pay the
tax liabilities without causing <em>residual</em> unemployment. (Also, one might
hope, without using bullsh1t or soul-destroying jobs to offer as ways to earn
a tax credit. There is zero need to use bullsh1t jobs! So it&rsquo;d be another
horrific policy mistake.)</p><p>It is not a legitimate attack on MMT to point out there is unemployment.
The MMT response in this case is simple: unemployment (people seeking to
exchange their labour for tax credits) is a policy mistake. A job guarantee
is one way to amend this horrific mistake.</p><p>If society at large democratically does not wish a big government footprint,
they can lower the tax liabilities.</p><p>However, as Warren Mosler rightly points out, there is hysteresis. If
government has in the past caused needless unemployment, this damages people
spiritually, physically, psychologically, and private firms regrettably (but
understandably) do not like hiring the long term unemployed. So it is a moral
responsibility of government to hire all the unemployed their tax liability
generated. Either with expanded public sector employment, or a local community
run job guarantee (government does not get to dictate the JG work).</p><h2 id=the-post-keynesians><a class=anchor href=#the-post-keynesians title='Anchor for: The Post-Keynesians.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Post-Keynesians</h2><h3 id=mmt-is-the-job-guarantee-----nothing-more><a class=anchor href=#mmt-is-the-job-guarantee-----nothing-more title='Anchor for: &ldquo;MMT is the Job Guarantee &mdash; nothing more&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>&ldquo;MMT is the Job Guarantee &mdash; nothing more&rdquo;?</h3><p>This is merely a subjective opinion. The school of thought now known as MMT
has blossomed beyond Warren Mosler and Bill Mitchell&rsquo;s original insights.
But even the OG&rsquo;s were not just doing &ldquo;a JG and nothing more.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>No other economics school of thought begins with the currency being a
simple public monopoly.</li><li>MMT favours ZIRP &mdash; few other economics schools are proposing ZIRP, and fewer
recognizer zero interest rate policy tends to be disinflationary. But whether
this is &ldquo;new to MMT&rdquo; is debateable. But why debate? MMT activists should not be
out to win a sports contest here. If other economists agree with ZIRP, then great.
MMT is not alone!</li><li>Same with a JG. Keynes inherently recognized the superiority of
full employment over price stability. But did not explicitly mention the
buffer mechanism.</li><li>Also considered unique to MMT is the important point that central banks
are not, and cannot (operationally) be separate nor independent from government.
If nothing else, if only the CB has a mandate to control interest rates, they must
coordinate with the Treasury. One critical MMT insight was that the sale of
Central Bank bonds is the same as Treasury bonds &mdash; neither are funding
operations, both are interest rate maintenance operations. No other school of
economics acknowledges this, and yet it is critical for well-informed policy
decisions.</li></ul><p>It is funny that characters like Rullen Coche try to assert MMT is nothing
new, or not a big deal, because it just re-packages existing knowledge. But
let&rsquo;s consider all the above. I think you will find the school of thought
now known as MMT is so drastically distinct from any other mainstream and
heterodox economics, that to accuse MMT of being nothing significant is
highly disingenuous, or ignorant.</p><p>Also, if other economists are happy to accept the MMT positions, and call it
their own, I&rsquo;m not going to complain. As Richard Feynman often pointed out in
the context of science: the names and labels of things are not what truly matter.</p><p>MMT is objectively a <em>superset</em> of post-Keynesian economics, so if a
post-Keynesian comes along claiming MMT adds nothing new to their analysis
why are they attacking MMT? Is that not some sort of mental autoimmune
deficiency response disorder? If they&rsquo;re just saying MMT <em>is</em> PK, then fine,
but then we&rsquo;re pointlessly quibbling over labels, which I want no part of,
let them have the MMT insights.</p><p>Yet high profile post-Keynesians (which I assume we can take to be a not
unfair representation of PK thought) have written full blown articles
attacking MMT proper, so I find the post-Keynesian absorption of MMT to be
simply false, objectively.</p><h4 id=a-currency-monopoly><a class=anchor href=#a-currency-monopoly title='Anchor for: A currency monopoly.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A currency monopoly</h4><p>I should not need to expand on this too much. Legally and institutionally this
is not a debate point.</p><p>The critique of MMT might be that nations do not act <em>as if</em> the currency is a
monopoly. But that&rsquo;s no fault of MMT! It&rsquo;s the opposite. MMT is trying to tell
people what the case is, and if policy is not crafted with the legal reality in
mind then needlessly awful boneheaded policy may result. (Foremost being
needless austerity.)</p><h4 id=zirp><a class=anchor href=#zirp title='Anchor for: ZIRP.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>ZIRP</h4><p>Advocating ZIRP is not a unique MMT position, but understanding why it
works is (I beleive)!</p><p>On a floating exchange rate, with a non-convertible currency, the natural
rate of interest is zero.</p><p>Not so on a fixed exchange rate, gold peg, or other arrangement. While MMT&rsquo;ers would love other economists to acknowledge this, they do not, so this is a clear difference, and could be considered another distinguishing aspect of MMT analysis.</p><h4 id=the-jg-its-also-about-de-commodifying-labour><a class=anchor href=#the-jg-its-also-about-de-commodifying-labour title='Anchor for: The JG: It&rsquo;s also about De-commodifying Labour.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The JG: It&rsquo;s also about De-commodifying Labour</h4><p>A good response to more Marxist leaning economists, is to point out that not
only is a JG a superior macroeconomic stabiliser (they might not give a fig) it
<em>also</em> is crucial for de-commodifying labour in any monetary economy (which
includes capitalism, socialism or any hybrid mixed system of political economy
where a state monetary system is in use.)</p><p>I think it is simply a no-brainer. Human beings are spiritual beings, living
in a material condition. Any moral economy should not commodify the workers.</p><p>The only political economies with any inherent justice elevate the workers
to the most precious resources. But if the economy is monetary this needs to
be recognized. A job guarantee does this in part. Expanding skilled public
sector work &ldquo;for anyone who wants it&rdquo; is another complimentary part,
separate to a JG.</p><p>The JG is a provisioning for people who cannot find private sector
employment, but desire private sector employment.</p><p>The JG is <em>also</em> a buffer mechanism for price stability &mdash; an important
function for purely psychological reasons: because for whatever dumb reason,
most normies (and even marxists) seem to hate inflation more than unemployment,
which is stupid, but it is what is is.</p><h3 id=and-the-jg-cannot-work-in-most-countries><a class=anchor href=#and-the-jg-cannot-work-in-most-countries title='Anchor for: &ldquo;&mldr;and the JG cannot work in most countries&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>&ldquo;&mldr;and the JG cannot work in most countries&rdquo;?</h3><p>This one is just false. Even a vastly scaled-down JG-lite has worked in two of
the most corrupt nations around, Argentina and India.</p><p>In my mind the JG works because it is,</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> Locally administered. It&rsquo;s not a top-down approach to full employment.<br><strong>(b)</strong> The local nature of a well-designed JG program leverages human decency.
It uses the correct approach to moral economics &mdash; which is roughly that outlined
by Samuel Bowles, among others (the gist of which is that Adam Smith was only half-
right. Moral economy is paramount, but governments cannot enforce morality or
motivate moral behaviour by taking the moral decision off people. It never works
well that way.).</p><p>Another way of putting it (simplistically) might be that the Law, the justice
system, is for enforcing social norms. Not for legislating morals.</p><p>Rullen Coche has seemingly a technical economic objection to how a JG can
work. He is wrong. But the best way (not the only way) to see that is through
the moral economy lens.</p><p>Unemployment is a far more severe economic problem than inflation.</p><p>Besides: the JG acts counter-cyclically, and so it appears Rullen Coche does
not quite understand this. It&rsquo;s hard to say without interrogating Mr Coche
directly. but since he is a straw-man I&rsquo;m going to say that is the source of
his misconception.</p><h4 id=central-bank-operations><a class=anchor href=#central-bank-operations title='Anchor for: Central Bank Operations.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Central Bank Operations</h4><p>In the USA the CB/TSY operations are a little peculiar. By Law (so an MMT
point conceded!) the TSY is not permitted to put scorepoints in USD onto
their balance sheet at the FED banks, in particular the TGA account from
which government makes the mark-ups and mark-downs to spend, and
receipt tax returns, respectively.
This shenanigans regrettably promotes the myth of FED independence, which
is a sham. That is probably by design, though the fiendishness of it is
hard to pin-point, to be generous let&rsquo;s call it an ignorant fraud)</p><p>The TSY skirts around this congressionally self-imposed constraint on the
consolidated government by auctioning Treasuries. Primary dealers bid.
Treasury swaps the bonds for reserves, and fills up the TGA account, then can
&ldquo;spend&rdquo; the &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; money, only is cannot have been borrowed. Where did the
primary dealers get USD <em>ultimately</em> from in the first place?
They can only come from past government issue, or credit from another bank.
(Banks cannot lend to themselves, it is illegal.)</p><p>To avoid the overnight cash rate tending to zero the TSY must thus first
supply the reserves for the primary dealers to purchase the bonds with in
the auction. They accomplish this with the reverse repo facility (RRP).
That is: Primary dealers contract to purchase the bonds in the future
(the next day often) in exchange for the bank reserves. The TSY in effect
has purchased this promissory note.</p><p>If instead the FED issues TSY bonds (reserve drain), or buys them
(reserve add), the economic effect is
exactly the same. Since in the RRP arrangement TSY can guarantee the TGA
account is in positive balance (as technically required before government
spending can legally take place) the issue of bonds is not the funding
operation it is thought to be. It is rather precisely the same as the effect
of the FED issuing bonds &mdash; which is that it drains reserves.
When government spends there is an offsetting reserve add. Which means
there is no pressure on the interbank interest rate.</p><p>Thus we see the purpose is to maintain a desired interest rate floor.</p><p>This could also simply be set to zero, in which case there is no need at all
to have the RRP facility and no need for either agency of government to issue
interest earning instruments, aka. TSY bonds.</p><h4 id=zirp-means-the-debt-ceiling-fear-politics-can-go-away><a class=anchor href=#zirp-means-the-debt-ceiling-fear-politics-can-go-away title='Anchor for: ZIRP means the Debt Ceiling Fear politics can Go Away.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>ZIRP means the Debt Ceiling Fear politics can Go Away</h4><p>The fear and dread over the &ldquo;government debt&rdquo; is about the promise to pay
interest on the bonds and redeem the coupon. MMT will tell you this is never
a problem operationally, because it is just whipping out a computer keyboard
and marking up bank accounts, and debiting TSY accounts, no grandkids or Chinese
financiers involved, no tax payers involved.</p><p>Although MMT tells you this, the superior thing to note is that there is not
need for the government on a floating exchange rate to issue bonds in the
first place.</p><p>So adopting a ZIRP policy makes the &ldquo;national debt&rdquo; disappear. Without
debiting bank reserves or deposits.</p><p>In fact from starting point today, retiring all the TSY debt and going to
ZIRP policy, will eventually add to reserves, and after the maturation of all
outstanding bonds that&rsquo;ll be it &mdash; no more basic income from then on
that was only for people who already have money in proportion to how much
money they have.</p><p><strong>Caveat:</strong> in true MMT style, I count all outstanding cash, coins and bank
deposits as &ldquo;government debt,&rdquo; because government makes the promise to redeem
all those currency forms for payment of tax liabilities. The promise to
redeem is technically a debt obligation. Of course it is trivial for a
government to accept back its own currency. So it is not a &ldquo;debt <em>burden</em>.&rdquo;
But linguistically, semantically, it still counts as a debt <em>obligation</em>.</p><h4 id=negative-tga-balances><a class=anchor href=#negative-tga-balances title='Anchor for: Negative TGA Balances.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Negative TGA Balances</h4><p>There is a final nuance here that I was not aware of until recently, which
is that the TSY TGA account in fact does <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>have</em> to be positive.
Government can still credit accounts to purchase and hire. The rules require
a positive TGA account balance. However, there is policy or
<em>operational guidance</em> for Treasury and FED officials in the event the
spending is immediately needed when the TGA account is zero. The instruction
is to, &ldquo;enter a negative number in the TGA account.&rdquo;</p><p>Which is the MMT point! The currency is not a commodity, it is an IOU.
A negative account balance is precisely mere scorekeeping &mdash; albeit with
economic consequences and severe penalties for fraud, which is why
a clerk cannot just arbitrarily enter negative numbers in the TGA when
marking up private back accounts. They need votes from Congress for the
spending.</p><h2 id=endogenous-money><a class=anchor href=#endogenous-money title='Anchor for: Endogenous Money.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Endogenous Money</h2><p>Rullen Coche seems to believe (faith based reasoning?) the governments are
using bank money, all the time.</p><p>I think he falls for the PK mirage here.</p><p>Randall Wray goes through the endogenous money and circuitist theories in his

. If you pay attention to them you cannot come
away believing in MCT or endogenous money. Those theories fail.</p><p>There is an exogenous monopoly net currency supplier, and their currency is
the tax credit.</p><p>Once you conceive of state currency as a tax credit (which has other emergent
functions in the markets too) then you cannot take pure endogenous currency
theory separately.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>It is because the final settlement of obligations has to involve a trusted
third party IOU. A bank cannot use its own IOU to settle its own debt.</p><p>In all nations on Earth today (every nation, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe
one exception somewhere?) the trusted final means of settlement is the
central bank. In the case of Ecuador who employ the USD, their final means
of settlement is the US FED! Their central bank. Go figure.
Crazy Ecuadorian officialdom.</p><p>The central bank is in all nations today a branch of
the government, it is not an independent beast.
Libertarians never tire of arguing against MMT on this score, but let&rsquo;s say
they are merely wanting to be right, but deep down know they are wrong?</p><p>Why is MMT right about the myth of central bank independence being a false myth?</p><p>It is because the IOU of the banks are denominated in the state currency units.</p><p>Any physicist who knows about measurement standards (the field of metrology)
knows what I mean by this. The authority tells you what the unit is, you may
use your own IOU units, but all banks everywhere today use the state currency
units, not their own units.</p><p>Good examples to illustrate the counterpoint are systems of money where they
do not use the state currency unit. We have a few of these running successfully

Michard Rurphy does too, as does Mob Burphy. So all three typical attacks on MMT
by otherwise &ldquo;friendlies&rdquo; get this wrong. (I know Mob Burphy is an avowed enemy
of MMT, but he just doesn&rsquo;t realise he is one of the biggest allies of MMT, he has
done more than most people to educate virgin MMT advocates. So to my mind he is a
weird friendly.)</p><p>Rullen Coche is the more interesting one perhaps.</p><p>The idea is that taxation pulls real resources out of the private sector into the
government sector. True. But here we are talking about <em>real</em> resources, not
currency.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take it in steps:</p><ol><li>First government imposes tax liabilities.</li><li>Then people are unemployed, they need to exchange their labour or goods to
get the tax credit (otherwise they&rsquo;ll be going in debt to a bank, or stealing,
or counterfeiting).</li><li>Government can hire the labour or purchase the goods, because now people need
the tax credit, so they will take it.</li><li>That has moved real resources from the private sector into the public
sector. It has also &ldquo;moved&rdquo; currency from the government into the private
sector. (There is no <em>motion</em> of the currency, it is just credits and debits.)</li><li>Taxes are then paid, &ldquo;moving&rdquo; currency back to the government (a redemption
operation, not a funding operation &mdash; the real funding in real resources has
already been accomplished).</li><li>The currency not yet used to pay taxes remains in the economy as net
financial savings of the private sector (in nominal terms, not real savings).</li></ol><p>Can it be so simple that the post-Keynesians simply have not got the sequence
right? I think so. It is a simple mistake.

in fact that tax is simply not coercive. I think their reasoning is that you
get to choose what society to live in. But that&rsquo;s baloney. I never had much
of a choice, and if I immigrate somewhere it&rsquo;ll still be in a nation using
a tax driven currency.</p><p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2724108" target=_blank>Christine Desan writes</a>
some interesting stuff on the legal aspects
of the design of tax systems, implying there is room for nuance in the wording,
and to say, &ldquo;tax coercively drives demand for the otherwise worthless currency,&rdquo;
is perhaps too harsh. However, it is still as accurate as can be for a
short one-sentence sort of length account of state currency.</p><p>I addressed the semantics earlier. It boils down to what you mean by &ldquo;coercive&rdquo;.
If people are not happy about paying a tax, then a tax driven currency is
coercive. If people are happy to pay taxes, and government issues the tax credit
so they can pay, then you do not need to call this coercive. But it is still the
case that tax drives demand for the otherwise worthless currency.</p><p>Which means the currency token itself never needs to be intrinsically
valuable. Which is a massive costs savings to the real economy. It just needs
to be hard to reasonably forge or counterfeit, which human civilization has
managed to accomplish again at minimal real cost.</p><p>If there are any residual tax justice people making objections at
this stage, they&rsquo;re Austrian School retards, probably, who think it is
somehow spiritually immoral to use a currency that has no intrinsic value.
They&rsquo;ve completely missed the whole point of desiring small footprint
government!</p><p>If your stupid democracy forces your government onto a gold standard, well&mldr;
