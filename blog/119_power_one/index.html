several more, but let&rsquo;s not name drop) will know of how the
US deep state is a misnomer. There is a state within a state, just as
Angleton&rsquo;s CIA within the CIA. But it is global in span. The US empire is
global. The USA is a convenient geographic hub because it is the ideal place
to run organized crime and criminal sub-government enterprises.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got a message though for good honest people in government positions,
which is; do not feel you are complicit, speak out, whistle blow, don&rsquo;t shy
away from exposing the corruption in the system you are a part of, and do not
fear for losing your salary. I&rsquo;d cite
<a href=https://sibeledmonds.com/ target=_blank>Sibel Edwards</a>
as a good exemplar, she
only spent about one year in the FBI before realizing she had to whistleblow.</p><p>Although Edmonds and Aaron have a lot of content behind paywalls, those with
the means aught to support them because they trickle out a bit of free tier
content for us plebs, and it is good stuff to know. At least be aware about.</p><p>((Huge Boooo! <em>otherwise</em> to paywalled websites. I mean,
what are you doing guys? Asking us to pay for honest reportage. I&rsquo;ll donate
more than most people would fro their income to such Indie reporting, but I
refuse to go via a paywall like Patreon, who are taking a gross cut of the
donations. Always conduct due diligence on the payments platform. I believe
KoFi is ok, and a few others, make sure you are not accidentally donating
to corporate fascists=ic outfits. This is also why I specifically ask
readers <em>not</em> to subscribe to my substack, stay of the free tier, you won&rsquo;t
miss anything form me.&rsquo;))</p><h2 id=anti-government-government><a class=anchor href=#anti-government-government title='Anchor for: Anti-government Government.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Anti-government Government</h2><p>This is a potential utter mess of a topic, so I&rsquo;ll try to minimize the
keystrokes to get the point across.</p><ul><li>We need government (not for survival or anything, but just for a
civil society). We do not need corrupt government.</li><li>We should desire democracy. we have never had a democracy.</li><li>We need to be anti-<em>that</em>-government, and we need to be
pro-<em>this</em>-government. (You get the drift of what <code>_this_</code>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>that</em>&rsquo;
mean I trust&mldr;. it will be government that holds the JEE and organized
crime bosses to account in one way or another, if ever they are held to
account. It will not be our consumer boycotts.)</li><li>Refugees and victims of ethnic cleansing did need <strong><em>the resources</em></strong>
provided by USAID. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM" target=_blank>the world did not need USAID</a>
.</li><li>Government must do big fiscal. Government must be frugal about <em>real resources</em>.
But that means fully employing available sustainable resources. But not in a
wage-slavery manner.</li><li>THE CIA within the CIA has not been government supported. The CIA within
the CIA does not get Congressional appropriations, which is why those
particular darker covert operations need you to be a drug user, a boozer, and
a sex addict. Angleton&rsquo;s branch of government has to use drug, pr0n, booze,
prostitution (aka. &ldquo;hospitality&rdquo;), gambling and sex trafficking to get funded.
That branch of government <em>is</em>
&ldquo;tax payer funded.&rdquo; The only branch that really is.</li><li>Stop funding that branch of government. It&rsquo;s a better reason to stop using
drugs or gambling etc than anything Topper Gore ever said.</li><li>Having noted all that, US Congress is enabling fascism through Its
neoliberalism, so even the good folks in Congress and parliaments around the
world are not speaking out enough, and arre far too naïve. Guys and gals in
the seats, it&rsquo;s ok to lift-up rocks now and again to see what is underneath.
The criminal enterprises are not boogeymen when you expose them to the sunlight.</li><li>On a darker note, if you are an honest person desiring to enter into
government, I think you have to be completely unafraid to get assassinated.
At least in the USA and other kleptocratic nations (Saudi Arabia, The EU,
Turkey, Nigeria, and so on, it&rsquo;s a long list).</li></ul><p>We could go deeper. BDS these days means much more than boycotting known
Israeli businesses and their ties, since the network of the CIA&ndash;Mossad&ndash;Mafia
worldwide crime syndicate (a &ldquo;network&rdquo; really, since it&rsquo;s a mess of inside
blackmailing and grift against the grifters against the grifters). You get
the picture.</p><p>Odds are you are still indirectly funding <em>with your actual tax dollars</em> some
zionist project or another. I might even be doing so myself when I purchase my
coffee beans? But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I <em>know about</em> the company behind the beans
is part of the worldwide crime racket and then continue buying those beans.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a huge waste of time to just skim some consumer products and
realize you should boycott them. Start with Micro$oft and Apple Inc. products,
I would say, and do not give Spotify, Joe Rogan, or anyone else in that space
your cash, and do not even give them advertising revenue by clicking on them
for &ldquo;free&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re owning your eye-balls you realize. The entire Pop Music
industry is another one to boycott. It&rsquo;s not going to make you life more
miserable to not support pop music and Marvel movies.</p><p>If you wish to &ldquo;break the law&rdquo; to boycott but still &ldquo;consume&rdquo; the content
then pirate website might be a valid way to go about it, but you have to
realize they still in effect are owning your eye-balls, since the propaganda
is deep in these corporate entertainment complex layers. I&rsquo;d just advise get
other hobbies, like theoretical physics, rock climbing or gardening.</p><p>Giving up hope on civil society is not the answer. But you do get some
elements of nihilism and doomerism in Aaron Good&rsquo;s podcasts. It&rsquo;s forgiveable.
It is remarkable though when Aaron does offer a positive outlook, precisely
because he&rsquo;s one of those researchers who has gone deep into the near
bottomless pit of corruption and organized crime that is part of much of
the world wide system of government. I am pretty sure it touches the UN as
well. TO emerge from such research without going full nihilist is a testament
to Aaron&rsquo;s good character. That&rsquo;s why I can listen to some of his more
outrageous claims without getting too skeptical. Conspiracy theories are
always a little dubious because they are conspiracy theories, but not all
theories are wrong.</p><p>However, regarding things like the JFK assassination, or really the
assassination of the good four (JFK, MLK, Malcom X, RFK) &mdash; it&rsquo;s distraction
I reckon. There have been far more important figures assassinated. I do not
even know where to begin, but some names that drop into my head without
an internet search would be Mossadegh, Nassar, Sankara, Allende, &mldr; that&rsquo;s not
even to mention those not yet assassinated, like Dilma-Rousseff, who was
&ldquo;generous&rdquo; enough to not believe the US/CIA was behind her impeachment.</p><p>I think the point is, they did not have to be. The worldwide organized
government-mafia crime network does not always need the CIA. So it is
immaterial whether the CIA was behind the Brazilian lawfare. Those material
realities do matter when people can be held to account, but the work the
pro-worker peace-camp has ahead is far harder than just getting a few
foot-soldiers for global zionist-fascism-plutocracy on The Hague chopping
blocks and whatnot.</p><p>(This reminds me of one of Aaron&rsquo;s positive comments, which is that a
worldwide peace & reconciliation process is needed for all the neocons and
neoliberals, since the crimes have surpassed those of apartheid South Africa,
so we are far beyond jail cell punishments by now.)</p><p>The global Tory-conservative reich-wing empires are always fully prepared to
sacrifice foot soldiers. JEE the most recent &ldquo;in the news.&rdquo;</p><p>But even if i drew up a full list of all the peace-leaders, it&rsquo;d be nothing
but a list. The names do not matter. Which is not to say erasing the names
from history is good, it&rsquo;s not good, but it is to say far more unnamed people
have been the real power behind these courageous spokespeople for The People.
When a Sanakara or an Allende gets killed, millions of ordinary people have
been killed. Because their hope has been dashed. Their spirits weakened, which
is the worse thing. Which is precisely why we simply cannot afford to place
our trust and hope in the big name leaders. They are only temporary
spokespeople, always, nothing more.</p><p>The best thing about Jeremy Corbyn (2016 version), was not Corbyn, it was
the idea of enabling worker cooperatives.</p><h2 id=the-polyarchy><a class=anchor href=#the-polyarchy title='Anchor for: The Polyarchy.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Polyarchy</h2><p>One thing I wanted to get off my chest todya is MMT related, and concerns
USAID, and I am grateful to Aaron Good and his guest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM" target=_blank>Ben Thomason</a>
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM" target=_blank>The Devil’s Chessboard podcat</a>
.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve read and heard far too many liberals attacking DJT and DOGE for
defunding USAID.</p><p>Wanna know my take?</p><p>GOod damn riddance to USAID.</p><p>The USA is not a world saviour superman. No one anywhere ever needed USAID nor
the National Endowment for Democracy a more anti-democratic institution is
hard to find). This are both highly anti-democratic organizations, promoting
fascist-zionism in the most insidious ways. There are ordinary workers employed
or volunteering for such organizations who are innocent and doing good things.
But it is a total fabricated myth that the US dollar was ever needed for such
efforts, and a total myth they were promoting real democracy.</p><p>(See my previous post on why the US dollar was never a
&ldquo;global reserve currency&rdquo; &mdash; no one has ever needed US$ except the US
tax payer. I&rsquo;ve never handled a US dollar myself, except when working as
a postdoc on an H1B in the USA. What I&rsquo;ve used, probably quite a bit, are
international banking swaplines &mdash; spreadsheet operations which from my end
only <em>ever</em> concern NZ dollars.</p><p>If I&rsquo;d have had a few billion NZD I could have funded everything good that
USAID were supposed to be doing, but minus the propaganda.</p><p>When not overt CIA fronts, these organizations are low-key propagandists
for American capitalist corporate values &mdash; &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; stuff. &ldquo;Being rich
makes you virtuous&rdquo; stuff. &ldquo;Venture philanthropy&rdquo; stuff. &ldquo;Profit make to
do good&rdquo; stuff. Since I cannot devote much time to researching
the topic of how corporatist propaganda spreads through soft neocolonialism,
corporate philanthropy (fake 𝕒𝕗) and all that crud, I am glad to have found
Ben Thomason has done that hard work.</p><p>That interview with ben is where I first heard the term Polyarchy.
That&rsquo;s &ldquo;rule by a whole blend of neocons, neoliberals, zionist-christian,
right-wingnuts, coopted leftist rubes, liberal moralists (anti-moral people),
mafia bosses,union bosses, and all the rest.</p><p>By the way, am I saying it is a <em>)good thing</em> DJT and his cronies shut
down USAID?</p><p>I think so, yes. It&rsquo;s a normie establishment liberal hair-on-fire reaction to
think closing down USAID &ldquo;killed millions.&rdquo; The starving of the real aid
probably did kill millions. But that was not the fault of DJT. Every country
where people were starving and dying from the local genocides and ethnic
cleansings could have easily been avoided by other nations shipping in the
supplies. The US dollar was never needed, and the goods from the USA were
not either, there are plenty of other sources for the supplies that the
refugees needed. IF the USA happens to contribute a substantial fraction,
then great. But it never had to be USAID. The UN would have sufficed. The UN
does not need the US dollar for funding, any currency will suffice.</p><p>New Zealand should just drop a trillion dollar NZD coin in the bank account
of the UN. Then people will have the precious NZD to buy stuff with for the
UN deployment. What are they gonna buy? If it&rsquo;s not for sale in New Zealand
they&rsquo;re going to have to buy from somewhere else. They could always do so
with the NZD. It would not weaken the NZD. The forex lines are not the source
of the NZD price level. What else can I tell you?</p><p>Would this have some re-gauge effects domestically in NZ? Probably. But
so what? It would not limit the NZ government capacity to run domestic full
employment, so would have no bad consequences for the NZ economy. We do not
have to export anything we do not desire to export surplus to our domestic
needs. Not ever. We need foreign oil. So we need to export to &ldquo;pay for&rdquo;
those imports. If our government had the political support from the people
to trillion-dollar coin fund the UN, we could do it. It&rsquo;s always the
political will to spend, not the scorepoint capacity.</p><hr><p>Back to the global mafia-government worldwide empire</p><p>Yeah, so our governments are not a global mafia state network. This is not
the message you should be receiving. Many parts of our governments are part
of a global fascist mafia world state. It&rsquo;s a very messy thing.</p><p>For example; was Bill Clinton compromised? No doubt. Was he a fascist?
Probably not. Was he worse than a fascist since he was captured by
neoliberalism? (A far more insidious cause of mass human suffering.) Yes, I&rsquo;d
say so. I prefer my fascist with their swastika on
their sleeve, preferably their proud forehead.</p><p>The governments have been infected with fascist-zionism-mafiosi, that&rsquo;s just
a fact. This does not make the government inherently corrupt institutions. It
means you aught to be very wary of any government policy that smells a bit
fishy and reeks of the &ldquo;privatization of public services&rdquo; meme, since that&rsquo;s
the stuff that is revealing the infection. That&rsquo;s what needs laser surgery
removal.</p><h3 id=where-to-point-the-laser-beams><a class=anchor href=#where-to-point-the-laser-beams title='Anchor for: Where to point the laser beams?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Where to point the laser beams?</h3><p>Well, I do not think that&rsquo;s a hard question to answer, you only need to do a
tiny bit of research, and often the crooked politicians are just saying the
quiet part out loud. Any &ldquo;user pays&rdquo; or &ldquo;efficiency of the private sector&rdquo;
or &ldquo;we&rsquo;re wastin&rsquo; tax payer dollars&rdquo; rhetoric is self-revealing the cancer that
needs to be zapped.</p><p>And yes, even TYT, Krystal & Kyle, and the Majority Report and all the rest
of the liberal media are part of the rot, they&rsquo;re all about the &ldquo;wastin&rsquo; of
the tax payer dollars.&rdquo; That has to to be zapped. Let me be clear once more:
when you buy your drugs for your partying, <em>you are the tax payer funder.</em>
And that&rsquo;s the <em>only</em> time you are the proverbial &ldquo;tax payer funder&rdquo;.
You are funding the extra-governmental syndicates of criminal global
governance, the non-government government. The tax payer funds the
private sector.</p><p>The whole point is to stop having our governments being run by the
private sector. Because when they are run by the private sector they
are &ldquo;tax payer funded.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the <em>only</em> time &ldquo;government&rdquo; is
tax payer funded.</p><p>The deep state, the particularly criminal branch of it, is in the private
sector. That is whom you are funding when you consume slop, like Coca Cola,
Nestlé, Spotify, Netflix, AppleInc., and all the rest. Have a cut-back on
some of that stuff, is what I&rsquo;d suggest. Its a minimal least effort.</p><p>Does this mean buying a few bananas from the grocery store shipped by some
global fascist mafia-like run fruit-grower worker exploitation corporation
is complicit? No, of course not.
No more so than watching your favourite Marvel movies. But yet there are
things you can live without, and it is a good thing to try to live without
for a while.</p><p>But do we instead say, regarding government terrorism: &ldquo;Ok, it is so infected
now, it just has to be euthanized, the hole lot!&rdquo;</p><p>No. I do not think we are there yet. I guess we coudl get there, but there
are still too many good people in government, they are not the prominent
headline names of curse, but it si a baby & bath water situation, from what
I can tell.</p><p>What is one to do?</p><p>My first answer is to at least not be a dupe, a rube, deliberately ignorant
doomers or boomers (neither!), and educate yourself. Just do what little you
can to fight back.
Best to join a pro-worker pro-justice organization somewhere, one with
good organic leaders, not an unelected hierarchy.
But it cannot be anarchist, it has to be well-organized or you are wasting your effort. (If in doubt, learn this from
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_We_Burn target=_blank>Vincent Bevin (“If We Burn”)</a>
.)
You maybe shouldn&rsquo;t love Bernie, but he was more organic than Obama. Obama
came from a neoliberal lab experiment.</p><p>Sorry, I&rsquo;ve run out of keystrokes.🤣</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../118_mamdemsock>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../118_mamdemsock>MamDemSocks</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
