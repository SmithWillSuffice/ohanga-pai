But the university
topic will go further, because we read in last weeks New Zealand capital city last
surviving newspaper, The Dominion Post, that universities are being starved of
funding, may need to fire thousands f staff, and cut back research. Thousands of
staff is enormous for a small nation like New Zealand, not small fires.</p><h2 id=medical-mushrooms><a class=anchor href=#medical-mushrooms title='Anchor for: Medical Mushrooms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Medical Mushrooms</h2><p>I&rsquo;ll report what I&rsquo;ve heard, aI do not know any of this fr certain first hand.
I will use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qry8K7KPHIQ" target=_blank>Paul Stamets&amp;rsquo; report</a>
. It is
not fully reliable because he is squarely
on the <em>psychedelics are great</em> side of the story. But he seems like a trustworthy
sort of character. He openly talks about the dangers of using psychedelics.</p><p>First thing is the least toxic psilocybin mushrooms have been reported by US FDA
scientists as the least toxic and most beneficial psychedelics they have ever
tested. I will leave it at that for now, because I want to report or opine on the
research and public policy side, not the pure science side.</p><p>I will do this just with a couple of comments I posted on Pual Stamets&rsquo; video clip.
I think this aught to be sufficient for Ōhanga Pai readers, who I presume are here
for the macroeconomics and social justice. Understanding the macroeocnomcis is the
critical thing for emboldening and empowering your activism isf you have a cause.</p><p>One last qualifier on the &ldquo;science&rdquo;: I had ketamine administered once for severe back
pain that hospitalized me (the pain, not the ketamine). It was obviosu to me the
ketamine had potential anti-depressant effects, but it rutned out later ketamine cna
help regrow damaged glutamete receptors in the brian, a major cause of chronic
depression. So that its not a mere palliative, it is a potent active medicine and
curative, far superior to symptom treating drugs like SSRIs and NDRIs.</p><p>Also, from the trip I had, I would not say ketamine is strongly psychedelic, at
least not personally, it is merely psycho-active, personally. It made me talk a lot
about theoretical physics on the way to the hospital in the ambulance. I would not
want to take a stronger dose, and would not need to, I don&rsquo;t ned trips, I know they are
dream-like states, not spiritual experiences. (If you want to redefine the meaning of
spiritual as a mere mental series of surreal inner subjective events, I am not going
to argue, but then we are talking about entirely different phenomena. Please just
respect my usage of the word.)</p><p>Spiritual experiences tend to be very nasty and grotty. You know you&rsquo;ve had a
spiritual experience when you help someone, and probably suffer, but feel euphoric as
a result because you feel you have done some good in the world. The suffering is not
the aim of it though, helping others is the aim.</p><p>Here are two comments I want to share that I left on Paul Stamets&rsquo; talk.</p><ol><li>Stamet&rsquo;s mentions how the placebo effect appears to ruin randomized double blind
control trials (RCTs). But I thought that was nonsense talk.</li></ol><blockquote><p>@35:00 don&rsquo;t be silly Paul. An obvious placebo group is not a reason to drop RCTs.
The data you get is just different. Plus the researcher can still be blind, via an
intermediary data gatherer assistant. Plus, in the first case you are not out to
measure the placebo effect <em>per se</em> since in the real world you want the placebo
effect to be active in any case, if at all possible, if it is a beneficial effect. If
at first we cannot reliably determine the significance of the placebo it does not
matter too much. It means you need to gather more data not less, to tease out the
placebo effect significance. <em>More research, not less</em>.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li>Paul mentions he has a mantra, &ldquo;nature provides, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Which sound sa bit
anti-social to me. If you are going to advocate for use pf psilocybin and supply them,
then how about getting yourself bloody well skilled mate? Have some social
responsibility? Here was my comment:</li></ol><blockquote><p>@37:00 well that&rsquo;s a big f-ing problem. If Stamets, with decades of user
experience, is &ldquo;not skilled&rdquo; how tf do we resource the workers needed to safely
administer psychedelics? Seems to me ketamine is a better way to go at least for
depression, known to act directly on the glutamate receptor damage in people with
chronic depression. (You can fact-check me, I&rsquo;m not an expert.) also, get those
neoliberal and fash bastards out of political office, and institute full employment
and green sustainable working class prosperity, euthanise the rentiers, and you
remove most of the need for &ldquo;cures&rdquo; for depression and anxiety, you reduce the
anxiety, fear, uncertainty and depression of living in the working class. (Learn MMT?
justsayin&rsquo;.) Then you will have the fiscal space to employ the few psychiatric
nurses needed to administer psychedelics for people who truly need them. Treat causes
first, not symptoms.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously I am not trying to shame Stamets here, just a friendly,
&ldquo;what about it, mate?&rdquo; To turn the mirror around: I&rsquo;m not thoroughly skilled in
MMT analysis, but I am constantly learning and have the desire and motivation to do
so precisely to be of public service and not merely &ldquo;let nature provide.&rdquo; You cannot
yet get a degree or certificate in &ldquo;MMT Nursing&rdquo; but I enrol in Bill Mitchell&rsquo;s
university courses and diligently complete the assignment to become a better &ldquo;MMT
Nurse.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m never going to be the best <em>MMT Nurse</em>. But if no others arise in large
numbers, I&rsquo;ll do what I can.</p><p>As for use of psychedelics in medical practise? I am neither for nor against. I do
not think people need to use psychedelics to gain spiritual experiences, clearly.
The psycho-active side-effects of medicines are tolerable in many cases, and are
certainly no good reason to not use them as medicines, if they produce superior
healing effects. If we banned medicines and foods because they have unwanted
side-effects we&rsquo;d have very few legally available medicines and almost nothing
legally available to eat.</p><h2 id=university-research><a class=anchor href=#university-research title='Anchor for: University Research.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>University Research</h2><p>On the points just made: <em>more research not less</em> is what I call for, especially
when the placebo effect is confounded by obvious psychoactive effects.
especially when the &ldquo;tax payer&rdquo; is frikin&rsquo; <strong><em>not funding it</em></strong>. No one&rsquo;s
wallet shrinks when our NZ government employs university researchers. It&rsquo;s the
exact opposite, someones wallet gets thicker, with no inflationary bias &mdash; until
tax is paid.</p><p>Well that means employing more people in university research, not less. That means
employing the administrative staff to clear the paperwork burdens, not unemploying
them.</p><p>But what is neoliberally infested New Zealand doing? F-ing unemploying university
staff. It&rsquo;s Gross, incompetent politics, and disgusting anti-social governance.
The government is supposed to be the preeminent public sand social purpose
institution of all, but the neoliberals run governments as anti-worker and
anti-social institution who by policy choice, no market necessity, serve the wealthy
and the capitalists, who themselves have no problem finding bread to eat and real
estate to speculate upon.</p><p>Honestly. A neoliberal politician today needs psychedelics to cope when they wake up
to reality, to the horrors and injustices they have perpetrated. Anyone who thinks
the government needs to get money of rich people <em>before</em> it can issue the currency.
They&rsquo;re not only ignorant now, but since MMT has become headlines they are disgusting
frauds and willfully ignorant, and that becomes a crime against humanity, and over
time only more of a crime, less of an innocent ignorance.</p><h3 id=poer-of-the-pen-ctivism><a class=anchor href=#poer-of-the-pen-ctivism title='Anchor for: Poer of the Pen ctivism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Poer of the Pen ctivism</h3><p>I know it feels pathetic, but the word <em>is</em> powerful. It&rsquo;s juts you have to use it,
not stay silent. So I wrote an email to the journalist who published the &ldquo;Crisis in
Our Universities&rdquo; headline in the Wellington Dominion Post. It is up to him to
desire to read and enquire into the truth, I&rsquo;ve given him the chance. I re-publish my
email here so other activists can do some Copy & Paste and re-use. Edit for your
purposes, and write to me if you think you can improve such letters to journalists.
I especially like shorter letters that get to the point without being impolite.</p><p>((Journalists, ironically, suffer from attention and reading deficit disorders.
They have very small mental capacity to absorb new knowledge. The gossip
columnists and click-bait writers focus on the spectacle, not enough on the truth.
And let&rsquo;s be honest, 90% of political opinion columns degenerate into gossip, and
are not informing the public of the available policy space options available to
governments.))</p><p>Journalists are supposed to be our mirrors to the world and speakers of truth to
power, but too many journalists remain among the ignorant on matters of
macroeconomics, and that, like the lack of trained psychiatric nurses, is a big
f-ing problem.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say the lack of honest and courageous journalists is the bigger f-ing problem.
Too many of them have libertarian tendencies or have drunk the neoliberal austerity
koolaid. Sometimes this derives from a protestant work ethic, but they&rsquo;ve then got
it all horribly backwards.</p><p>The protestant work ethic, for what good it is, tells you to employ people, not
unemploy them. You do not therefore &ldquo;tighten the belt of government&rdquo;! That&rsquo;s a false
metaphor. The government is the provider of currency &ldquo;bread and water&rdquo;
metaphorically, so needs to issue for public purpose, unconstrained, not withdraw the
sustenance because &ldquo;they will run out of this bread&rdquo;. They cannot run out of NZ
dollars, and are not beholden to bond markets for finance.</p><p>If a useful resource (think willing labour, first and foremost) is not being
employed, government can always employ it, without question, and without driving up
prices, because the unemployed resource bid from the private sector is by definition
zero. The horrific social and lost real output costs of not employing all willing
labour is enormous, exceeding, in the matter of about a decade, the costs of all wars
in all human history.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:35%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:25%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../27_justiceandknowing>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Posts</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../27_justiceandknowing>Justice and Knowing</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
