<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp_nNeSqEW8" target=_blank>India and Global Left</a>
perpetrating macroeconomic myths. This is not good.
However, I am being picky.
Mostly I like listening to Danny&rsquo;s takes on geopolitics. But like a few other
<em>geopolitical webcasts who shall not be named</em>${}^\dagger$ he gets monetary
economics completely backwards sometimes.</p><p>${}^\dagger$But check out the excellent
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK6tOFidLVs" target=_blank>The Burning Archives</a>
</em>.</p><p>Is it too &ldquo;extremist MMT&rdquo; ü§£ to write &ldquo;<em>completely</em> backwards&rdquo; there"?
Probs. But I&rsquo;m going for complete alienation here! It&rsquo;s a Ministry of
Silly Walks Strategy.
The one person with &ldquo;millieeeeeons&rdquo; of dollars and a twisted mind who agrees
with me might give me an annual pittance stipend to continue writing for
their personal weekend pleasure.</p><h2 id=arent-the-myths-stealthy><a class=anchor href=#arent-the-myths-stealthy title='Anchor for: Aren&rsquo;t the Myths Stealthy?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Aren&rsquo;t the Myths Stealthy?</h2><p>Is there a case for the noble &ldquo;White Lie&rdquo; here?${}^\ddagger$</p><p>I think not. I think quite the opposite. An informed electorate is
one which never needs to fight fascism in the street in the first place.
Remember the Weimar lesson. Fascism feeds off many things, but one big
tasty junk food meal for them is public ignorance of macroeconomics.
Thatcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;tax payer funded&rdquo; myth helps them. It is the antithesis of
a leftist noble white Lie. I do not know any leftist noble white lies.</p><p>${}^\ddagger$Holy smoke, can you taste the irony?</p><p>Using the &ldquo;tax payer dollars are funding this&rdquo; myth is
just right-wing, period. It does not mean <em>you <strong>are</strong></em> right-wing. It just
means you are unwittingly enabling their neo-reactionary monarchist ñ®öñ¶ôñ•£ñ¢ß.</p><p>Today it is the petrodollar myth, one of the puny little boys of leftist
myth-making. I guess you could say it does not detract too much from the
main points Danny and the host were making, but I would argue it does!</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because having a good moral geopolitics and macroeconomic justice frame is a
good thing, but it is tragic if you cannot explain to people why US/Western
hegemony and political dominance is based largely on quicksand. It can all
disappear under (without harming any US citizens, except <em>in relative terms</em>
the top One Percent) very rapidly. We are talking maybe even months. But it
would require everyone to understand the monetary systems of
central governments.</p><p>While it helps keep me busy in vain trying to educate people on MMT from
a spiritual point of view, I still do not like the tragedy of it all when
the Left shoot themselves in the head (more on this in a sec.) even if the
bullets are nerf balls.</p><h2 id=the-good-ol-hegemonic-petrodollar><a class=anchor href=#the-good-ol-hegemonic-petrodollar title='Anchor for: The Good Ol&rsquo; Hegemonic Petrodollar.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Good Ol&rsquo; Hegemonic Petrodollar</h2><p>The politics of oil is very frickin&rsquo; bad and nasty, and so important. But
maybe all the more reason why I do not appreciate myths being peddled.
Even when hearts are in the right place.
They distract from the real core rot in geopolitics, which is stuff like
unnecessary crap, pointless energy consumption for the sake of &ldquo;growth&rdquo; for
no particular reason. (The reason given is &ldquo;falling rate of profit&rdquo;
otherwise, which is ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ°.)</p><p>We survive today because of oil. We cannot do without it near-term,
without oil the working class would tomorrow be living in darkness and
starvation. We can stop burning the stuff if the leftiepol engineering
got cracking on building nuclear and geothermal power utilities. But this
cannot remove our modern dependence on oil. We need oil for chemical
feedstocks. Weaning off oil is not simple thing. The politics of oil will
thus still be with us probably long after climate catastrophe is averted, if
it can still be averted. I say ‚Äúprobably‚Äù because there is a good case to
be made that oil politics is so closely associated with climate crisis that
to solve the latter would mean eliminating the nasty stuff about the
former. (I do not mean to incite defeatism here!)</p><p>When the host mentioned the &ldquo;petrodollar&rdquo; I had my say in the comments.
It is perhaps a minor issue but you can judge for yourself the weight of false
psychology. I personally think understanding why the petrodollar is a myth
is an important part of any nation&rsquo;s knowledge bank for avoiding dependency
on the USA.</p><p>I wrote to India and Global Left:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp_nNeSqEW8&t=720s" target=_blank>@12:00</a>
there is no such thing as a petrodollar. Not that it is the worst
myth of normie macroeconomics, but it isn&rsquo;t a good one either. What do you
even mean by the term for a start? We in New Zealand import over half our
oil, we mark-up the exporter&rsquo;s bank account in NZD. They convert to their
currency. Same for anyone. The Saudis desire USD because they do not
understand their own currency and desire extremely low taxes. With bare
minimum taxation they cannot use the riyal for domestic full employment
without incurring inflation risk. So they use the foreigners currency to
get imports etc. without politically intolerable inflation of riyal
denominated prices. But it is just a convoluted way to ensure
decent <em>real terms of trade</em> but with all the overhead false psychology,
which is not good, and miss-fires people&rsquo;s geopolitical neurons.</p></blockquote><p>I continued:<br>It distracts attention of activists from what US hegemony really derives
from. In fact it contributes to aiding US hegemony. If you buy in to the
common rhetoric the US dollar is a &ldquo;global reserve currency&rdquo; and is what
enables the USA to be hegemonic economically, you simply do not understand
reality. The USA needs people to be completely ignorant on the monetary
system. If people understood what the US dollar is, they&rsquo;d not have a bar
of it, and the IMF/WB would be completely defanged ‚Äî without anyone in the
US Congress lifting a finger to help us.</p><p>(I skip many nuances of realpolitik, but that&rsquo;s all a youtube comment
can offer, you need to research this stuff yourself properly and not
regurgitate normie economics myths.)</p><p>I&rsquo;d just say sprinkling around the phrase &ldquo;petrodollars&rdquo; like it means
anything (other than &ldquo;false psychology&rdquo;) is incredibly stupid and shows a
lot of ignorance and laziness which is tragic.</p><p>I added for sarcastic emphasis,</p><blockquote><p>If you can weld steel and erect timber and pour concrete out of USD
scorepoints in a FED TSy account, then yes, you can build beach property
with USD earned from selling oil. No workers or machines in sight,
right? Magical thinking.</p></blockquote><p>I know that&rsquo;s a bit juvenile, but I honestly think sometimes such
obvious things need to be stated, even though the comedic irony score
is low. I am sure I need people to hit me over
the head sometimes too when I stray from my topics of expertise.
((Look: The Barbie movie (2023) was not anti-capitalist. Radiohead are
mathematically provably the greatest artists of all time. I am pretty sure
I am right about the Barbie movie. But I did not see it, so&mldr; not my
expertise. I have no aesthetic expertise in music composition at all, but
I can still mathematically prove the statement about Radiohead.ü§£))</p><h3 id=why-the-falling-rate-of-profit-is-ÍïóÍñπÍùáÍùáÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ°><a class=anchor href=#why-the-falling-rate-of-profit-is-ÍïóÍñπÍùáÍùáÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° title='Anchor for: Why the &ldquo;falling rate of profit&rdquo; is ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ°.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Why the &ldquo;falling rate of profit&rdquo; is ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ°</h3><p>I thought that remark above might trigger some lefties, so I think I
should defend myself. If you focus on profits denominated in the State
unit of account then you are being misdirected. Call it a CIA Op, even
though the CIA do not do a thing for this one. It is an autoleft-psy Op.</p><p>What rapacious capitalism does, and is doing, is causing breakneck
production of a lot of crap, but also rapaciously nice things like
smartphones, villas and golf courses, and also slightly cool but
terrifying things no one ever needs
like trips into low Earth orbits, and whatnot. And it matters not whether
one damn iota of any of this generates monetary profits or not. It is
generating ecological debt, period. Real debt, and the currency has nothing
to do with it. And while the working class do not get their fair share,
we should not want a share in the fruits of rapaciousness. A nice
eco house next-ish to a golf course is good enough, I do not need to
own the golf course, no one should.</p><p>Total ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîóùî∞ (a Gaelic technical word) will use any unit of account for
this, they just do not care. You have to appreciate how workers get
soooo badly exploited it is worse than you can ever imagine.
&ldquo;Not even funny&rdquo; does not even capture it.</p><p>People lack a capacity to comprehend the difference between one million
and one billion, mainly I think because adding three zeroes seems
psychologically like a small step. &ldquo;I can get there too one day with my
bank account!&rdquo; No you can not!</p><p>This is why I gagged recently when
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKrBM7gEz7o" target=_blank>Kim Stanley Robinson</a>
almost seemed to give Bill Gates the &ldquo;autism out&rdquo; excuse. Like being a
nerd excuses the incapacity to realize one is exploiting workers for
one&rsquo;s own gain?
(I&rsquo;d be slightly more ok with the &ldquo;Freud excuse&rdquo; &mdash; his daddy was a
total ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîó, or 90% ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîó, and instilled total ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîó values in young Bill.
Only 90% because the Gates neurons seem to have been trained on data
to realize taxes can be a good thing and not to fund government but because
rich ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîóùî∞ are too damn ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîó-ridden.)</p><h2 id=more-tragedy-from-yanis><a class=anchor href=#more-tragedy-from-yanis title='Anchor for: More Tragedy from Yanis.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>More Tragedy from Yanis</h2><p>Again, I believe I am being thoroughly nit-picky. But I still think a case
can be made that this sort of false information, even though seemingly
innocuous and &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; does the Left harm, needlessly. It&rsquo;s not like
(imagining I am in a position of power and influence ü§£) that I am
demanding a purity test. I just don&rsquo;t want to hear any stupid ñ®öñ¶ôñ•£ñ¢ß from
people I respect and admire.</p><p>You know, because you need to prepare your heroes so when you meet them
they do not disappoint.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/YpR9tRtpz2k?t=190" target=_blank>Hereabouts Yanis does a good take-down of cryptocurrency</a>
and libertarian general nonsense. But right at the end he slips in,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Money can never by anything other than <em>State</em> money.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Doh! ü§¶üèΩ What are you doing Yanis?</p><p>If you want the <em>Extremist MMT Handbook</em> concept of &ldquo;money&rdquo; (which is
the One true concept), it is:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Money</em> is everywhere and always an I.O.U of the issuer.</p></blockquote><p>By <em>this definition</em> Yanis was fibbing.</p><p>However, for those experiencing a bit of cognitive dissonance, Yanis is
not wrong in practical terms for <em>geopolitics</em>. At the geopolitical level we
are talking the <em>only</em> currencies of any importance are State currencies.
The rest of what Yanis said was true, but I would have said it in much
stronger terms &mdash; because I <em>can</em> &mdash; Yanis cannot, since he is dim.
I can say,</p><blockquote><p>Crypto is not even currency!</p></blockquote><p>What <em>is</em> crypto. It can be many things to many people, but <em>essentially</em>
crypto is a certificate for solving a completely useless hard math puzzle.</p><p>All the rest &mdash; ponzi scheme; means for rich ‚Ñ≠ùîòùîëùîóùî∞ to siphon money off
suckers; means for a few lucky ÍïóÍóáÍï∑Íñ°Íóáêù•ÍïíÍï∑ to delusionally think they can get
rich quick and actually luckily do; a black marketeers dream token; a drug
dealers way to avoid needing a Caymans Island bank account number; a way of
accelerating climate change;&mldr; are all also true to some or varying degrees
on a case-by-case basis. Where is any of the <em>liberation</em> in any of this?</p><p>Also, damn it! It really frickin&rsquo; annoys me when lefties laud
&ldquo;The Blockchain&rdquo; &mdash; as Varoufakis does. I cannot say politely how stupid
that is. The Blockchain is not an awesome algorithm nor fantastic pinnacle
of 20th century ledger software engineering, it would not rank among the
top 1000 most useful algorithms. It is anti-human.</p><p>Anything good you can do with Blockchain ledgers you can do far better,
with better outcomes, with more decent incentives, by trusting people and
in turn being honest. It is not rocket science or deep mathematics. (Although
trustworthiness and honesty cannot even be mathematicized, so are deeper
than deep mathematics, but the point is, it comes to human beings naturally
without great effort when we are not living in precarity.)</p><h3 id=apologies><a class=anchor href=#apologies title='Anchor for: Apologies.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Apologies</h3><p>I have lost the energy to expand on the thesis that getting small
little things wrong about monetary systems is actually a frickin&rsquo; huge
deal, and is leftism shooting itself in the brain. It is not (yet) leftists
shooting ourselves in the heart. I understand <em>that</em>, and that might be
a good place to finish today.</p><p>Things in Left spaces could get to the heartless place though, and I worry
a lot about this. Once you give up on realism and start imagining magical
revolution in your head, and imagining your utopia is the only good one,
and imagining money does not matter, you can get to heartless places. Part
of the spiritual condition is valuing wisdom over raw knowledge. The
knowledge is however still needed, it is wise to acquire knowledge. It is
then in a real sense heartless to try to foment revolution without wisdom
about what <em>you and your army</em> are going to do about <strong>records of
social obligations</strong>.</p><p>(Think I am making too much of this? <em>Extremist MMT Handbook</em> dude!ü§£ Get

anthropologists and weirdo dirtbags like myself). Such ignorance is one
