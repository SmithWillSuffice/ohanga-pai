I recently wrote about
platonism (healthy for thinking) versus platonification (deadly for thinking, and for
general living). I think that reference sentence just gave you a summary, so no need
to feel compelled to read it, it is however background to this current blog post.</p><p>(BTW: I have more to write about the last topic, <a href=../20_outputchasm>the Output Chasm</a>
, but it is a heavy topic, so took a break from it.))</p><h2 id=a-very-short-account-of-some-macro-platonifications><a class=anchor href=#a-very-short-account-of-some-macro-platonifications title='Anchor for: A (very short) Account of Some macro Platonifications.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A (very short) Account of Some macro Platonifications</h2><p>It is more fun to spot them yourself. So have a go. I&rsquo;ll just get off my chest a
couple I recently spotted, but starting with the most obvious old one or two.</p><h3 id=neoclassical-platonification><a class=anchor href=#neoclassical-platonification title='Anchor for: Neoclassical platonification.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Neoclassical platonification</h3><p>I think we come across a lot of platonification (miss-use or abuse of platonic
thinking) in macroeconomics. Most MMT aware people, or anyone following Steve Keen
or other heterodox economists, will recognize Neoclassical economics as one giant
platonification (with some scattered remnants of legitimate platonic thought).</p><p>The main platonifications being the idea &ldquo;currency is a veil over barter,&rdquo; and all
the consequences of perfect markets and rational agents, or the modern incantations
of efficient markets, or the more nuanced almost opposite platonification of
&ldquo;zero knowledge agents&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticky prices&rdquo;. Orthodox macroeconomics is a topsy-turvy
world &mdash; mostly because it has no anchor in reality, just some vague platonic ideals
that are very difficult to identify in the real world. In fact, they just are not
found in the real world, except in the heads of fake economists (the olde book taught
variety).</p><p>Because of this topsy-turviness we can simultaneously have orthodox economics schools
talking about efficient markets (as an idealization of market clearing equilibria)
as well as zero knowledge agents (a markets game theory idealization).</p><h3 id=marxist-platonifications><a class=anchor href=#marxist-platonifications title='Anchor for: Marxist platonifications.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Marxist platonifications</h3><p>Some of the (perhaps unfair) critics of <em>marxisms</em> point out modern marxists have
bastardized Marx and come close to treating marxism as a religion (with a few
competing sects).</p><p>I think that is unfair framing, but there is some truth in the zealousness. MMT
writers, and others (Steve Keen, foremost) have been pointing out for a long time
that Marxists have the monetary system all backwards, and are closer to
neoclassicals.
They still think in terms of a gold standard or (roughly equivalently) fixed exchange
rate regimes. These are inapplicable today for many nations, and those nations still
operating fixed exchange rates or commodity pegs, are dong so by government choice,
not out of any platonic need to treat the state&rsquo;s tax credit platonically as a real
substance.</p><p>It&rsquo;s accounting records folks: the government currency has been, and will always be
(probably) a tax credit. One reason is parsimony: an MMT system is a very simple
system, low cost, and democratic and equitable provided your government is democratic
and equitable (can&rsquo;t ask for much more!).</p><p>I agree modern marxists bastardize Marx. People point out how British economist Joan
Robinson criticized modern &ldquo;Keynesians&rdquo; as being bastardized Keynesians (so in fact
anti-Keynes). The same criticism could be levelled at many (not all) modern
marxists. One thing Marx emphasized as a philosopher was that followers should not
stay consistent to the original philosophical project. They should adapt and change
according to the needs of the time and to changes in society.</p><p>Well, we&rsquo;ve had radical changes sice Marx&rsquo;s da. for one thing governments are far
bigger in size, as percent of investments. Governments have always been currency and
legal fiat monopolists in some respects, and as oligarch influence over governments
dwindles they become all the more so (a happy thing if you can get it).</p><p>This means monetary operations no longer even appear t operate like a gold stndard.
So almost all of Marx&rsquo;s derivations based on commodity currency are worng. I am sure
he&rsquo;d want his followers to update.</p><p>One drastic consequence is that the Falling Rate of Profit is no longer derivable.
This is even if we ignore Steve Keen&rsquo;s criticism that the labour theory of value is
mechanically false.</p><p>The simple reason for the former is that governments are monopoly issues of
non-convertible currencies, so can always bail out any capitalist whose profit rate
plummeted. It&rsquo;s a political choice, our governments make such choices from time to
time.
They could also choose instead to bail out the consumers, but hardly ever do, for no
good reason other than false consciousness of the economic impacts. (Talk to an
MMT&rsquo;er about this &mdash; you want to bail our people who do, or organize, productive
work, not the rentiers.)</p><p>The simple reason for the latter (fallacy of the LTV) is that energy is a major input
into production, and we et most of our energy for free from Nature. The labour
involved in transforming the Sun&rsquo;s energy and fertility of soil, is near
insignificant to the gain we get from industry. This is both in terms of raw energy
as well as the numeraire for pricing energy production (the tax credit). So free
exergy form the soil and Sun is the main source of surplus value.</p><p>What Marx got correct was that Labour is the only socially exploited source of
surplus value &mdash; but that&rsquo;s in monetary pricing terms, not energy terms. It takes
very little energy to create a billion tax credits. In fact it takes about 60 watts I
imagine. You don&rsquo;t mine fiat currency out of the ground like gold.</p><h3 id=trader-bro-platonifications><a class=anchor href=#trader-bro-platonifications title='Anchor for: Trader Bro platonifications.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Trader Bro platonifications</h3><p>Here I gleefully confess one inspiration for this post was Nassim Taleb (NNT). He
likes to write about how foolish platonistic thinking is, and yet indulges in it
himself, in some measure.</p><p>The thing is, as I wrote over on the
<a href=https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/blog/18_plates_and_socks/ target=_blank>physics blog</a>
,
platonism is essnetial!
(That&rsquo;s a joke, but also serious.)</p><p>Some things should be essentialized. But if you essentialize concepts that have
no essence then that&rsquo;s false and possibly dangerous thinking which I call
platonification (platonizing the non-essential).</p><p>The Natural Numbers, perfect circles, Pythagorean triples, vector spaces, the
transcendentals like $\pi$, are all platonic essences. They refer to no things in the
physical world. We have to use platonic thinking in mathematics, if not we lose a
lot of expressive power and textbooks can multiply in tedious length in vain efforts to
avoid mathematical platonism.</p><p>Things like nations, race, intelligence (IQ) are non-essential concepts, and should never be considered platonic, and we get horrors when people try to platonify these notions.</p><p>OK, but what about NNT and the Trader Bros?</p><p>Well, I think they platonify a lot of monetary concepts. NNT seems to be aware
government cannot be forced to default in obligation in their own currency. But he
has been sucked into the &ldquo;tax payer funded&rdquo; mythology, which is a form of
platonification of the purpose of taxation. it&rsquo;s a libertarian Austrian School
platonification. It is pretty darn evil.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve grown a bit weary, so might add more example slater. But will finish for now by referencing an excellent article on <a href=https://jamesarobichaux.substack.com/p/the-tax-to-spend-myth-fuels-hatred target=_blank>James Robichaux's Substack</a>
pages where he writes about the Tax Payer Funded mythology. It&rsquo;s good.</p><h2 id=guarding-against-platonification-on-mmt><a class=anchor href=#guarding-against-platonification-on-mmt title='Anchor for: Guarding Against Platonification on MMT.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Guarding Against Platonification on MMT</h2><p>Honestly, I do not come across to much platonification in MMT. Warren Mosler often
uses the <em>MMT Base Case for Analysis</em> but that&rsquo;s admitting no country is using the base
case (Job guarantee, permanent zero interest rate, non-convertible fiat currency,
exchange rate float), so it&rsquo;s not a platonificaiton. It is just decent platonism.
A &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario.</p><p>When people start talking about more specific policy measures, like forms the Job
Guarantee can take, then ideology creeps in, which is always a platonification risk. So
how to avoid those risks?</p><p>One way is to keep an open mind. Your conception of the Job Guarantee might not be
entirely compatible with someone else&rsquo;s. Say a libertarian&rsquo;s JG conception versus a
socialist&rsquo;s JG. So allow for the gap between conceptions, and do not make a little
difference be an obstacle to a greater good.</p><p><a href=./>Next chapter (TBD)</a><br><a href=../20_outputchasm>Previous chapter (The Output Chasm)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
