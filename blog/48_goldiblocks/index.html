Michael Hudson. I appreciated. Actually it was only a reaction video to an interview with Hudson,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePds45e5JXU" target=_blank>“Michael Hudson Actually Caused All This!”</a></p><p>However, Hudson often makes me cringe. He is MMT aware, and friendly-ish,
but not a proper MMT expert. This makes for sound cringebites worth
commenting upon briefly.</p><p>I just wanted to get a few things off my chest with these latest cringebites.</p><h2 id=there-was-no-gold-standard><a class=anchor href=#there-was-no-gold-standard title='Anchor for: There was No Gold Standard.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>There was No Gold Standard</h2><p>OK, there was a period of gold standard, but you need to appreciate the
pretence that is was. Apart from commodity traders looking to make a buck aprasitcally, or jewelers, or electrocnics folks, few people needed gold, and so never redeemed currency for gold. When you have a omnetary system where people are not redeeming for gold in any meaningful way, you do not have a gold standard.</p><p>But you can still call it a Gold Standard era if there is a legal prmiose to redeem for gold. I&rsquo;ll give you that, but that is all.</p><p>So I can unashamedly post this sport of comment,</p><blockquote><p>@5:00 that is a myth. It was not truly a gold standard. It was thought to
be. But few states ever redeemed currency for gold, and the paper claims on
gold reserves regularly exceeded the total gold supply at Fort Knox or
wherever, I believe by several times over, so this is <em><em>not</em></em> a gold standard,
it was a political pretense at such to impose worker austerity, and applicable
as policy by justification because of fixed exchange rate regimes (which are
entirely unnecessary self-imposed constraints, more austerity).<br>      Moving to floating exchange rates meant
the pretense was officially over, but the gold standard had been gone well
before that move. Yet gold standard mindsets prevail in the form of fixed
exchange rate <em>mentality</em>, which is inapplicable today, but the policies
designed for fixed exchange rates (aka. fiscal austerity and interest
rate/inflation targeting) remain, entirely unnecessarily. The correct and
<em>only necessary target</em> on a floating exchange rate is full employment, and
secondarily (but important for economic justice, if this is what we desire)
fair distribution (i.e., euthanize the rentiers).</p></blockquote><h2 id=out-cucking-the-radical-academics><a class=anchor href=#out-cucking-the-radical-academics title='Anchor for: Out-cucking the Radical Academics.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Out-cucking the Radical Academics</h2><p>The dude doing the reaction vdo also made some remark about how activist or
&ldquo;radical&rdquo; academics often do work that gets egregiously co-opted by finance
capital. You know the Thomas Franks story &mdash; right-wing fake-populists
co-opt the language of true leftipol populists. That sort of thing, on larger
scales.</p><p>The right-wingers are even far superior at using leftist populist memes and
language. They cloak it in the Slitherin veil of prosperity gospel shyte,
and the like. Pretty disgusting. (&ldquo;Youz get what youz dezoyves!&rdquo;)</p><p>Felt I had to stick up for the shitty science profession which amorally
allows finance capital to run all over the tech fruits of science,</p><blockquote><p>@3:50 it is far more acute a problem in science, my field. Finance capital
will seek to make a buck off workers by any means possible, and high tech
advances under the systemic forces prevailing only accelerate that fleecing of
the working class, and increase evisceration of the precariat. The USA is the
most prosperous nation on Earth, and <em><em>also</em></em> one of the the most unequal, so
has some of the worst austerity atrocities, and this is <em>by no fault</em> of the
employed as individuals.<br>      You have to understand the source of
unemployment. It is not the private sector. It is the government, the State
creates all unemployment by design, it&rsquo;s called fiscal austerity: they never
issue enough currency to meet the non-government sectors needs to pay taxes
and satisfy net savings desires, the result is mal-distribution, the top One
Percent can pay taxes and save, the bottom 90 Percent cannot possibly, by
simple accounting identity, they go into bank debt in order to pay taxes and
live paycheck to paycheck.</p></blockquote><p>Scientists are typically far better cucks and enablers of capital pigs than
radical academics.</p><p>Although, you know&mldr; you have to hand it to Hudson for being the dumbest
person alive who ever wrote about Superimperialism. If you or I had
discovered the basics of superimperialism would we have been working for
the Neocons at the Hudson Institute? ((Hudson is no dummy, but is one of
the few who wrote about Superimperialism. So he is simultaneously one of
the smartest and one of the dumbest to have written on Superimperialism.))</p><p>I know, I know, Michael tells us he was an infiltrator. Ok dude.</p><p>To be fair, he has spoken up on all this, so he has become an infiltrator I
guess. It is just a very weird trajectory. First enable the Necons, along
with Reagan, Cheney and Rumsfeld, then tell folks how you did that, and
that you were all along fighting against injustice?</p><h2 id=health-is-not-healthcare><a class=anchor href=#health-is-not-healthcare title='Anchor for: Health is Not Healthcare.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Health is Not Healthcare</h2><p>I grabbed the bit about the USA being simultaneously the greatest
and the worst on Earth from
<a href=https://stephenbezruchka.com/ target=_blank>Dr Stephen Bezruchka</a>
(author of &ldquo;<em>Inequality Kills Us All</em>&rdquo;), and his interview on
<a href=https://realprogressives.org/podcast_episode/episode-253-death-by-inequality-with-stephen-bezruchka/0 target=_blank>Real Progressives here</a>
.
Check it out, it is good.</p><p>If you have good health then you do not need healthcare. A good cognitive
dissonance talking point to keep in mind.</p><p>OK, but how does one gain good health? Do we not need a good public
healthcare system? Bezruchka argues, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>Or rather, yes we do desire a good healthcare system, but the best
healthcare system is one with the fewest people needing it. How does that happen?</p><p>Bezruchka explains that politics is the first health provider, not the
healthcare stuff (hospitals and the like). If we have decent politics, proper
democracy, equality, full non-bs employment, economic justice, then the
demands upon the healthcare system reduce dramatically, and people are
generally far healthier, just form good politics.</p><p>Those who say, &ldquo;Oh, well that&rsquo;s all well and good, but out politics is
stuffed, so there is no hope!&rdquo; are neoliberal enablers, and should be sent
to Gulag comrade.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:25%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../47_bondeconbro>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../47_bondeconbro>Bond Econ Bro</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
