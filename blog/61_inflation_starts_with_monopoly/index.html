<a href=https://dougaldlamont.substack.com/p/this-one-chart-destroys-conservative target=_blank>Lamont here</a>
and <a href=https://bondeconomics.substack.com/p/comments-on-asset-prices-and-inflation target=_blank>Romanchuk here</a>
.</p></blockquote><p>Steve Keen also had one <a href="https://profstevekeen.substack.com/p/what-about-prices?publication_id=872467&post_id=143129900" target=_blank>here: “What About Prices?”</a>
.</p><p>I asked the mmt group:</p><blockquote><p>Lamont writes about a chart showing Canada oil
price history: &ldquo;What it illustrates, in very clear terms, is that inflation of
oil prices &mdash; which drive consumer inflation &mdash; are due to conflicts and
political events&mldr;&rdquo;<br>     Question for the mmt googlegroup: is it a fair
critique if I reply to Lamont pointing out there is also a monopolist (OPEC+)
setting price? It begs the question how influential &ldquo;politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;conflict&rdquo;
are, and which direction causality goes. Major war in the Donbas or
Middle East can certainly impact supply, but the monopolist is still the price
setter, right? So it is really down to how political and conflict events
disturb the leisure of the oil monopolist. (That&rsquo;d be my challenge for
inflationistas. Is the oil monopoly going to continue raising price? But
then are central banks going to think they need to raise rates to &ldquo;fight the
inflation&rdquo; [cough!]? Leading to sustained inflation!!!)
Regards to all.</p></blockquote><h3 id=fresh-shot-o-mosler><a class=anchor href=#fresh-shot-o-mosler title='Anchor for: Fresh shot o&rsquo; Mosler.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Fresh shot o&rsquo; Mosler</h3><p>As is almost typical, Warren chimed in with a one-liner.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve called it duelling monopolies. The currency monopolist vs the oil
monopolist.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>OK, so maybe not fresh Mosler, but it was fresh for me, since i had not
heard &ldquo;duelling monopolies&rdquo; before in the context of inflation discussions.</p><p>It is another one of those macroeconomics points that really <em>only</em> an MMT
expert will comprehend. It is &ldquo;highly macro&rdquo;. It is recognition the source
of the price level is with the monopolist.</p><p>If there is no monopolist then something else is governing the price level,
whatever anchor or lack of anchor that may be. However, the MMT historians
point is that since the dawn of monetary systems (records of credits and
debits, held in people&rsquo;s heads or collective memory, or clay tablets, or these
days computer records) there has <em>always</em> been a currency monopoly.</p><p>You cannot find single currency regions outside of systems of mere bank
clearing, like the Banco del Giro, that are absent a currency monopolist.
Whether they <em>know</em> they are the source of the price level or not is an
interesting and highly relevant question for social equity. But operationally
there is no denying almost all currencies since inception have had a monopoly
issuer.</p><p>Since the oil supply these days is not the currency monopolist, and energy is
the driver of all non-financialized${}^\ast$ real economies,</p><p>${}^\ast$OK, nerds. Financialized economies do run on fast computers for
those parasitic traders. The point is, we do not need financialization. It is
an obscene parasitic layer, completely unnecessary.</p><h2 id=mosler-round-2><a class=anchor href=#mosler-round-2 title='Anchor for: Mosler Round 2.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Mosler Round 2</h2><p>The next day Warren followed up with another succinct email concerning the
response a nation has to a foreign monopoly setting oil prices.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;To continue, with the duelling monopolies/price setters, when the Saudis
raise prices, our choices include, for example:<br>   1. Allow the relative price of oil and products that contain
oil to rise accordingly, while all other prices remain the same. This would be
a reduction in our real terms of trade and diminish our real wealth
accordingly, and the reverse for the Saudis. And it&rsquo;s what they would
prefer &mdash; get more for their oil in real terms.<br>   2. Allow our entire price level to shift up accordingly such
that real terms of trade remain as before. There would be no shift in real
wealth.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Can we say, to trigger the Boomers, <em>only MMT understands</em> how to do this
non-disruptively and equitably. The government should have a wage floor, called
a Job Guarantee, and this can be used to one-time adjust the price level,
whenever necessary, according to policy option 2.</p><p>A pragmatist would probably suggest a few other ways to upwards adjust the
price level, transfer payments, pensions, and public servant wage rates, for
example. Note that there is no inherent &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; here. The public servant
wages are not competing with the JG wage. Nor really are private sector wages.
Once the government currency injection goes up, and the JG goes up, if people
drop out of low paid work to choose the JG, the private firms can upwards
adjust their compensation to workers, to keep them hired.</p><p>The government fiscal injection provides the funds for firms to make higher
sales, so their prices can be marked-up too. But then they&rsquo;ll have to retain
employees. So this should all have the <em>intended</em> effect of a one-time
upwards adjustment in the price level.</p><p>This is the design intent of the policy, so private sector employees also get
a trickle up in wage rise. If they do not, then it is not a big deal. There is
no need for the government to press private firms to increase their wages.
The government protection for workers is the Job Guarantee, and enforcement
of labour standards.</p><h2 id=mmt-comprehension><a class=anchor href=#mmt-comprehension title='Anchor for: MMT Comprehension.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>MMT Comprehension</h2><p>Here is the way to understand these matters.</p><p>The government, from inception, first issues the currency. It functions as a
tax credit.</p><p><strong>The Purpose</strong> &mdash; is that the government <em>needs to provision the public sector</em>.
But in <em>real terms</em> not nominal (currency) terms.</p><p>Explain it this way to your friends. This way you do not cause moral panic
excitations in the fibre of their whole being when you say taxes and bond sales
do not finance government spending.</p><p>The tax liability (not the tax receipt) creates a demand for the currency,
and sociologically an insatiable demand, this allows the government to hire
real resources. Why? Because the government just created millions of people
who want to accept the currency in exchange for their goods or labour. There
does not even need to be any bank in existence except a scoreboard at one
central bank. And there were no &ldquo;tax payers&rdquo; before the government imposed
the tax liabilities.</p><p>Taxes <em>do</em> &ldquo;fund&rdquo; the government &mdash; indirectly but by design in <em>real</em>
terms, not monetary terms.
Finding the money is never a problem, except politically and psychologically.
Why is it a psychological problem? Because the idiots in charge (however well
educated, MENSA level IQ, and worldly knowledgeable) do not understand the
monetary operations. So tell them! They are capable of understanding if they
want to understand.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../60_wealth_maldistribution>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../62_n-body_problems>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../60_wealth_maldistribution>Gold Maldistribution</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../62_n-body_problems>N-body Problems</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
