on a recent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5OLxWhtGgQ" target=_blank>Macro and Cheese podcast</a>
episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5OLxWhtGgQ" target=_blank>#308</a>
.
I’ll say this is not pendantry. Once you start trying to be friends with
dumb-dumb marxists by saying a State currency can be a commodity, or has
ever been a commodity, you feed the right-wing trolls who want to return to
a gold standard. Which is not gold currency, it is a currency peg. Big
difference. Let’s not even feed these trolls.</p><p>Although Bill doesn&rsquo;t know me from Adam, I am Internet pals with Grumbine
and appreciate his efforts at Real Progressive more than any other podcast
or public education platform in the world. So there&rsquo;s that. If I fire at
them it is intended as constructive criticism. I am not even angry with Bill.
Just depressed.</p><p>I also <strong><em>fully realize</em></strong> in the court of leftiepol public opinion I am
probably the bad guy here. No one wants to know the state currency is a
simple public monopoly and has never in all history been a
&ldquo;commodity currency&rdquo;. No one on the marxist left wants to know the K. Marx
analysis of “falling rate of profit” is a myth. Although, one Socialist
youtuber got it right, in agreement, when I pointed this out: The real
falling rate of profit is simply ecological pressure. So yeah, Capitalism
eventually leads to declining rate of growth of profit in real terms. That’s
not even controversial. It does not mean profits reverse. It does not mean
nominal profits won’t increase forever. It means the rate of accumulation
of real profit slows. The rich still get richer, forever, if we do not
actively dismantle the injustices and energy sapping excesses of rapacious
capitalism. If we do dismantle the excesses of capitalism the rich may
still get forever richer. Fixing the ecological crises can, under some
scenarios (dystopian), enhance the power of the rich.</p><p>There is no historical materialist law that dictates it will happen justly
without active agitation and pressure on governments to change policy. But
if the ecological systems are stressed enough, that social pressure is
inevitable, or we die. The logic Bro “out” is to bite the bullet: “Yeah,
w̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ some of you’s will die.” lol.</p><p>I am not even being &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; here. I am merely being highly autistic, since
that&rsquo;s what I am. I am not out to generate clicks and Likes or Followers.
So take all that I write at face value and assess it for yourself. If it is
a useful alternative framing to fake &ldquo;MMT Marxism&rdquo; then that&rsquo;s good.
It does not detract one iota from Bill&rsquo;s more important messaging:</p><blockquote><p><em>the working class get their lives <em>needlessly</em> ruined under capitalist
modes of production.</em></p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s just fact.</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, you do not have to be an ideological socialist or
marxist or right-wing edge lord to know capitalism is an unjust system
and <em>has to go!</em></p><h2 id=nope-money-has-never-been-commodity><a class=anchor href=#nope-money-has-never-been-commodity title='Anchor for: Nope, Money has Never Been Commodity.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Nope, Money has Never Been Commodity</h2><p>This is a tad too simplistic, but I define a commodity as something that
gets consumed or degraded for use in production. Gold is a commodity
because when used in production it <em>very slowly</em> disintegrates. The time
scale is so slow that it looks like a mere intermediate. But you cannot
run space technology radiation shielding without microscopic loss of gold
atoms, and without limiting use of gold for other technology. Such
properties never apply to a unit of account.</p><p>Mere semantics you say? I say not. By the end of this essay I hope you
realize that it is class warfare against the working class to frame the
State monetary systems as <em>ever</em> having been “commodity money”. There is
no such thing! Money is always an I.O.U of the issuer.</p><p>I wrote this comment:</p><blockquote><p>@10:00 what&rsquo;s happened with Bill? You never concede a false principle.
State money has never been <em>commodity money.</em> Not even in Marx&rsquo;s day. It has
always functioned as a tax credit (generalizing the meaning of &ldquo;tax&rdquo;
sufficiently, but not so much that stealing and plundering gold is a &ldquo;tax&rdquo;
lol). I guess he is trying to simplify things so a dumb-dumb marxist can
listen without having an aneurysm? The distinction is clear: what does the
state currency redeem for? It was never for gold. On paper the currencies
at some times could be swapped for gold certificates, and sometimes bullion.
But what the currency exchanges for does not <em>define</em> the currency. What
defines the unit of account is what the issuer <em>ultimately</em> promises to
redeem. When they run out of gold they stop redeeming for gold
and <em>always</em> continue redeeming for tax liabilities, if not they have
ceased being the government. The tax driven currency has <em>always</em> been
the ultimate.<br>      You can say there have been eras where
a <em><em>commodity peg</em></em> has been used. But that is very far from being a
literal &ldquo;commodity money&rdquo;. On a peg what you look at is <em>still</em> the
scorepoints in your bank account, not a pile of gold.</p></blockquote><p>I think I know what Bill is trying to do, or part of it. There is a need
to get marxist-socialists fully on board with MMT. If for no other reason
they tend to be much nicer kinder people than the right-wing MAGA commie
crowd${}^\dagger$. So you don&rsquo;t want to piss them off by telling
them K. Marx was an
idiot about monetary operations. I have no such qualms though, I don&rsquo;t
think any band of marxist-socialists is going to overthrow Neoliberal
capitalism, though they may certainly help in the effort &mdash; once they
understand basic monetary macroeconomics.</p><p>${}^\dagger$We desperately need nice kind people in leftiepol spaces, who
are not bashing the garden variety working class stiff over the head with
pseudo-woke carry-on. Intersectionality is good: there is no decent
social justice without working class justice.</p><p>I had to add this:</p><blockquote><p>BTW, I regard the proper tax driven currency story as the proper and
true story, and the truth matters. So you can placate an aggressive
marxist/socialist as much as you like by discussing commodity pegs, I have
no problem with that, but you are anti-socialist and anti-worker if you
peddle the false narrative of a pure commodity currency.<br>      Even in small localities, or feudal
cliques, where people literally transported metals or grains or whatever
around to intermediate trading of goods, it was still not a commodity
currency. It was a fancy poker chip. Everyone understood the debt/credit
relation, which is a scorepoint accounting unit relation.</p></blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t make up white lies to placate lefties, you do not <em>need</em> to. If they
are good, honest kind people they&rsquo;ll sooner rather than later grok MMT.
If they are not honest and wise then there&rsquo;s no point fibbing to them to
make them happier about MMT. Realpolitik notwithstanding.</p><p>This is <em>also</em> why the TYT network pivot to the alt-right is not going
to help. They may gain some right-wing rich funders, and help propagate
a pseudo class conscious plebian right-wing sympathy for the working class,
and Bernie-crat style politics. A lot on the right-wing favour
Medicare For All, for instance. But as long as they think they need to get
the currency to &ldquo;pay for&rdquo; it off the billionaires they will fail in their
ultimate efforts to actually get such policy through the government.</p><p>The government representatives (I no longer call them &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; since
that&rsquo;s just plain false) will not vote to pass higher government
investment if they think they have to tax the rich to pay for it. You need
to tell these assholes whom the unwashed masses keep voting into office that
the increased government spending will make rich people richer (in nominal
terms, but it&rsquo;s ok to leave that bit out!). You need to tell the lefties
and pseudo-woke liberals that increased government spending will also make
poor people richer too, and in <em>real terms</em> if not (sadly) also in nominal
terms.</p><p>Then we can start getting to work on reducing the excess purchasing power
the billionaire and investor class have and are not using. We do not need
to tax it all off them, but just motivate them to spend the rets of the
scorepoints. “If you do not spend, we will tax.” How? By running ever
higher government deficits to fill the spending gap (the evidence for
which is unemployment). The Seventh of the 7 Deadly Innocent
Frauds: <em>increased deficits today means higher taxes tomorrow</em>. Myth being
that this is a bad thing, when the fact is that it is a good thing.</p><p>Do we need to mention the time is short on &ldquo;getting to work&rdquo; on this?
Because when it is over the work is not yet done. When that heavy lifting is
done we can get to work starting to avoid ecological catastrophes and
the like. And avoid people blaming &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; on the shut down of the AMOC.</p><hr><p>Let me be clear. &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; is not &ldquo;money & markets&rdquo;". Money & markets
are good things. Capitalism qua Marx is the <em>class relation</em> were a few
people are bosses who do not work to eat, and the majority are wage slaves
who need to beg for employment to eat.</p><p>Expanded public sector services and a Job Guarantee (totally different
things) eliminate Capitalism qua Marx. We do not have to do anything else
to destroy capitalism. If the State stands always ready to hire you for
public purpose at a decent living wage, then you are no longer begging for
private sector employment, and you&rsquo;ve undone Capitalism.</p><p>A relatively painless procedure that the physician need not even issue a
sticking plaster for.</p><p>You can still work for a boss if you like, many will, but it is now more
voluntary. The private firm has to make things pretty nice for you to hire
you out of the public sector during your 9am to 5pm. Although, if public
services are expanded, non-bullshit, then it is probably 11am to 3pm.
The more people honestly working the less hours any one person needs
to work.</p><p>There may still be all sorts of other injustices here and there, like
racism and gender discrimination and disability discrimination, but let&rsquo;s
deal with those <em>as well</em>! It is not &ldquo;let&rsquo;s deal with them later.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>I die a little inside every time I see some youtube Influencer ranting
about the threat of an AI Singularity. Like that is the very least of the
problems I see, it&rsquo;s a fake problem.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL0y3WCCvpU" target=_blank>One professional thinking person guy</a>
was even thinking (if you can call it that) the real threat is
from dumbing people down. Again&mldr; that&rsquo;s the least of my worries. If you
want an Ai to do all your trickier cognitive work for you, then you should
get Ai to do all your harder cognitive work for you, that leaves you free
to do more useful kinetic things like take care of young and elderly people
who can&rsquo;t do the muscle work of changing their own clothes and things like
that. If you truly need an Ai to tell you how to make up a fresh bed, then
it is only you who are doomed, not human civilization. Don&rsquo;t watch so many
scifi dystopia movies. Or if you do, understand the meaning
of &ldquo;Cautionary Tale&rdquo;. It is a Tale.</p><p>What I wrote to that un-Thinking philosopher person was that the true
challenge is spiritual struggle, not nerdy intellectual struggle.</p><p>Besides, have you ever tried dumbing down an <em>actual</em> nerd? It&rsquo;s like
trying to flatten a balloon without popping it. If an Ai can solve a puzzle,
the nerd will still try to solve it unless it is a brute force hack.
And we (society) are all that much better and resilient for this redundancy
in puzzle solvers.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../79_science_fun_and_dings>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../81_razoring_wilkerson>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../79_science_fun_and_dings>Science Fun and Dings</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../81_razoring_wilkerson>Razoring Wilkerson</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
