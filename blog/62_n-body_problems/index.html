I revert like a child to hard scifi
when depressed and unable to focus.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_%28novel%29 target=_blank>Three Body Problem</a>
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still&mldr; it
did the job. However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the
novels is now screening, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that&rsquo;s an opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some
major fodder from for writing for popular consumption.</p><p>Geeky stuff out of the way first?</p><h2 id=chaos-theory><a class=anchor href=#chaos-theory title='Anchor for: Chaos Theory.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Chaos Theory</h2><p>The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable.
Henri Poincare was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge
in prediction from reality.</p><p>In the 1960&rsquo;s the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple
model of &ldquo;weather&rdquo; (fluid convection). Eventually some heterodox economists
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium,
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leader in
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling. This is due to the
whole ideological indoctrination that &ldquo;perfect markets&rdquo; thinking does for you.
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. ðŸ¤£</p><p>((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a
little neoclassical baby?))</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy
round-tables you crank.</p><h3 id=instability-versus-unpredictability><a class=anchor href=#instability-versus-unpredictability title='Anchor for: Instability versus Unpredictability.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Instability versus Unpredictability</h3><p>One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$
with in swishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at
relative prices).</p><p>Sadly this is delusional.</p><p>${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity,
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not
appropriate.</p><p>The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbit about an ideal
equilibrium. They are quasi-periodic motions far-from-equilibrium. But this
does not mean the economy is unstable. It means it is unpredictable. There is
a big difference.</p><h2 id=remembrance-of-earths-past><a class=anchor href=#remembrance-of-earths-past title='Anchor for: Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</h2><p>Whoa! Cixin Liu is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little
over-rated. I loved <em>Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu</em> when I was a teenager, but
when I matured I better understood why the Monte Python skit is even funnier
than it first appears. The Proustian romance and pathos is one thing, but
you really can&rsquo;t appreciate it until you&rsquo;ve lived a good life and have
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. I sometimes wonder what
my life would be like if I had been sparred all the heartache and sorrow?
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.</p><p>Anyhow, I guess I will have some thing to say about the politics of hard
scifi, and will use the <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> trilogy as a case
study, since&mldr; why not? <em>Game of Thrones</em> is over-cooked by now.</p><p>For scifi fans, I&rsquo;d recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal
average &ldquo;ADHD&rdquo; (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama.</p><h3 id=the-premise><a class=anchor href=#the-premise title='Anchor for: The Premise.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Premise</h3><p>I&rsquo;ll be writing as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge of the plot
twists.</p><p>I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about
his politics. To summarize, he&rsquo;s a little bit apolitical, but has this weird
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization&mldr;
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI" target=_blank>offended some scifi fans</a>
.
It is propaganda? Whoa!</p><p>But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn&rsquo;t put an author&rsquo;s political
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember <em>The Matrix</em>?</p><p>I will confess then that I liked the premise of <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em>.
The one-liner &ldquo;Physics does not exist, and never will exist&rdquo; is pretty good.
WHy? IUt is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for
how the heck physics cannot exist!</p><p>In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures, or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.</p><p>Newtons&rsquo; Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein&rsquo;s gravity, quantum mechanics &mdash;
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the
interaction of matter and spacetime.</p><p>Hence, and Lui Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.</p><p>This opens up a panoply of something like a Matrix universe, one that is
programmed and at the whim of the &ldquo;universal programmer&rdquo;. (Wolfram physics
ya nerds! ðŸ¤£) I cannot tell if that is where Lui Cixin takes the story, but
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin&rsquo;.'</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:15%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../61_inflation_starts_with_monopoly>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../61_inflation_starts_with_monopoly>Start from Duelling Monopolies</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
