I revert like a child to hard scifi
when depressed and unable to focus.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_%28novel%29 target=_blank>Three Body Problem</a>
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still&mldr; it
did the job. However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the
novels is now screening, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that&rsquo;s an
opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some
major fodder from while writing for popular consumption.</p><p>Geeky stuff out of the way first?</p><h2 id=chaos-theory><a class=anchor href=#chaos-theory title='Anchor for: Chaos Theory.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Chaos Theory</h2><p>The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable.
Henri PoincarÃ© was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge
in prediction from reality.</p><p>It has been a rather silent triumph of Twentieth and 21st century mathematics
that stable solutions to the gravitational three body problem
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-023-10177-w target=_blank>have been discovered</a>
,
but no one was expecting this to be possible. However, it is still true that
general solutions are nearly impossible to compute.</p><p>Remarkably, in 1912 Karl Fritiof Sundman proved there is a way to compute
the general solution to the gravitational 3-body problem. Unfortunately it is
totally impractical. In any case, the gravitational problem of most interest
to us is for our solar system, which is what&mldr; a 1-body problem? That means
ignoring the moons of planets and the asteroid belt. So you might be surprised
that in the real world solar systems are fairly stable even though mathematics
says they should not be stable. The resolution is found in knowing the time
scales involved. NASA or any future space engineers, can safely plot
trajectories for spacecraft on year-long time scales because the typical time
periods over which our solar system becomes unpredictable are extremely long
in duration. Also, space navigators do not need to know analytical solutions,
they can compute approximate trajectories numerically with decent precision.
Again, that&rsquo;s because they are operating with time scales far shorter than
that of the orbits of the planets and moons.</p><p>Also, to emphasize the point: instability and predictability are totally
different concepts. Our solar system is both (like), it is for sure
unpredictable, but might also be unstable. However this matter little to
human space explorers because the time over which planetary motions get
unpredictable is on the order of years or maybe centuries (I am not exactly
sure of the typical time period off the top of my head), not hours or days.
Even if our solar system is stable over millions of years (no planets will
collide or shoot off to infinity) it is still unpredictable over perhaps
thousand year intervals. That just means we need a lot more data to predict
where planets will be exactly in a thousand years compared to next year.
We&rsquo;d need much more than a thousand times as much precision data.</p><p>In the 1960&rsquo;s the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple
model of &ldquo;weather&rdquo; (fLiud convection). Eventually some heterodox economists
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium too
(will wonders never cease),
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leaders in
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling. This is due to the
whole ideological indoctrination that &ldquo;perfect markets&rdquo; thinking does for you.
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. ðŸ¤£</p><p>((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a
little neoclassical baby?))</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy
round-tables you crank.</p><h3 id=instability-versus-unpredictability><a class=anchor href=#instability-versus-unpredictability title='Anchor for: Instability versus Unpredictability.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Instability versus Unpredictability</h3><p>One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$
with in wishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at
relative prices).</p><p>Sadly this is delusional.</p><p>${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity,
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not
appropriate.</p><p>In fact delusions of this nature are more akin to illusions. Like seeing Jesus
in the Turin Shroud. The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbits
about an ideal equilibrium. They are quasi-periodic motions
far-from-equilibrium. But this does not mean the economy is unstable. It means
it is unpredictable. There is a big difference.</p><p>Chaotic systems can of course also be unstable. Our Solar System is thought to
be unstable, though no one can prove it for sure, what a dynamicist can do is
point out our solar system is generically unstable, meaning it would be pretty
lucky if it were stable. They can also tell us the characteristic time scale for
instability (the time period up until which the motions of the Sun and our
neighbouring planets is constrained to more or less fixed orbits). I forget
the number, but the characteristic period is probably on the order of
billions of years. the Sun could die out before any of our planets go haywire
and shoot off to interstellar &ldquo;infinity&rdquo;. (Don&rsquo;t quote me on this. If you want
to know then pull up a DuckDuckGo or

tab.)
About 17 billion years before any likely major planetary collision?</p><h2 id=remembrance-of-earths-past><a class=anchor href=#remembrance-of-earths-past title='Anchor for: Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</h2><p>Whoa! Liu Cixin is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little
over-rated. I loved reading <em>Ã€ la Recherche du Temps Perdu</em> when I was a
teenager, but when I matured I better understood why the Monte Python skit is
even funnier than it first appears. The Proustian romance and pathos is one
thing, but you really can&rsquo;t appreciate it until you&rsquo;ve lived a good life and have
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. Same for
Mishima&rsquo;s <em>Sea of Fertility</em> &mdash; even in translation it was a heck of a
trilogy to read, and a masterpiece of Japanese literary art, all despite
Yukio Mishima&rsquo;s warped politics and odd-duck lifestyle. I sometimes wonder
what my life would be like if I had been spared all the heartache and sorrow?
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.</p><p>Anyhow, I guess I will have something to say about the politics of hard
scifi, and will use the <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> trilogy as a case
study, since&mldr; why not? <em>Game of Thrones</em> is over-cooked by now.</p><p>For scifi fans, I&rsquo;d recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal
average &ldquo;ADHD&rdquo; (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama.</p><h3 id=the-premise><a class=anchor href=#the-premise title='Anchor for: The Premise.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Premise</h3><p>I&rsquo;ll be writing in real-time as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge
of the plot twists.</p><p>I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about
his politics. To summarize, he&rsquo;s a little bit apolitical, but has this weird
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization&mldr;
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI" target=_blank>offended some scifi fans</a>
.
Is <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> really Chinese state propaganda? Whoa!</p><p>But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn&rsquo;t put an author&rsquo;s political
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember <em>The Matrix</em>?</p><p>At worst, dumb-dumb politics ruins the novel immersive experience, so it&rsquo;s
depressing. I rarely get angry and fumed up about it, no novelist is perfect.</p><p>I will confess then that I liked the premise of <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em>.
The one-liner &ldquo;Physics does not exist, and never will exist&rdquo; is pretty good.
Why? It is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for
how the heck physics cannot exist!</p><p>In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures,
or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study
of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.</p><p>Newton&rsquo;s Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein&rsquo;s gravity, quantum mechanics &mdash;
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the
interaction of matter and spacetime.</p><p>Hence, and Liu Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the
symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.</p><p>This opens up a panoply of something like a <em>Matrix</em> universe, one that is
programmed and at the whim of the &ldquo;universal programmer&rdquo;. (Wolfram physics
ya nerds! ðŸ¤£) I cannot tell if that is where Liu Cixin takes the story, but
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin'.</p><p>Having not yet gotten to the crux of <em>Three Body Problem</em>, I have to insert my
own bit of politics.</p><h2 id=harder-scifi><a class=anchor href=#harder-scifi title='Anchor for: Harder scifi.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Harder scifi</h2><p>I reckon you can take <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> as poetic allegory. I am
damn sure this is not what Liu Cixin was thinking, but I&rsquo;m telling you this
is one way I can absorb the whole idea looming in <em>Three Body Problem</em>.
Which metaphors then? Well, you can say &ldquo;Capitalism does not exist, and never
will exist&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s almost too comical.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>The way I think of the Marxist counter to capitalism is as a bit of a fantasy.
Neither the capitalists nor the marxists are living in reality as far as I
can tell. Their economics does not exist. So I&rsquo;d get my proper poetic analogy
via &ldquo;Economics does not exist&rdquo;.</p><p>As allegory I&rsquo;d take this to mean our economy surely exists (as does matter
and spacetime probably in <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em>? Not yet sure!) The
problem is that what <em>economists think</em> economics <em>is</em> is totally unreal.
That&rsquo;d be my poetic take on the <em>Three Body Problem</em> story.</p><p>The only trouble is this is a <em>good</em> thing, whereas in the <em>Three Body Problem</em>
it is supposedly getting teed up as a bad thing? (&ldquo;Physics does not exist&rdquo; is
some sort of incipient war on science or intellectuals in the story?)</p><p>This is at least a nice way to enjoy the scifi story, because I am unable to
enjoy it much as a physicist myself. It is too fantastical, so not good
enough hard scifi. I cannot tolerate fantasy literature for long periods.
Short stories with some sort of allegorical moral fable are ok, but the
immersive fantasy literature stuff is to me like reading superhero comics.
A complete waste of my time when I was a kid, like Commodore 64 video games.</p><p>I know adults indulge in these forms of entertainment, and a million people
watch reality TV shows. I just don&rsquo;t understand it &mdash; who has that amount of
free time? Or&mldr; what the heck is wrong with me that I don&rsquo;t have such free
time?</p><p>The reason <em>The Matrix</em> was cool was because you could read it as allegory for
a materialistic society. Even if the Wachowski&rsquo;s did not intend for this to be
the poetic reading. Who has you trapped in the real Matrix? You do. You
and your ego and insatiable desires for material wealth and comforts.
Agent Smith was, all said and done, a human invention. To extract yourself
from the real Matrix you want to recognize what truly matters in your life.
And that&rsquo;d be love and kindness. Waking up from the real Matrix means becoming
a more spiritual person.</p><p>In the macroeconomics/political economy, allegory Agent Smith is something
like the White Supremacist or Neocon or Christian Fascist (they&rsquo;re not
entirely disjoint categories). His &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is rule of the machines. Or not
even that, it is rule by Agent Smith, beyond fascism (the nation is sacred)
to total monarchy (the King is sacred). ((I always shed a tear for my friends
in Thailand at such points in my thought. One nation within which a sizeable
proportion of citizens still has a very unhealthy attitude to their
monarch.))</p><p>This leads to the extension of my allegory: humanity in our times is in fact
gripped by the tentacles of an insidious sort of vague ideology. I&rsquo;d call it
neoliberalism, but it goes beyond the narrow meaning of that word. It extends
to the whole plethora of false doctrines in economics, macroeconomics, sociology
and politics that tells us human beings are mere animals and incapable of peace.
The idea is we have to be competitive${}^\dagger$, this is how we survive, we
have to dominate others, and moreover this is bred into us in our DNA&mldr; and
so forth. I will not belabour the whole blackpill nihilist thesis, there are
too many varieties, I&rsquo;m just sketching the cartoon of the idea. However, I
do mean to refer to the real world.</p><p>${}^\dagger$Or, more extreme, the idea we do not have any choice in the
matter, since we have no free will (the idiocy of Sam Harris,
Robert Sapolsky and their like). ((First define &ldquo;free will&rdquo; for me bros!))</p><p>It is a pervasive ideology, infecting popular culture and social discourse
everywhere, and it is ruinous for the chances of a decent civilization.
However, unlike nihilists, I believe humanity has the collective capacity to
overcome this narrow dystopian world view. Call me an optimist, a hopeless
romantic, but it is what I believe is possible. Just don&rsquo;t ask me to offer
any probabilities. I&rsquo;d say 100%, but have no clue what the time-frame would
be. Asymptotics is easy, real-time dynamics is hard-to-impossible. But this
is also not the topic of this article today.</p><h2 id=the-farmer-and-the-shooter-hypotheses><a class=anchor href=#the-farmer-and-the-shooter-hypotheses title='Anchor for: The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses</h2><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO:

the venerable and gentle Dr Ye Wenjie about &ldquo;physics does not exist&rdquo;.
She answers that it is not that physics does not exist, but that what we think
is physics is wrong.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the spin the Netflix adaptation will have this, nor am I sure
if this remark will play out in the original novels, but it is a crux&mldr; for me at
least, worth writing about&mldr; and with my allegorical interpretation too.</p><p>Ye Wenjie likens scientists now to the Church of old, who thought Copernicus
as guilty of heresy, Bruno and d&rsquo;Ascoli worth the stake, and Galileo worth
the Spanish Inquisition. Or she says, &ldquo;Maybe we are like the Church.&rdquo; Meaning
with respect to today&rsquo;s scientific apostates.</p><p>It is a lot less dramatic for physics these days though, than it is for
political economy, since physics base marble is in pretty close contact with
us now though particle accelerators and cosmology, and quantum computing of
course (very base level, since the QC&rsquo;s are exploiting entanglement).
Entanglement is the base marble of our universe, and perhaps it is no
accident SchrÃ¶dinger&rsquo;s Cat gets a mention in the immediately preceding scene
with the detective Shi Qiang.</p><p>We are nowhere near the base marble of economics, but MMT is part of the base.
A huge gap remains in orthodox and even MMT-inspired political economy, and
that is the spiritual realm, and I&rsquo;ve not encountered any professional
economists who even dare acknowledge this yet &mdash; maybe there are a few like
Kate Raworth or Jason Hickel, but I do not really know for sure, are they
merely acting ethically because they think it good for themselves, or do
they realize spiritual principles are at the very heart of true economics?</p><p>Not just ecological principles, but spiritual principles.
I suspect they do not acknowledge. They place the ecology ahead as primary,
but this is a grave mistake, because we cannot have a sound ecosystem by just
asserting ecology is important. Spiritual prerequisites are needed, even if
only at a bare minimum level of political recognition that the ecological
economics importance is something worth caring about.</p><p>If your economists do not care about ecology then nothing wil be done
politically. The ecological economics academics can scream their heads off,
it will only be when people dying is a clear consequence of ignorance of
ecology that politicians will lift a finger to dial the ecologists and invite
them to the table. Too late. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to play out that way.
If people can learn spiritual principles are more important even than ecology,
then there is hope of avoiding catastrophe. I know it is a hard ask for a
realist, even harder for a dumb-dumb materialist, but you&rsquo;ve got to ask.</p><p>((At this point through reading 3BOP, I am certianly worried (for my
entertainment pleasure) that Liu Cixin might head towards blackpill
nihilism. I hope that&rsquo;s not the case. Getting immersed into a story
is a wonderful form of entertainment, but if the bubble is shattered it&rsquo;s
kinda&rsquo; depressing, which defeats the purpose.))</p><p>Interestingly, although I am not close friends with Warren Mosler, I think he
has a moral component to his work over the decades on what became MMT. He has
always said he talks to anyone in power or schools or the general public who
is listening, out of a sense of public duty and moral obligation. Few other
economists teach from this motive. They teach from textbooks for a paycheck
and academic career. They have no idea at least 25% of what they teach is
nonsense, and in fact unethical. If you know this, what are you teaching for?</p><p>Never teach for a paycheck.</p><p>Expect a paycheck, but don&rsquo;t let that be the reason you teach. OK, I do not
personally know a lot of economics teachers, I&rsquo;m just guessing, but prove me
wrong! Can it be that they are not teaching economics for a pay check and
yet refuse to inquire into the fundamental truths of the subject?
What I do know is that Mosler at least does not do it for any income. He is
pure. But, of course, considered a crank and heretic by mainstream economists,
of all persuasions, post-keynesians, marxists, new Keynesians and
neoclassical alike. Warren Mosler is a Copernicus of our times. It is
lucky Stephanie Kelton has not yet been burned at the metaphorical stake.
You could say Steve Keen was the one burned at the stake, but like you&rsquo;d
expect for an Aussie, he survived the ordeal and only increased his cuss word
frequency.</p><h2 id=suspended-judgment><a class=anchor href=#suspended-judgment title='Anchor for: Suspended Judgment.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Suspended Judgment</h2><p>There&rsquo;s little point ruining a fantasy scifi story with realist gripes. However,
I can make an exception when you put characters and actors in entertianment
jeopardy &mdash; by which I mean painting them histrionically. It ruins the pure
entertainment experience, at least for us hard scifi art snobs. This is what
Liu Cixin seemed to have to contrive.</p><p>Here is what I mean. Imagine the scenario of <em>begin confronted with outright
miracles</em> was a thing, and was presented only to a few top scientists. What
would be their response? It would not be to commit suicide. Did Liu Cixin
really need to make the story about physicist suicides? It think that was
unnecessary for the plot. Most physicists I know would be intrigued, and
first would look to counsel one another to check not everyone was going
insane. Science just is not done in such isolation as portrayed in
<em>Three Body Problem</em>. And it did not have to be written that way. The
crisis could have been instead sheer confusion among the physicists. It&rsquo;d
be far more natural that the physicists would get together. There is the
Frontier of Science group in the story, who are a bit mystical &mdash; and I
think that will be integral to the plot later (probably aliens?). But a
more sedate and investigative world committee of physicists exploring the
miracles would have been equally as compelling a story, more interesting,
and more realistic.</p><p>((Note: the Netflix version might be different, I do not know.))</p><p>Liu Cixin did get it right mostly though, where it mattered, because he had
the one anti-hero, Wang Miao, respond to the miracles realistically. That was
incredibly important for me to stick with the book. Wang Miao realized the
miracle of the <em>countdown</em> was subjective, and that means the laws of physics are
not really vamoosed. It allowed the character to find empathy and friendship with
the desultory and roughish, but ultimately loveable, detective Shi Qiang.</p><p>Yes, the response of a realistic community of physicists would in our real
world been more like Wang Maio&rsquo;s response, but then i guess a few plot turns
in <em>Three Body Problem</em> might not be &ldquo;available&rdquo;. Too bad I say. Eliminate
them! Make the story more believable. It would be a better work of art. As
it stands, Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past is probably a scifi classic, but not
reaching the level of literary epic. I will probably still finish the trilogy.
Stay tuned them for more on the 3BP allegory.</p><p>The real gripe I have here is a very general critique of all literature and
movies when it comes to heros. If you have a single character as the hero or
anti-hero your story is, I am afraid to say, not realistic. But there is no
need to write a novel this way, with a main central protagonist/heroine/hero.</p><p>The same trope ruined <em>The Expanse</em> &mdash; although I loved those books too, to
me, just subjectively, they were epic, although not great literature.</p><p>Does Iain Banks write form a more humanistic perspective? Ursula LeGuin? If
they have I&rsquo;ve not heard of the novels.</p><div style=text-align:center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

adaptation. It depicts our solar system living within a larger cosmos, as if
our entire universe was sitting inside the tip of a piece of carbon nanotube.
A similar concept is put to more comedic purposes in the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kVUPZ8_UJ4" target=_blank>ending sequence of</a>
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kVUPZ8_UJ4" target=_blank>Men in Black</a></em> if I recall.</p><p>The <em>bona fide</em> real physics concept here is called conformal or <em>scale</em>
invariance. It is the idea that our laws of physics are not sensitive to the
overall scale of things. So we could magnify everything up by a googol-fold
and no one should notice the difference. It is an approximate symmetry in
some areas of physics, notably electromagnetism and some string theory
models.</p><p>It also is a symmetry that probably holds for time scales in our universe
close to our so-called Big Bang. In fact, some cosmologists &mdash; notably
Neil Turok and Latham Boyle &mdash; believe (and can show with their math) that a
whole lot of particle physics makes a whole lot more sense if our universe had
an exact conformal symmetry at the Big Bang. If it did, then there is little
need to explain where the Big Bang came from, since the supposed singularity
at our conformal time $\tau=0$ would not truly exist, it&rsquo;d be a reflection
symmetry boundary. In a 4D Block universe conception of Nature this says
that nothing came before the Big Bang, and the origin of our universe is
then something more global.</p><p>Whatever put us all here, put the whole 4D thing here, all at once,
so-to-speak. Or at least implicitly, since nothing exists on the other side
of a mirror. Nothing exists on the other side of our Big Bang. (Some people
like to think there is an actual Mirror universe on the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; &mdash; but
a reflection reflects, it does not transmit. Just sayin&rsquo;.)</p><p>If you prefer a cosmology where a universe does exist through a conformal
symmetry boundary then Roger Penrose has a Conformal Cyclic Cosmology for
you to work on, but it is by far the harder physics to get right, and is
probably wrong.</p><p>There is however a hybrid of Turok&ndash;Boyle and Penrose, due to Anthony Lasenby
and colleagues, which is that a far future conformal symmetry could possibly
be &ldquo;lived thorough&rdquo; (for elementary particles, not biological life) but the
universe on the other side would be time reflected with respect to ours. That&rsquo;s
a wild one to wrap your head around, but &ldquo;follow the math&rdquo;. It is not illogical
nor inconceivable.</p><p>Since this is not my physics blog, I think I will leave this topic here.
I cannot quite turn it to useful allegory.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:15%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../61_inflation_starts_with_monopoly>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../61_inflation_starts_with_monopoly>Start from Duelling Monopolies</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
