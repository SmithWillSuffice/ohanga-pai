I revert like a child to hard scifi
when depressed and unable to focus.
<em><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_%28novel%29 target=_blank>Three Body Problem</a></em>
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still&mldr; it
did the job. However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the
novels is now streaming, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that&rsquo;s an
opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some
major fodder from while writing for popular consumption.</p><p>Geeky stuff out of the way first?</p><h2 id=chaos-theory><a class=anchor href=#chaos-theory title='Anchor for: Chaos Theory.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Chaos Theory</h2><p>The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable.
Henri Poincaré was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge
in prediction from reality.</p><p>In modern times exact solutions have been found, but they are incredibly
special, and do not occur naturally. They are what you would call mathematical
results, not truly physical. (That is so even if we ignored effects of quantum
mechanics and general relativity.) This is a major plot failure in
<em>The Three Body Problem</em>, since the humans attempting to solve the solar
system calendar problem for the Trisolarians would know the Newtonian problem
is not physical. In the novels this is turned into a feature, since those
humans are portrayed as pseudo-religious. They&rsquo;ve wilfully, one presumes,
ignored general relativity (time dilation effects). Presumably the attempt to
Redeem humanity is merely an attempt to show the Trisolarians humans are
capable of solving incredibly hard but useless mathematics puzzles.
(<font style="color: #dab720;">Cryptocurrency</font> all over again! 🤣) Or at
least that&rsquo;s they way I
have to read the novel to enjoy it!</p><p>((Oh no! I can already feel this blog post is going to have the highest lol
emoji density of them all.))</p><p>It has been a rather silent triumph of Twentieth and 21st century mathematics
that stable solutions to the gravitational three body problem
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-023-10177-w target=_blank>have been discovered</a>
,
but no one was expecting this to be possible. However, it is still true that
general solutions are nearly impossible to compute.</p><p>When I write &ldquo;impossible to compute&rdquo; I have a technical result in mind, one
can read more <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02312.pdf target=_blank>here</a>
and
more for lay readers <a href=https://blbadger.github.io/3-body-problem.html target=_blank>here</a></p><p>Remarkably, in 1912 Karl Fritiof Sundman proved there is a way to compute
the general solution to the gravitational 3-body problem. Unfortunately it is
totally impractical. In any case, the gravitational problem of most interest
to us is for our solar system, which is what&mldr; a 10-body problem?${}^\dagger$
That means ignoring the moons of planets and the asteroid belt. So you might be
surprised that in the real world solar systems are fairly stable even though
mathematics says they should generically not be stable. The resolution is
found in knowing the time scales involved. NASA or any future space engineers,
can safely plot trajectories for spacecraft on year-long time scales because
the typical time periods over which our solar system becomes unpredictable are
extremely long in duration. Also, space navigators do not need to know
analytical solutions, they can compute approximate trajectories numerically
with decent precision. Again, that&rsquo;s because they are operating with time
scales far shorter than that of the orbits of the planets and moons.</p><p>(${}^\dagger$A reddit&rsquo;er, who else, points out the Trisolarians face a 4-body
problem, since they have three Suns, plus their planet.😂 Completely missing
the point that on a calendar prediction time-scale the perturbations of a
planet on a star are truly negligible. Even with chaotic motion. If you cannot
measure the initial configuration of the three stars within a millimetre, then
your puny planet&rsquo;s effect will be less than the chaotic motion divergence.)</p><p>Also, to emphasize the point: instability and predictability are totally
different concepts. Our solar system is both, it is for sure
unpredictable, but might also be unstable. However this matters little to
human space explorers because the time over which planetary motions get
unpredictable is on the order of years or maybe centuries (I am not exactly
sure of the typical time period off the top of my head), not days or years.
Even if our solar system is stable over millions of years (no planets will
collide or shoot off to infinity) it is still unpredictable over perhaps
thousand year intervals. That just means we need a lot more data to predict
where planets will be exactly in a thousand years compared to next year.
We&rsquo;d need much more than a thousand times as much precision data.</p><p>In the 1960&rsquo;s the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple
model of &ldquo;weather&rdquo; (fluid convection). Eventually some heterodox economists
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium too
(will wonders never cease),
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leaders in
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling. This is due to the
whole ideological indoctrination that &ldquo;perfect markets&rdquo; thinking does for you.
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. 🤣</p><p>((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a
little neoclassical baby?))</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy
round-tables you crank.</p><h3 id=instability-versus-unpredictability><a class=anchor href=#instability-versus-unpredictability title='Anchor for: Instability versus Unpredictability.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Instability versus Unpredictability</h3><p>One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$
with in wishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at
relative prices).</p><p>Sadly this is delusional.</p><p>${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity,
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not
appropriate.</p><p>In fact delusions of this nature are more akin to illusions. Like seeing Jesus
in the Turin Shroud. The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbits
about an ideal equilibrium. They are (generically) quasi-periodic motions
far-from-equilibrium. But this does not mean the economy is unstable. It means
it is unpredictable. There is a big difference.</p><p>Chaotic systems can of course also be unstable. Our Solar System is thought to
be unstable, though no one can prove it for sure, what a dynamicist can do is
point out our solar system is generically unstable, meaning it would be pretty
lucky if it were stable. They can also tell us the characteristic time scale for
instability (the time period up until which the motions of the Sun and our
neighbouring planets is constrained to more or less fixed orbits). I forget
the number, but the characteristic period is probably on the order of
billions of years. The Sun could die out before any of our planets go haywire
and shoot off to interstellar &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; or two planets collide. (Don&rsquo;t quote
me on this. If you want to know then pull up a DuckDuckGo or

About 17 billion years before any likely major planetary collision?</p><h3 id=hard-scifi-gripes><a class=anchor href=#hard-scifi-gripes title='Anchor for: Hard scifi Gripes?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Hard scifi Gripes?</h3><p>I have no interest in critiquing the &ldquo;Physics of Three Body&rdquo;. But I can&rsquo;t
help myself. You can search youtube for people doing reaction videos to
<em>Three Body Problem</em>, and so I might be entirely redundant. What I do care
about is being a bit of a hard scifi snob. My attitude is why put in fantasy
elements into a good scifi story if you could instead make it far more
interesting with heavy realism?</p><p>The honest truth is there is far too much physics that gets stretched in
<em>Three Body</em> the novel than I have time or patience to critique, so I&rsquo;m
letting it rest, except for when there is an interesting literary angle to
comment upon.</p><p>The first one worth mentioning is the 3BP virtual reality game character,
von Neumann. He and the game&rsquo;s Isaac Newton, along with the main
protagonist Wang Miao, convince a feudal emperor to build a human computer,
with 30 million soldiers doing essentially mindless logic gate tasks. The
trouble with this plot line is that they appear to be building a general
purpose computer. What I&rsquo;d have done is construct a single purpose 30 million
solider machine. Less prone to error, faster compute. However, this is truly a
pedantic gripe, because Liu Cixin writes the correct realist reason the 30 million
soldier computer fails to predict the Trisolar orbits &mdash; namely the Newtonian
dynamics model lacked general relativity corrections.</p><p>Knowing this, you might ask why the classical three body problem to this day
still attracts some mathematicians? I cannot tell you why, except that
mathematicians are fond of torture.</p><p>((In the novels this is attributed to the psychological acquisition of a
false religion, a pseudo-religion, among the Redemptionist faction of the ETO.
They begin to simply believe as a matter of faith that <em>if</em> they solve the
three body problem the Trisolarians will leave Earth alone. By the way, this
fits my definition of <em>religion</em> &mdash; which is &ldquo;A source of Good.&rdquo; The
Redemptionists believe their solving the 3BP will lead to good for all, so
it is at least a pseudo-religion. It is also a false religion because their
solving the 3BP is not a source of Good. It is merely a source of interesting
mathematics which is morally neutral, inapplicable to the real world.))</p><p>Why are mathematicians so fond of torture? Why would they work on a Newtonian
mechanics problem that has no real world applications?</p><p>I imagine their response would be, &ldquo;Sure, sure general relativity makes the
three body problem pure art, not science. But so what? Mathematics is <em>art</em>!&rdquo;</p><p>I happen to agree with this attitude. But you should know it is painful art.
One never knows when a piece will be finished, nor whether certain subjective
standards of elegance will be met. Often the aesthetics really suck. But the
humble mathematician indulges in this tortuous art anyway.</p><p>Applied Mathematics is very different, for here one does seek utility in
physics or other sciences, and no one alive today working on the Newtonian
three body problem would be accused of being an applied mathematician.</p><p>However&mldr; if someone ever did figure out an efficient algorithm for real-time
Newtonian dynamics, it is possible it might find a real world application.
But because solar system dynamics does require general relativity, it would
not be an application in astronomy or space travel&mldr; or I guess it could be
used for very short time-scale trajectory computations, where effects of
general relativity are negligible.</p><p>For normies: I cannot easily describe why general relativity turns astronomy
dynamics into a nightmare, you&rsquo;ll have to take it upon authority it does.
The equations for general relativity are so severely difficult to compute
that exact solutions are known only for truly incredibly symmetric spacetimes,
and they are&mldr; what?&mldr; less than a handful in number, and totally useless
for astronomical applications. (Fascinatingly, these maximally symmetric
solutions are very useful in theoretical work, because a couple of them
describe ideal approximations to at least two very important real physical
phenomena: the entire cosmos, and rotating black holes.)</p><p>Having said that, with enough computing power general relativistic systems,
like colliding black holes, can be pretty well simulated these days, so the
lesson there is with gargantuan enough compute power, the classical three
body problem has about the same status as a relativistic gravitational problem.
All of them are hard problems in real applications.</p><p>The astounding thing is that the Newtonian three body problem is so damn
hard! It should be a lot easier than a typical GR calculation, but in
computational algorithmic terms the problems are about the same. This is
typical for chaotic dynamics. If the system has any non-linearity, then,</p><ul><li>the computations to solve the system numerically will be hard,</li><li>they&rsquo;ll all be about as hard as each other for the same $N$.</li><li>The bigger $N$ the worse, exponentially so, so extremely frickin&rsquo; harder.</li></ul><p>and it gets even more interesting,</p><ul><li>Once $N$ becomes truly gargantuan, the $N$-body problem can be immensely
simplified to the point of &ldquo;solvability&rdquo; &mdash; this occurs when there are so
many molecules that the entire system can be coarsely described on a large
scale using statistical mechanics.</li></ul><p>With statistical mechanics we give up worrying about what any one body is
doing, entirely, we are not interested in the single body trajectories, and
instead we define macroscopic variables, like temperature, pressure, volume,
density, and these fictional variables are then treated as new higher order or
emergent variables. Even if the molecular dynamics are highly chaotic, the
macroscopic variable time evolution can, under strict conditions, be simple
and solvable. The class of such solvable statistical mechanics systems are
those in equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium.</p><p>This has concern for my macroeconomics and political economy allegory. The
macroeconomic system we live within is &mdash; luckily${}^\ddagger$ &mdash; not in thermal equilibrium
in any sense. This is essentially why neoclassical economics does not work.
(And also why, perhaps to the chagrin of some socialists, why Austrian School
economics is not entirely stupid. The Austrians are dummies only because they
think gold is currency and &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; are possible, neither of which is
true, so in the end they are as rotten as the neoclassicals. Being half-right
in a field where Justice and Trust matter is as good as being all wrong.)</p><p>${}^\ddagger$&ldquo;Luckily&rdquo; because an economic system in equilibrium would mean we
are all dead&mldr;. or all Borg.</p><p>As the baby of all hard chaos dynamics problems, the three body problem has
a sort of mythic status. That is another reason why pure mathematicians might
like the problem. (By the way, the Trisolarians, like humans, would have known
this well before being capable of interstellar travel.) How would we know
macroeconomic systems are in a state of equilibrium? We would know if the
macroeconomics could be well-described by a small number of dynamical variables
(analogies to temperature, volume, density &c.)</p><p>In fact, our macroeconomic systems (taken per country, say) are
far-from-equilibrium systems, but also not totally anarchic. There are
macroscopic observables that can usefully describe the time evolution of a
macroeconomy. The analogy is like a complicated fluid, or the weather.
Although this is only a very weak analogy.</p><p>In particular, while the Sun tends to monopolize the behaviour of our weather,
governments tend to monopolize the behaviour of our macroeconomics. And to
extend the analogy somewhat comically, while the Sun does not know what it is
doing to us, nor do politicians in government know what they are doing to the
macroeconomy. I take this <em>not</em> as an argument against government and for
anarchy, but rather an argument for a better informed and educated
government. If you have something as powerful as the Sun but exists next door
at room temperature and has eyes and ears and an email account, it could be
a good idea to use it for the greater Good.</p><p>Does that sound like an endorsement of authoritarianism to you? It should not,
but to see why&mldr; read onwards!</p><h2 id=remembrance-of-earths-past><a class=anchor href=#remembrance-of-earths-past title='Anchor for: Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</h2><p>Whoa! Liu Cixin is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little
over-rated. I loved reading <em>À la Recherche du Temps Perdu</em> when I was a
teenager, but when I matured I better understood why the Monty Python skit is
even funnier than it first appears. The Proustian romance and pathos is one
thing, but you really can&rsquo;t appreciate it until you&rsquo;ve lived a good life and have
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. Same for
Mishima&rsquo;s <em>Sea of Fertility</em> &mdash; even in translation it was a heck of a
trilogy to read, and a masterpiece of Japanese literary art, all despite
Yukio Mishima&rsquo;s warped politics and odd-duck lifestyle. I sometimes wonder
what my life would be like if I had been spared all the heartache and sorrow?
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.</p><p>Anyhow, I guess I will have something to say about the politics of hard
scifi, and will use the <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> trilogy as a case
study, since&mldr; why not? <em>Game of Thrones</em> is over-cooked by now.</p><p>For scifi fans, I&rsquo;d recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal
average &ldquo;ADHD&rdquo; (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama. I guess they&rsquo;ve evolved eyeballs that
can flicker in sync with subtitle display frequency with no conscious mental
effort.</p><h3 id=the-premise><a class=anchor href=#the-premise title='Anchor for: The Premise.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Premise</h3><p>I&rsquo;ll be writing in real-time as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge
of the plot twists.</p><p>I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about
his politics. To summarize, he&rsquo;s a little bit apolitical, but has this weird
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization&mldr;
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI" target=_blank>offended some scifi fans</a>
.
Is <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> really Chinese state propaganda? Whoa!</p><p>But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn&rsquo;t put an author&rsquo;s political
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember <em>The Matrix</em>?</p><p>At worst, dumb-dumb politics ruins the novel immersive experience, so it&rsquo;s
depressing. But I rarely get angry and fumed up about it, no novelist is
perfect, and life is too short to write angry letters to artists telling them
their politics suck.</p><p>I will confess then that I liked the premise of <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em>.
The one-liner &ldquo;Physics does not exist, and never will exist&rdquo; is pretty good.
Why? It is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for
how the heck physics cannot exist!</p><p>In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures,
or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study
of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.</p><p>Newton&rsquo;s Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein&rsquo;s gravity, quantum mechanics &mdash;
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the
interaction of matter and spacetime.</p><p>Hence, and Liu Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the
symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.</p><p>This opens up a panoply of something like a <em>Matrix</em> universe, one that is
programmed and at the whim of the &ldquo;universal programmer&rdquo;. (Wolfram physics
ya nerds! 🤣) I cannot tell if that is where Liu Cixin takes the story, but
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin'.</p><p>Having not yet gotten to the crux of <em>Three Body Problem</em>, I have to insert my
own bit of politics.</p><h2 id=harder-scifi><a class=anchor href=#harder-scifi title='Anchor for: Harder scifi.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Harder scifi</h2><p>I reckon you can take <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em> as poetic allegory. I am
damn sure this is not what Liu Cixin was thinking, but I&rsquo;m telling you this
is one way I can absorb the whole idea looming in <em>Three Body Problem</em>.
Which metaphors then? Well, you can say &ldquo;Capitalism does not exist, and never
will exist&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s almost too comical.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>The way I think of the Marxist counter to capitalism is as a bit of a fantasy.
Neither the capitalists nor the marxists are theorising about reality as far
as I can tell. Their economics does not exist. So I&rsquo;d get my proper poetic
analogy via &ldquo;Economics does not exist&rdquo;.</p><p>As allegory I&rsquo;d take this to mean our economy surely exists (as does matter
and spacetime probably in <em>Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past</em>? Not yet sure!) The
problem is that what <em>economists think</em> economics <em>is</em> is totally unreal.
That&rsquo;d be my poetic take on the <em>Three Body Problem</em> story.</p><p>The only trouble is this is a <em>good</em> thing, whereas in the <em>Three Body Problem</em>
it is supposedly getting teed up as a bad thing? (&ldquo;Physics does not exist&rdquo; is
some sort of incipient war on science or intellectuals in the story?)
In macroeconomics it is a damn good thing the marxists and neoclassicals
preach bogus economics, because no one should ever be forced to live in their
&ldquo;gold is currency&rdquo; and &ldquo;capitalism is revolutionary&rdquo; fantasy universe.</p><p>(Disclosure: I used to think &ldquo;capitalism is the revolutionary force&rdquo; was a
fair enough theory. But a better grasp of neoliberalism has disabused me of
this childish reading of marxism. Neoliberal capitalism has potential to
persist on state life-support forever. F-o-r-e-v-e-r!!! How?
UBI ya&rsquo; sockcuckers! The revolutionary force, if there ever is to be one, has
to be the spiritual capacity of people working together to overthrow tyranny
and injustice. This is not &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; by any definition.)</p><p>This is at least a nice way to enjoy the scifi story, because I am unable to
enjoy it much as a physicist myself. It is too fantastical, so not good
enough hard scifi. I cannot tolerate fantasy literature for long periods.
Short stories with some sort of allegorical moral fable are ok, but the
immersive fantasy literature stuff is to me like reading superhero comics.
A complete waste of my time when I was a kid, like Commodore 64 video games.</p><p>I know adults indulge in these forms of entertainment, and a million people
watch reality TV shows. I just don&rsquo;t understand it &mdash; who has that amount of
free time? Or&mldr; what the heck is wrong with me that I don&rsquo;t have such free
time?</p><p>The reason <em>The Matrix</em> was cool was because you could read it as allegory for
a materialistic society. Even if the Wachowski&rsquo;s did not intend for this to be
the poetic reading. Who has you trapped in the real Matrix? You do. You
and your ego and insatiable desires for material wealth and comforts.
Agent Smith was, all said and done, a human invention. To extract yourself
from the real Matrix you want to recognize what truly matters in your life.
And that&rsquo;d be love and kindness. Waking up from the real Matrix means becoming
a more spiritual person.</p><p>In the macroeconomics/political economy allegory, Agent Smith is something
like the White Supremacist or Neocon or Christian Fascist (they&rsquo;re not
entirely disjoint categories). His &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is rule of the machines. Or not
even that, it is rule by Agent Smith, beyond fascism (the nation is sacred)
to total monarchy (the King is sacred). ((I always shed a tear for my friends
in Thailand at such points in my thought. One nation within which a sizeable
proportion of citizens still has a very unhealthy regard for their
monarch.))</p><p>This leads to the extension of my allegory: humanity in our times is in fact
gripped by the tentacles of an insidious sort of vague ideology. I&rsquo;d call it
neoliberalism, but it goes beyond the narrow meaning of that word. It extends
to the whole plethora of false doctrines in economics, macroeconomics, sociology
and politics that tells us human beings are mere animals and incapable of peace.
The idea is we have to be competitive${}^\dagger$, this is how we survive, we
have to dominate others, and moreover this is bred into us in our DNA&mldr; and
so forth. I will not belabour the whole blackpill nihilist thesis, there are
too many varieties, I&rsquo;m just sketching the cartoon of the idea. However, I
do mean to refer to the real world.</p><p>${}^\dagger$Or, more extreme, the idea we do not have any choice in the
matter, since we have no free will (the idiocy of Sam Harris,
Robert Sapolsky and their like). (First define &ldquo;free will&rdquo; for me bros!))</p><p>It is a pervasive ideology, infecting popular culture and social discourse
everywhere, and it is ruinous for the chances of a decent civilization.
However, unlike nihilists, I believe humanity has the collective capacity to
overcome this narrow dystopian world view. Call me an optimist, a hopeless
romantic, but it is what I believe is possible. Just don&rsquo;t ask me to offer
any probabilities. I&rsquo;d say 100%, but have no clue what the time-frame would
be. Asymptotics is easy, real-time dynamics is hard-to-impossible. But this
is also not the topic of this article today.</p><h2 id=the-farmer-and-the-shooter-hypotheses><a class=anchor href=#the-farmer-and-the-shooter-hypotheses title='Anchor for: The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses</h2><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO:
* The concept in 3BP.
* How it appears in the allegory of modern political 
economy. The hapless Turkey, the Foolish Disk Worlder.
* The dis-analogy of it, and why some allegories are 
made to be motive to overcome the main problem.
</code></pre><p>Maybe I should not waste space expanding on the Turkey and the Flat worlder
metaphors. I think the better point to make is how this sets up a false
dichotomy in the <em>Three Body</em> story. The viewpoint the reader is (supposedly)
drawn to is this binary option: either we are like Turkeys thinking the dawn
brings food every day, oblivious of the catastrophe of Thanks Giving; or we
are Flat Worlders oblivious some 3D entity is toying with our world as if we
were ants, meaning pretty oblivious of our cares and desires.</p><p>Whether you go all Nihilist and pomo, or Nietzsche, in response may indicate
some political persuasion, but I think I am an optimist (talking about our
real world now) because I believe most ordinary people are capable of a more
enlightened world view. The one where human beings might seem insignificant,
but that we are nonetheless amazing creatures. As are any other aliens
civilization in our universe who are sentient and have developed science
and technology.</p><p>The big lie is that sentience is a total accident.</p><p>We might not be Turkeys nor Flat Worlders. At any primitive time in human
history maybe it seems that way, but that&rsquo;s an individualistic attitude,
whereas I can both appreciate the worth of every individual creature, <em>and</em>
imagine collectively life is something special. There is also the point
nihilists should consider, which is that even if life was not special, it
might <em>become</em> special. In my political economy allegory: neoliberalism is
probably a transitory abomination.</p><p>I mean, why would you suppose we are accidents? Of course I know why, and I
maintain a physics and a philosophy blog where I write more about such topics.
But the short version would be we just cannot truly know, and yet we <em>could</em>
very likely be a remarkable species. Being small in the universe does not
equate with insignificance. (Isn&rsquo;t it a &ldquo;very male&rdquo; fallacy to consider size
to be of any importance? Hence, most likely dead wrong? 🤣)</p><p>Size and mass are important for many things of course. But <strong>(a)</strong> get too
massive and you eventually become a useless sucky black hole. <strong>(b)</strong> when
size is not important is of most importance. In the spiritual realm <em>size</em> has
a completely different meaning to anything physical. In the abstract, being
a <em>spiritual giant</em> connotes great wisdom and compassion. In a physical world
where spiritual beings subsist, this sort of size truly does matter. I always
think of the output from mathematics and science to be inexorable companions
of spiritual maturation.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning &mdash; the eco-extremists. I&rsquo;ve never found the
extreme animal rights and eco-extremist people to be very spiritual. They,
like the <em>Three Body</em> character Dr Ye Weinjie, and the even more extreme
Mike Evans and Pan Han characters, have a jaundiced view of humanity. I lump
them (rightly or wrongly) in the same category as Agent Smith in <em>The Matrix</em>.
It&rsquo;d be sad if Liu Cixin was among them, (is he?). Half-way through the book
it looks possible Ye Wenjie will turn to more compassion for humanity. (I guess
it is nice for my depression that I am immersed enough in the book to care for
her character!)</p><p>((Also, I wonder which character is Liu Cixin identifying with as author? Not
that we need to care, but is it Ye Wenjie or Wang Maio &mdash; or the Trisolarian!
that&rsquo;d be funny! 🤣 It is starting to become that sort of story where I care
about the author&rsquo;s views, which is a bad sign. A sign of a poor writer. If it
goes all full Authoritarian Big Daddy mode on us, I doubt I&rsquo;ll get to the 2nd
and 3rd books. Having Mums and Dads is great. But it does not scale. I am
pretty much now locked-in against solution by authoritarian rule&mldr;. even if
it frickin&rsquo; worked!))</p><p>The plot problem is really about how an individual&rsquo;s bitter experience can
lead them to think of all of humanity as evil and irredeemable. It&rsquo;s an
incredibly childish ans self-centred attitude. The truth is, and I think
most people are like this, we can save th animals, save the biosphere, and
also love humanity. These are not contradictory or mutually exclusive
options. To think otherwise is an imbecilic rotten apple fallacy.</p><p>I&rsquo;d go further: the human species is not a cancer or plague, we are a natural
outcome of life on Earth. So maybe have a little compassion for us too, as
well as the swallows?</p><p>By this account (and you have no reason to think I am correct, but I&rsquo;ll state
it anyway) the greater a people are spiritually, the greater will be their
science. The greater will be many of their aspects. Greater in <em>both</em>
abstract spiritual and material advancement awesomeness. Moreover, in such wise
a tiny insignificant creature on a mundane living planet, might reach out to
the stars. IT will not be long in the grand scheme of things before human do
reach the stars. By then, the &ldquo;insignificance&rdquo; of any one human might, I
suppose, be regarded by fools as cause to think our lives have no cosmic
importance, but to the more sagacious and wise it can be true one puny life
has a lot of meaning, by virtue of its tiny insignificant contribution to the
whole.</p><p>As I keep trying to remind some tentatively nihilist MMT friends who give up
on elections for government, no one votes seems to count, but in fact they
all do and that is the power of summation. Addition is a powerful thing.</p><p>I say, give up on political parties &mdash; they are anathema for a decent
society. But do not give up your vote.</p><h2 id=an-excellent-dialogue><a class=anchor href=#an-excellent-dialogue title='Anchor for: An Excellent Dialogue.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>An Excellent Dialogue</h2><p>About half way in to <em>Three Body Problem</em> the protagonist Wang Miao asks
the venerable and gentle Dr Ye Wenjie about &ldquo;physics does not exist&rdquo;.
She answers that it is not that physics does not exist, but that what we think
is physics is wrong.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the spin the Netflix adaptation will have on this, nor am I sure
how this remark will play out in the original novels, but it is a crux&mldr; for
me at least, worth writing about&mldr; and with my allegorical interpretation too.</p><p>Ye Wenjie likens scientists now to the Church of old, who thought Copernicus
as guilty of heresy, Bruno and d&rsquo;Ascoli worth the stake, and Galileo worth
the Spanish Inquisition. Or she says, &ldquo;Maybe we are like the Church.&rdquo; Meaning
with respect to today&rsquo;s scientific apostates.</p><p>It is a lot less dramatic for physics these days though, than it is for
political economy, since physics base marble is in pretty close contact with
us now though particle accelerators and cosmology, and quantum computing of
course (very base level, since the QC&rsquo;s are exploiting entanglement).
Entanglement is the base marble of our universe, and perhaps it is no
accident Schrödinger&rsquo;s Cat gets a mention in the immediately preceding scene
with the detective Shi Qiang.</p><p>We are nowhere near the base marble of economics, but MMT is part of the base.
A huge gap remains in orthodox and even MMT-inspired political economy, and
that is the spiritual realm, and I&rsquo;ve not encountered any professional
economists who even dare acknowledge this yet &mdash; maybe there are a few like
Kate Raworth or Jason Hickel, but I do not really know for sure, are they
merely acting ethically because they think it good for themselves, or do
they realize spiritual principles are at the very heart of true economics?</p><p>Not just ecological principles, but spiritual principles.
I suspect they do not acknowledge. They place the ecology ahead as primary,
but this is a grave mistake, because we cannot have a sound ecosystem by just
asserting ecology is important. Spiritual prerequisites are needed, even if
only at a bare minimum level of political recognition that the ecological
economics importance is something worth caring about.</p><p>If your economists do not care about ecology then nothing wil be done
politically. The ecological economics academics can scream their heads off,
it will only be when people dying is a clear consequence of ignorance of
ecology that politicians will lift a finger to dial the ecologists and invite
them to the table. Too late. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to play out that way.
If people can learn spiritual principles are more important even than ecology,
then there is hope of avoiding catastrophe. I know it is a hard ask for a
realist, even harder for a dumb-dumb materialist, but you&rsquo;ve got to ask.</p><p>((At this point through reading 3BP, I am certainly worried (for my
entertainment pleasure) that Liu Cixin might head towards blackpill
nihilism. I hope that&rsquo;s not the case. Getting immersed into a story
is a wonderful form of entertainment, but if the bubble is shattered it&rsquo;s
kinda&rsquo; depressing, which defeats the purpose.))</p><p>Interestingly, although I am not close friends with Warren Mosler, I think he
has a moral component to his work over the decades on what became MMT. He has
always said he talks to anyone in power or schools or the general public who
is listening, out of a sense of public duty and moral obligation. Few other
economists teach from this motive. They teach from textbooks for a paycheck
and academic career. They have no idea at least 25% of what they teach is
nonsense, and in fact unethical. If you know this, what are you teaching for?</p><p>Never teach for a paycheck.</p><p>Expect a paycheck, but don&rsquo;t let that be the reason you teach. OK, I do not
personally know a lot of economics teachers, I&rsquo;m just guessing, but prove me
wrong! Can it be that they are not teaching economics for a pay check and
yet refuse to inquire into the fundamental truths of the subject?
What I do know is that Mosler at least does not do it for any income. He is
pure. But, of course, considered a crank and heretic by mainstream economists,
of all persuasions, post-keynesians, marxists, new Keynesians and
neoclassical alike. Warren Mosler is a Copernicus of our times. It is
lucky Stephanie Kelton has not yet been burned at the metaphorical stake.
You could say Steve Keen was the one burned at the stake, but like you&rsquo;d
expect for an Aussie, he survived the ordeal and only increased his cuss word
frequency.</p><h3 id=blackpill-versus-pomo><a class=anchor href=#blackpill-versus-pomo title='Anchor for: Blackpill versus Pomo.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Blackpill versus Pomo</h3><p>About the pill colours. They come from the red-pill/blue-=pill choice in <em>The Matrix</em>.

journeys and a necessary jumping-off point for these various ideologies. In

because my more casual use of &ldquo;blackpill&rdquo; refers merely to
<em>general hopelessness</em> and lack of hope for humanity generally, and my usage
has nothing to do with misogyny. The point to &ldquo;pilling&rdquo; is that it is a
conscious free willed <em>choice</em>.</p><p>My other point is that if we sanely examine the evidence for and against
humanity, there is no reason to become nihilistic. Humans do good things and
bad things. We do not have to solve the three body problem for redemption.
We only need to treat each other with kindness and forgiveness, but the other
side to Justice is to not allow people who wish to do harm to harm others.
In other words, becoming a more spiritual person is a process, one that cannot
be perfected, but which can be acquired in ever greater measure, and one
measure is not to sit idly by while other people inflict needless harm upon
others. But also, not to be a dick about this and go all fascist and
over-protective of your ideals or children. Kindness and love cannot be imposed
by external force. The greater force comes from within, and &mdash; call me a
wide-eyed optimist &mdash; everyone has such capacity. We need to help each
other exercise such inner force.</p><p>The thing is, this is easy to do. Patience and forbearance are arts for
sure, but being able to roughly doodle in this form of art does wonders, you
don&rsquo;t need to be a compassion and mercy Rembrandt to do a lot of good in the

In the TV series you see these little red ants from time to time, with
heavy cinematic significance.</p><p>Are the Trisolarans the red ant things? You know, I think they are. Or maybe
not, a McGuffin?</p><p>Have to say of the TV adaptation, the world Central Command gang are freakin&rsquo;
bad actors. It is pretty hilarious. Oh yeah, Chinese State propaganda! 🤣 (I
can believe it in this case.)</p><p>On this issue&mldr; I&rsquo;ve watched plenty of action movies, superhero, Marvel,
Batman, Superman, stuff in my life to to know &ldquo;state propaganda&rdquo; is pervasive
and relative.</p><p>Half the time Holly wood probably does not know it is doing propaganda, It&rsquo;s
like Noam Chomsky used to say, you do not have to believe you are a
propagandists to be doing propaganda, more likely you&rsquo;re self-selected. Only
natural born establishment shills get promoted to high rank in mainstream
media.</p><p>Still, I kind of preferred the 1960&rsquo;s era depictions in <em>Three Body</em>.</p><p>Modern China is an incredible country, bustling with dynamism (and the
pollution it comes with). It is super modern. But there is no excuse for
shoddy acting when depicting the international governmental crowd, and what&rsquo;s
with all the military regalia? 🤣 Hilarious stuff. Seriously dude, I honestly
think it is for comic effect, could it not be? I guess it might not be, so
then it is even more hilarious. Spoils the scifi entertainment aspect
though. Pity.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure this can be made a critique of Liu Cixin&rsquo;s literary style, but
in fact there are some plot points and dialogues (albeit in English
translation) that seem pretty cringe. I skip over that speed-reading if
I can. But much the same in <em>Dune</em> and <em>The Expanse</em> novels. You have to know
when to speed read and when to slow down to enjoy sub-genius literature.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like in movies, suspension of disbelief. Only in literature I don&rsquo;t know
the analogous phrase. It should not be a thing, but in a lot of scifi
literature it is, sadly.</p><p>There is a lot of other funny stuff in the TV adaptation that makes it a bit
too hilarious to get immersed not as serious scifi. Too many to bother
mentioning, use of stock footage, a lot of characters stereotyped, and then
the symbol of the ETO &mdash; a clear upside down Freemason symbol.
What&rsquo;s that about? The romantic cinematic scenes started to get a bit trite
too, although I like the slowish pace they introduce. I&rsquo;m only watching and
reading along because I&rsquo;m very depressed at the moment. Been a hard few
weeks on top of a hard few months on top of a hard five years after five

propaganda! No, seriously. It is funny. I liked the way they depicted
Ye Wenjie&rsquo;s discovery of radiation boundaries inside the Sun, these are
regions where the frequencies of emission sharply drop, in-between boundaries
the fall off in frequency is gradual, a power law presumably.</p><p>((There are in fact boundary layers in the Sun and stars, but I believe they
are more like conventional magnetohydrodynamic boundaries. In
<em>Three Body Problem</em> Liu Cixin has to invent a nice little fantasy physics
into the story to get the million-fold magnification of microwave
transmissions he needs. But it is a cool soft scifi plot device. <em>J&rsquo;approuve</em>.&rsquo;))</p><p>The comedy angle is the TV series depicts Ye Wenjie&rsquo;s thesis as a stair case
profile of frequencies. They should have used a power law fall off with
boundary zones instead. Just for the <em>cool</em> factor. But&mldr; ya know&mldr; the
comedy is only for the learned. Although it&rsquo;d be a nice little sociological
experiment to survey how many ordinary TV watchers realized the staircase
profile was a bit fishy. School teachers take note! Try it on your students.</p><p>Come to think of it, this is the really serious good of shows like
<em>Three Body</em>. They make some excellent school teaching resources for discussion.</p><p>From bitter experience I&rsquo;ve learn the &ldquo;physics of scifi&rdquo; lessons are not good
in school that have a national standards examination focus. But for younger
and older kids (50 years +, or under 12 years) these fantasy resources make
nice motivation for informal discussion and &ldquo;college dorm room&rdquo; banter.</p><h2 id=suspended-judgment><a class=anchor href=#suspended-judgment title='Anchor for: Suspended Judgment.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Suspended Judgment</h2><p>There&rsquo;s little point ruining a fantasy scifi story with realist gripes. However,
I can make an exception when you put characters and actors in entertainment
jeopardy &mdash; by which I mean painting them histrionically. It ruins the pure
entertainment experience, at least for us hard scifi art snobs. This is what
Liu Cixin seemed to have to contrive.</p><p>Here is what I mean. Imagine the scenario of <em>begin confronted with outright
miracles</em> was a thing, and was presented only to a few top scientists. What
would be their response? It would not be to commit suicide. Did Liu Cixin
really need to make the story about physicist suicides? It think that was
unnecessary for the plot. Most physicists I know would be intrigued, and
first would look to counsel one another to check not everyone was going
insane. Science just is not done in such isolation as portrayed in
<em>Three Body Problem</em>. And it did not have to be written that way. The
crisis could have been instead sheer confusion among the physicists. It&rsquo;d
be far more natural that the physicists would get together. There is the
Frontier of Science group in the story, who are a bit mystical &mdash; and I
think that will be integral to the plot later (probably aliens?). But a
more sedate and investigative world committee of physicists exploring the
miracles would have been equally as compelling a story, more interesting,
and more realistic.</p><p>((Note: the Netflix version might be different, I do not know.))</p><p>Liu Cixin did get it right mostly though, where it mattered, because he had
the one anti-hero, Wang Miao, respond to the miracles realistically. That was
incredibly important for me to stick with the book. Wang Miao realized the
miracle of the <em>countdown</em> was subjective, and that means the laws of physics are
not really vamoosed. It allowed the character to find empathy and friendship with
the desultory and roughish, but ultimately loveable, detective Shi Qiang.</p><p>Yes, the response of a realistic community of physicists would in our real
world been more like Wang Maio&rsquo;s response, but then i guess a few plot turns
in <em>Three Body Problem</em> might not be &ldquo;available&rdquo;. Too bad I say. Eliminate
them! Make the story more believable. It would be a better work of art. As
it stands, Remembrance of Earth&rsquo;s Past is probably a scifi classic, but not
reaching the level of literary epic. I will probably still finish the trilogy.
Stay tuned them for more on the 3BP allegory.</p><p>The real gripe I have here is a very general critique of all literature and
movies when it comes to heros. If you have a single character as the hero or
anti-hero your story is, I am afraid to say, not realistic. But there is no
need to write a novel this way, with a main central protagonist/heroine/hero.</p><p>The same trope ruined <em>The Expanse</em> &mdash; although I loved those books too, to
me, just subjectively, they were epic, although not great literature.</p><p>Does Iain Banks write form a more humanistic perspective? Ursula LeGuin? If
they have I&rsquo;ve not heard of the novels.</p><div style=text-align:center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

adaptation. It depicts our solar system living within a larger cosmos, as if
our entire universe was sitting inside the tip of a piece of carbon nanotube.
A similar concept is put to more comedic purposes in the

overall scale of things. So we could magnify everything up by a googol-fold
and no one should notice the difference. It is an approximate symmetry in
some areas of physics, notably electromagnetism and some string theory
models.</p><p>It also is a symmetry that probably holds for time scales in our universe
close to our so-called Big Bang. In fact, some cosmologists &mdash; notably
Neil Turok and Latham Boyle &mdash; believe (and can show with their math) that a
whole lot of particle physics makes a whole lot more sense if our universe had
an exact conformal symmetry at the Big Bang. If it did, then there is little
need to explain where the Big Bang came from, since the supposed singularity
at our conformal time $\tau=0$ would not truly exist, it&rsquo;d be a reflection
symmetry boundary. In a 4D Block universe conception of Nature this says
that nothing came before the Big Bang, and the origin of our universe is
then something more global.</p><p>Whatever put us all here, put the whole 4D thing here, all at once,
so-to-speak. Or at least implicitly, since nothing exists on the other side
of a mirror. Nothing exists on the other side of our Big Bang. (Some people
like to think there is an actual Mirror universe on the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; &mdash; but
a reflection reflects, it does not transmit. Just sayin&rsquo;.)</p><p>If you prefer a cosmology where a universe does exist through a conformal
symmetry boundary then Roger Penrose has a Conformal Cyclic Cosmology for
you to work on, but it is by far the harder physics to get right, and is
probably wrong.</p><p>There is however a hybrid of Turok&ndash;Boyle and Penrose, due to Anthony Lasenby
and colleagues, which is that a far future conformal symmetry could possibly
be &ldquo;lived thorough&rdquo; (for elementary particles, not biological life) but the
universe on the other side would be time reflected with respect to ours. That&rsquo;s
a wild one to wrap your head around, but &ldquo;follow the math&rdquo;. It is not illogical
nor inconceivable.</p><p>Since this is not my physics blog, I think I will leave this topic here.
I cannot quite turn it to useful allegory.</p><h2 id=redemptionists-versus-adventists><a class=anchor href=#redemptionists-versus-adventists title='Anchor for: Redemptionists versus Adventists.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Redemptionists versus Adventists</h2><p>Oh no! No, no! The story got too stupid for me. The factions loyal to &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;
(the advanced alien civilization) start doing the whole anti-religious
thing (meaning pseudo-religious zealot ideological thing). I thought I&rsquo;d
make it through to the end of <em>Three Body Problem</em>, but it has become too
cringe.</p><p>However, there is something to be recovered in my allegory. It is true that
in MMT circles there are factions. Some MMT advocates are capitalists, some
socialist, and a mix in-between, I guess some might be quasi-libertarians,
and there are plenty of liberals. However, I do not see <em>Three Body Problem</em>
being of more use for my allegory. Using scifi as allegory was a nice game
worth paying while it lasted today.</p><p>I still do not think the book is Chinese State propaganda, but the TV series
has enough weird actors playing the international community (they appear to be
amateur actors) that it sort of ruins the feel of the TV series. The
cinematography is good for a TV/streaming budget, but I got a bit tired
sucking in the cringe on many aspects of the production, eventually.</p><p>I am guessing the Netflix version will be cringe in another way, the way
<em>Game of Thrones</em> became. But I&rsquo;ll have a look at it next year maybe, just in
case they do something different with the whole aliens as &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; plot. Change
that up into something realistic and more hard scifi and it could be very good
entertainment.</p><h3 id=conflict-theory><a class=anchor href=#conflict-theory title='Anchor for: Conflict Theory.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Conflict Theory</h3><p>OK, I&rsquo;m being too sensitive. For sure, history teaches us humans tend to get
into ideological conflict when there is uncertainty. So it is not at all
unrealistic that the ETO in <em>Three Body</em> would splinter into factions. This
fits with plenty of allegories, as I just mentioned. I will suck-it-up then
and continue reading.</p><p>However, I do like my scifi more when the super-powerful aliens are ethical.
Why would they not be?</p><p>The worst dis-analogy people have about this is getting reflected in
contemporary society in the form of the fear of Ai superintelligence. The idea
is supertintelligent Ai might treat the human species as ants. This is
laughable. It is an idea based on a false analogy. (The analogy is how humans
treat actual ants.)</p><p>There are many flaws in the analogy, but the biggest is that a
superintelligence will conform to <em>our</em> pretend analogies! Another is the
idea hierarchies of intelligence will recapitulate (a fractal sociology
notion. There is no justification for this thesis.</p><p>In fact, I am pretty cynical about the Ai tech industry. I think they are
capable, even innocently, of drumming up fear of an Ai singularity just to
fuel their research. I call it Nerd Capitalism.</p><p>But heck, better to fund the nerds than the Military, I say.</p><p>The think about Nick Bostrom, Connor whatshisname, whatshisname Eliezer, and
whatshisname Hinton
&mdash; all the Ai Singularity fear-mongers &mdash; is that their inferences are bogus.
But why? Can I prove they are wrong?</p><p>No, I cannot prove they are wrong. We just cannot well-predict the future.
The problem here is one of probability theory. The Ai nerds want you to
believe their doom prognostications are 95% confident bands, or whatever.</p><p>The truth is, they have no idea what the error bands are for their doom
predictions and nightmare scenarios. No one does.</p><p>If pressed on this, some of them will say, &ldquo;Yeah, but prepare for the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>OK.</p><p>What is the worst case scenario though?</p><p>Once again, they have no idea. They have worst case nightmares and dreams,
but so do I, and mine are not the same as theirs. Who is to say whose
nightmares are more realistic?</p><p>My claim would be what we fundamentally have to deal with politically and
globally is an ethical macroeconomics, a spiritual economics, and a fair go
for all people. It has nothing to do with Ai. Ai can be used as a tool to
emancipate the working class, but it is only a tool. This means dismantling
old power structures and replacing them with power and authority that serves
the interests of the poorest. For the poor did not get a vote in determining
their condition.</p><h3 id=nihilism><a class=anchor href=#nihilism title='Anchor for: Nihilism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Nihilism</h3><p>I do &ldquo;get&rdquo; the strong theme of nihilism in *<em>THree Body</em>./ Humans suck.</p><p>But it is a prejudice of our times.

To be wise one needs to weight such extremes. Although I&rsquo;m no anthropologist,
I would suspect if we weight the acts people do, and have done, overall the
human species is truly marvellous and wonderful.</p><p>It is however a fair enough plot device to sue. Because a few cynics can
certainly spoiled things for millions. I&rsquo;ll thus be interested in reading on
to see where Liu Cixin takes this. But it could get boring, and tell us more
about Liu Cixin&rsquo;s blinkered view of humanity than about what he could have
learned from life and reflected in his scifi art.</p><h3 id=redemptionists><a class=anchor href=#redemptionists title='Anchor for: Redemptionists.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Redemptionists</h3><p>(Oh, anti-puniness.)</p><p>Man oh man! The Redemptionists in the story get a terrible treatment. Avoiding
spoilers, here I want to comment on the bit of modern fable that Liu Cixin
draws upon for his plot. It is the idea that humans are puny, insignificant
and un-special.</p><p>I actually find this laughable. But understandable, And so also a crux.
I&rsquo;ll try to explain.</p><p>Firstly the capacity we have to see ourselves as either special or
insignificant is pretty significant. It&rsquo;s not a paradox, since the &ldquo;out&rdquo; is
clearly that we are special. Any creature that gains sentient subjective
consciousness knows it is special, and it is ignorance of physics to fail to
see this. People who think humans are just highly evolved apes are missing
everything&mldr; shall I be fair and say they are missing nearly everything.</p><p>Secondly, I take the Copernican Principle seriously: this is the idea that
it&rsquo;s not a good idea to think you are the centre of the universe. Clearly
humans are not centres of the universe. However, this does not logically lead
to the conclusion we are insignificant. It just means we are not the centre.
Of course &ldquo;centre&rdquo; here means the &ldquo;be all and end all&rdquo; as well as the
scientific notion that the cosmos does not have a privileged status for any
one observer or plant. It is a key principle of modern science. As I
explained before, it&rsquo;s about symmetry principles and invariants, these are
what define physics.</p><p>But again, this refutes the nihilist thesis, because the very fact human
civilization has proven capable of discovering the principle of physics
(and so much more at higher levels of organization) implies again, we are
highly significant creatures. Don&rsquo;t write us off you mad Adventists!</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to write an essay on this, so I&rsquo;ll mention just a third and fourth
point for now (I can think of many more). The third is the simplistic idea
the universe is so damn vast, and the Earth is so damn small, so we literally
are insignificant. This is the most laughable. It does not even bare a
mention, but I feel I must mention it for some weaker minds. The point is,
ruler and clock scale is not a great metric for &ldquo;significance&rdquo;.</p><p>There is no telling what human civilization will become capable of, and so
concluding right now that we are puny and insignificant is pretty insane.</p><p>Lastly, the fourth: you should consider that humans on Earth might
in fact advance in future to something like the fictional Trisolarian
technical advancement. We&rsquo;d be the &ldquo;Lords&rdquo; perhaps top some other &ldquo;backwards&rdquo;
planetary civilization. This despite not having the harshness of Trisolaris
to cut our technological teeth upon &mdash; and that&rsquo;s a fantastical plot device
to be sure &mdash; ultracapitalism or ultradarwinism! 🤣)</p><p>There is more to say on this fourth principle of non-significance. It
has relevance to current debates about Ai Singularity. The idea is we&rsquo;d better
be careful in developing Ai because it might over-run uis and treat humans like
we treat ants. This is laughable. It is a false inference and a terribly
childish dis-analogy. For one thing, humans so not have to go around treading
on ants and digging up insects with no concern or compassion. We mess with the
Earth knowing the insects are <em>likely</em> not conscious. Whereas a hypothetical
Trisolairan civilization would damn well for sure know humans were sentient.
Would you believe an advanced alien race to treat humans like ants? No!
They&rsquo;d treat us like&mldr;b humans. What that means is impossible for us to say,
because we have nothing relevant to infer from.</p><p>The idea humans are to ants and Trisolarians are to humans is a false analogy.
It applies only in some intellectual sense, not in a spiritual sense. Certainly
not in a political or colonialist/imperialist sense. Ants do not have any
politics, and have no companions they love and are willing to die for, they
just die for their colony by instinct. Their sociology is also blind and
instinctual, and we talk about &ldquo;ant society&rdquo; by imposing our language on
the situation, but it is a very different category to human society. Any
analogies here are highly fraught with ample scope for error and stupid
reasoning (lobster hierarchy!). This topic is probably worth an essay for
idiot philosophers, if I had nothing better to do, but I do, so no essay.</p><p>Oh damn&mldr; I cannot resist a fifth: another source of nihilism and feelings
of insignificance is the individualistic mindset. Sure my friend, <em>You</em> might
be insignificant, but human civilization need not be so. But I would go
further. But only because I have a few other metaphysical suspensions. I am
one of those who think consciousness indicates we are not physical creatures.
But we live in a physical world. If you can put those tow thoughts together
in a constructive way then you will get the idea, I won&rsquo;t need to elaborate.
In any case, it is the most powerful sort of evidence that we are not
insignificant puny creatures, but rather in some sense the cosmos was made
for us (and any other sentient civilizations). Being dropped into such a
vast cosmos is of course humbling, but I think that is entirely part of the
point of it! If only you can understand!</p><p>Puniness is contextual.</p><p>You hopefully can see where I am going with my macroeconomics and political
economy allegory!</p><p>We cannot say the past understanding of neoclassical macroeconomics means
doom for socialism or a decent society. We would need to know what an advanced
level of political comprehension will do for humanity, and you never know,
in 15 or 20 years we might be doing wonders. Or maybe it&rsquo;ll take great
catastrophe, so a century or more outlook. In any case, we today cannot
comprehend how political economy will evolve, and there is thus no cause for
doom and gloom. There is incredible cause for fear and regret, but not for
doom and gloom. In fact does it not imply the eternal optimist is the
preferred stance? The wiser stance? I think so.</p><p>Doom and gloom are in fact neoclassical attitudes themselves. Stuck-in-a-rut
attitudes. No capacity to think dynamically. There is a big irony there,
since aren&rsquo;t neoclassicals the big boosters of the dynamo of capitalism?'</p><p>Listen you guys, a dynamo that can only swirl about and equilibrium is no
creative thing. You shouldn&rsquo;&rsquo;t want neoclassical economics even if it were
true.</p><h3 id=authorial-insertion><a class=anchor href=#authorial-insertion title='Anchor for: Authorial Insertion.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Authorial Insertion</h3><p>About two-third the way through the first book. I find myself caring about
the author now, which is a bad sign for enjoying the story. I don&rsquo;t want the
story going down the paternal Alien overlord route. Not only is it sucky
scifi, it starts to seem like betraying the author&rsquo;s motives.</p><p><strong>Spoiler:</strong><br>It is quite an audacious piece of writing to have the main character,
Ye Wenjie, push a button on the microwave transmitter to send a message
of &ldquo;Come please rule over us!&rdquo; just after reading the first ever alien
contact message: &ldquo;Please do not communicate! I&rsquo;m a pacifist among my people
and we will invade you. Please to not communicate!&rdquo;</p><p>Cixin tries to motivate this via an alienation among humans, and the
loneliness of Ye Wenjie. But I find that character sketch unbelievable. A real
life Ye Wenjie would probably not betray the entire human race like that!
The plot seem far more symptomatic of Liu Cixin&rsquo;s pessimism than of a good
well written story. I know I&rsquo;m only reading a translation&mldr; but still!!</p><p>Let me emphasize, it is not a bad scifi fantasy to read, it gives me this
grist to write! I just wish it were not so cringe.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll tell you one of the arts of genius writing: you don&rsquo;t need a terrific
vocabulary nor amazing descriptive prowess, but you do need sympathy for your
reader. (Unless you are James Joyce &mdash; genius by an entirely other means,
so genius I can&rsquo;t get through one of his books, I&rsquo;d rather spend time
reading mathematical physics. 🤣)</p><h3 id=the-crud-of-advanced-aliens><a class=anchor href=#the-crud-of-advanced-aliens title='Anchor for: The Crud of Advanced Aliens.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Crud of Advanced Aliens</h3><p>It&rsquo;s the same trouble with superheros. If you do not build-in flaws and
fallibility, then your advanced alien species that regards humans as puny
insects is an unbelievable story. Lower than soft scifi, it becomes just
fantasy novel. I have no time for reading fantasy novels.</p><p>The Trisolarians have no need to invade the Earth. They&rsquo;d be a spiritual
species. To write the story as if they want to wipe out humanity because to
them we are insects is thoroughly unbelievable, and it seriously gives me the
urge to quit reading the book. It&rsquo;s Liu Cixin now who needs to redeem himself.
I hate it when books turn this way onto the author&rsquo;s view. But in this case,
it is so bad, &lsquo;cos I <em>wanted</em> it to be harder scifi, so what am I gonna do?
(I know, I know, I should not <em>want</em> so much.)</p><p>Such superpower stories lean on the fallacy I mentioned previously: namely
that social hierarchy scales to sentient species hierarchy.</p><p>Wrong! So badly wrong. It cannot scale.</p><p>Once a civilization is at a human level of advancement, it is capable of
regarding and recognizing other intelligent species as worthy of giving care.
It is not even that it is irrational not to assume a higher
species would recognize a lesser sentient species, but that the spiritual
faculty we know we all have would be somehow less advanced in the powerful
alien species? Why would that be so? The far more realistic case would be
the opposite. They&rsquo;d be more peaceful and spiritual than us, not less, and by
a long way.</p><p>Pre-21st Century Scifi writers are not &ldquo;getting&rdquo; this. I mean, the whole
dystopian thing and space war thing is a terrible prejudice of our times.
<em>Star Wars</em> is literally children&rsquo;s entertainment fodder. Yeah, I loved
<em>Star Wars</em> as a kid, it was our generation&rsquo;s <em>The Matrix</em>. But a grown-up can
be a little more mature and learn to respect more serious scifi space opera,
which is incredibly rare, and so all the more delicious when found.</p><p>Even the <em>Red Mars</em> series by Kim Stanley Robinson was a bit too militaristic
for my taste. OK, it was clearly allegory and <em>cautionary tale</em> but it still
could have been more spiritual. To write of the future in a spiritual way is
tough, I &ldquo;get&rdquo; that! But I wish more scifi authors would try.</p><p>It is a greater art to write tension and intrigue without childish baby
militarism. But let&rsquo;s face it, humanity is at an adolescent stage in history,
so most people cannot see what the adult futuristic scifi could be. If I wrote
the novel of this kind it would likely flop. Maybe Ursula LeGuin wrote a few
of the kind I would admire, but so far I&rsquo;ve only read a couple of her books,
and they seemed to me to have a bit of a &ldquo;humans are stupid&rdquo; and
&ldquo;war is inevitable&rdquo; vibe to them t🤣oo.</p><h2 id=two-proton-theory><a class=anchor href=#two-proton-theory title='Anchor for: Two Proton Theory.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Two Proton Theory</h2><p><strong>Spoiler:</strong><br>The fun stuff blogging about scifi in real-time. How are the Trisolarians
using two protons to &ldquo;shut down human science&rdquo;? I am guessing it&rsquo;ll be
entanglement, so quantum teleportation. It&rsquo;s soft scifi because you cannot
exploit teleportation without first going to the other end of your entangled
system at conventional sub-luminal speed. I guess the 7-dimensional string
theory space, the Calabi-Yau manifold, will come into play too, but I cannot
see how that swings the plot to permit a disruption of human science over
400 years!</p><p>Trouble is, for a physicist, this is enough of a carrot to keep you reading a
bad novel.</p><p><strong>Spoilers:</strong><br>OK, I read through to where the <em>sophons</em> are explained.
Superstring theory! 🤣 Protons being &ldquo;unfolded&rdquo; so that one of the
6 Calabi-Yau compactified dimensions becomes macroscopic. It was disappointing
that this plot device was used to then etch computer logic arrays onto the
enlarged dimension, turning the single proton into a supercomputer. Once a
Calibi-Yau dimension is enlarged there is nothing but vacuum to &ldquo;write&rdquo; or
&ldquo;etch&rdquo; upon. If you engineer some other actual membrane to write information
on then it will no longer be a proton, by definition. In particular it could
not then be recompressed back down the small superstring dimensions. Besides
which, the proton is not a compactified object, it is a composite of strings
(three constantly mixing quarks and an ephemeral sea of gluons &mdash; these are
what you might &ldquo;unpack&rdquo; into large extra dimensions)
So this was highly cringe for a reading physicist wanting some decent
entertainment.</p><p>There have to be dozens of better ways to scifi imagine a stealth
supercomputer carrying an Ai program as a weapon against Earth. I would
probably go for nanobots that can assemble to mimic a natural biological
species, like an ant. ^he processing could be done partly remote, using
entangled Bell pairs, and all the ant would need to do would be to receive
radio signals for the quantum teleportation decoding. (A quantum teleport is
not possible at faster-then-light speed. The receiver needs to be sent an
instruction via normal space channels.) Having such realistic constraints is
good for a scifi writer.</p><p>Though, I admit, to the fantacists these would be nowhere near as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as
Liu Cixin&rsquo;s sophons. The sophon is an incredibly scary scifi invention, one
of my favourite horrors now (if we are talking pure fantasy,
I can appreciate good fantasy, I just do not like it inserted into scifi).</p><p>I am not so sure about the Trisolarians having brains that emit
electromagnetic waves that betray all their thoughts, so they cannot lie or
deceive. That one came as a shock. I am sure Liu Cixin thought he needs it
for novelty or some plot turn, but again, it is too big a stretch for scifi.
Why not stick a Magneto (Erik Lehnsherr) helmet on to shield your thinking?
You cannot write serious scifi and tell me no Trisolarian would think of
this. Nor that their evolution would not have had to go through a period where
their brains were not so luminous. As I said, cringe.</p><p>Worrisome, since as goes the scifi cringe, so probably goes the sociology and
political cringe. I cannot see the second novel, <em>The Dark Forest</em> going well
for a reader like myself.</p><p>However, I did like the way detective Shi Qiang ended the first novel (not the
horrific nano flying knife slicing of the oil tanker, but the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; bit.)
some hope for the optimistic reader, reading scifi for imagination and
creative reflection upon our future, amidst too much stupid nihilism.</p><p>It was interesting Cixin wrote the character Ye Wenjie as one who thought
advanced aliens would almost surely have to be spiritual (kind, compassionate,
peaceful). In the afterword it seems clear Liu Cixin himself thinks the
opposite, so he has a terrible sense of social consciousness I feel.
What a dick. (Hey&mldr; my informed opinion is all!) He should not have written
the afterword, it ruined the whole reading experience. The author
sometimes needs to stfu. Same problem with Frank Herbert. A good example of
an author who stays quiet better would be William Gibson. I don&rsquo;t quite
know why, but for me, subjectively, it should be the same problem for
Ursula LeGuin, but I don&rsquo;t <em>always</em> get the same cringe from her books.
I&rsquo;m not saying authors cannot have afterwords for their novels, I am just
saying I was unfortunate to bother reading this one. However, it is not all
bad, Liu Cixin seems to be sympathetic to environmentalism and greater unity
among the people of the Earth. His atrocious political beliefs are concerning
non-existent aliens. Not that I think extraterrestrials do not exist, I think
they do, but it is childish to believe in the Mathers theory (the fictional
RAND author character) that they&rsquo;d be hostile or would be a source of conflict
among humans simply by the symbolic event of a First Contact, or monopolization
of knowledge potentially gained from an advanced alien species.</p><p>(Kind of makes you hope the other guys had Star Trek and the
Prime Directive.)</p><p>There is a more balanced view of CETI (communication with extraterrestiral intelligence) in a Cold War context you can get here:
<a href=https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/7e186d38-914c-4175-bd0c-d9501279dd98/content target=_blank>“Mixed Signals Communication with the Alien in Cold War Radio Astronomy”</a>
by Rebecca Charbonneau. She actually discusses
<em>Three Body Problem</em>. I did not read it all, since it is irrelevant now the
Cold War is over, but her thesis mostly concerned historical analysis of the
Cold War politics, not future ET contact.</p><p>I suspect some of the fictional BIll Mather theory might be applicable
should ET contact just one person or nation tomorrow. (Why would they?)</p><p>OK, Liu Cixin portrays a scenario why they might! That&rsquo;s the fun of the
scifi.</p><p>((Alos, who knows, maybe Liu Cixin <em>was</em> influenced by some RAND lunatic. A lot
of stuff that came out of RAND was laughable Neocon foolery,
unfortunately cloaked in a lot of serious intent and taken seriously by
the neoliberals and, it seems, by Liu Cixin. RAND also had plenty of
intellectual firepower to lend the air of distinguished scholarship. A lot of
what came out of RAND was also very good analysis. But if you are a reader
of RAND reports, and a user, it is your duty to conduct due diligence and weed
out the wheat from the chaff.))</p><p>Fans of Liu Cixin should not be upset and flame me, these are just my
personal opinions, so don&rsquo;t hate me for them. I am not saying he wrote

was militaristic, nor great literature. The answer, for me, is that
<em>The Expanse</em> had the heroes and heroine&rsquo;s, and collective insanity
(the Martian faction) but overall it portrayed humans as decent, united when
they realized they needed to be, and it this was good. But also it was a
detective story which stayed true to the genre to the end. <em>SciFi</em> was
essentially (or at least subjectively to me) <em>the</em> McGuffin of <em>The Expanse</em>.
The greatest McGuffin I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed so far.</p><p>I tolerated a few others, there was a Starz series,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_%28TV_series%29 target=_blank>“Counterpart”</a>
based
around a parallel world tunnel, and the German production <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_%28TV_series%29 target=_blank>“Dark”</a>
with a nuclear power station mishap
turned time travel portal (a German series based around a fictional town of
Winden). They were watchable. Today I am having more fun writing this article
than reading the novel, so another

for me, unless used for comedy. Parallel Worlds are no good either, but
that&rsquo;s a bias I have from my own physics research preferences. So if anyone
thinks there is scifi entertainment better then <em>The Expanse</em> please tell me.
