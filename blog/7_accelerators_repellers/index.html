dynamical systems ideas underlying macroeconomics. Our focus is on macro and
mesoeconomics. So we are <strong><em>not</em></strong> interested in particular stock prices, or even
sectors, we are interested in the main aggregated market indices
(in the USA the SPX, NASDAQ and whatever). This is partly pragmatic.
If you liken the economic system to the weather and climate, the climate is very
predictable (highly macro) the weather is not (too micro).</p><p>Whenever you see such qualitative level distinctions, you know you are dealing with a
dynamical system with so-called <em>emergent</em> properties, and top-down causations. A
purely bottom-up system that admits a reductionistic description can always be
modelled using micro-casual analysis &mdash; with enough compute power. A genuine
top-down controlled system does not admit such analysis. But most dynamical systems
are not entirely top-down. And the economy of a large nation is such a hybrid system,
it has micro-causal and macro-causal responses and feedbacks, so also involves
potential for useful mesoscopic analysis.</p><p>((For the philosophers: genuine top-down causation is impossible in classical physics, and so is considered impossible in economics, because the economic system is considered to not be sensitive to quantum mechanics. But this is incredibly naïve and foolish. There is a stupid dumb way you can see it is foolish at a very basic level, because all the computers running the modern fintec systems and nanosecond trading algorithms absolutely must rely upon quantum mechanics, because their transistors cannot function otherwise. But this is stupid because the transistors are a mere means to a classical end. The computation on the trader&rsquo;s desktop is a Turing machine process, even sub-Turing because it lacks an infinite memory tape. So all <em>that</em> is totally classical physics input into the economic system.))</p><p>((So where is the top-down in economics? You do not have to believe Roger Penrose to
think quantum mechanics pays a role in human thinking processes, but you should
understand human consciousness is not explained by physics (the inner subjective
phenomenal qualia). So no matter what the source of human consciousness is (we do not
really care for present purposes) whatever it is, it is not physics. So human
psychology is not driven by bottom-up blind physical events. You will need to read my
other website (<a href=https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/ target=_blank>T4G theory</a>
) to see one set of reasons
why, or just trust me. Human beings making good and bad, lame and chad, decisions are
top-down influences on economics, with bottom-up signals as other inputs.))</p><h2 id=generalized-forces><a class=anchor href=#generalized-forces title='Anchor for: Generalized Forces.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Generalized Forces</h2><p>One question one might naïvely ask is &ldquo;What are the generalized forces in an economic
system that <em>move</em> prices?&rdquo;</p><p>The six billion dollar question. Most analysts give up, and use brute raw statistical
probability theory analysis, which is admitting you have no idea about the forces.
You only know distributions of outcomes. Which I think is a fair approach, even with
state-of-the-art dynamical systems models and ANN (artificial neural networks).</p><p>The thing is, no dynamical system model can do a better prediction or modelling job
than the accuracy of your modelling assumptions permits. And no ANN can do a better
prediction or modelling job that the data it gets trained on can admit. This is
because all real ANN&rsquo;s are finite state machines. So they lack conscious thought and so
lack genuine creative insight capacity, and so cannot generate more than what
information theory à la Shannon can be found in their inputs. (This is all so
unless you subscribe to radical panpsychism.)</p><p>Anyhow, this is a big issue for our effort over at the
<a href=https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader target=_blank>DougBot project</a>
, because what I argue (with
Douglas) is that we are automating his canniness, not creating a new thinking being
that can oracle the stock prices. In pragmatic terms this does not really effect our
research, because in research a team needs push and pull. But for you philosophers of
finance this might be of interest, also if you are an investor who has come across
some wild good claims about how a genius has found a way to beat the markets and earn
you insane returns. Did someone just say &ldquo;Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo
Ponzi&rdquo;?</p><p>Rather than looking for oracle powers, the idea and method for DougBot is to use
hybrid techniques. The simplest is to use a dynamical system model, of the Steve Keen
Goodwin-Minsky variety, to get the very high level macro dynamics correct. A dude in
Portugal did this for the Portuguese economy, Pedro Sousa, you can get
<a href=https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/bitstream/10071/11199/1/TESEcorrigida.pdf target=_blank>his PhD paper here.</a>
Being in the EU this thesis was not trivial, the bank flows had to be carefully
analysed.</p><p>Such models are not going to say squat about stock prices, but they might have useful
information for informing us about macro aggregates, like the S&P500 or NASDAQ, or in
New Zealand the NPX.</p><p>The trouble is, macroeconomic models deal with fiscal flow or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoglF8_z7lk" target=_blank>Godley Tables,</a>
and there is no real generalized force in them for seeing how relative prices move,
because with the complexity available currently in these Minsky models, there is only
one price level, or two if you are clever (asset prices (I call them fictional goods)
can be partially de-coupled from goods prices, real goods being physical things
people consume, not numbers on bits of paper).</p><h3 id=forces-from-ledger-books><a class=anchor href=#forces-from-ledger-books title='Anchor for: Forces from Ledger Books?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Forces from Ledger Books?</h3><p>The Godley Tables <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoglF8_z7lk" target=_blank>illustrated here by Ty Keynes</a>
do not model generalized economic forces <em>per se</em>.
They model the accounting rules. The reason Steve Keen says his Minksy DS models
&ldquo;prove MMT&rdquo; is because he says &ldquo;MMT is just accounting.&rdquo; (This is pretty awful of
Steve, but he can be forgiven.)</p><p>We, MMT enthusiasts, would say MMT is a lot more than accounting. It is about
societies legal and financial institutional arrangements, and much more than just
accounting rules. However, in part, Steve Keen is right about the use of Godley
tables because of these legal rules. In the old days it used to be</p><h2 id=the-interest-rate-repeller><a class=anchor href=#the-interest-rate-repeller title='Anchor for: The Interest Rate repeller.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Interest Rate repeller</h2><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO: went on the rant below before finishing the notes on attractors adn repellers.

dynamics. Stock prices move by one type of set of forces, but wages by others. And
often activists are more interested in wage and consumer price goods price movements,
and could give a fig about the stock price movements.</p><p>What MMT says is these cannot all be completely de-coupled, because of the fiscal
constraints embedded in the banking system. The government has &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to set the
absolute price level (what appears in a Keen-Godowin-Minsky model) but not all the
relative prices (unless they are a totalitarian government, which we have never
really perfectly seen on Earth, just approximations).</p><p>One reason Steve Keen tarnishes his reputation by abusing the MMT community as
&ldquo;nothing but accountants&rdquo; is because it matters politically whether people understand
the MMT system, and use it wisely, and that has been the point of the MMT social
movement for over 30 years as of to date, from the founding by Warren Mosler, Bill
Mitchell and Randall Wray, coming in with Stephanie Kelton and Pavlina Tcherneva,
Matt Forstadter, Scott Fulwiler, and now legions of others.</p><p>In particular, what Steve Keen has never acknowledged correctly is the insight of
Bill Mitchell on buffer stocks, and that the MMT system which is currently an
operational reality in most nations in the world, uses a labour buffer. This is vital
to MMT understanding. Without it you get idiots like Steve Keen (I can say this,
since he is a good Internet friend, and an Aussie, so he knows I am just blowing hot
air, but only half-joking).</p><p>I also think Steve Keen is very old school on the Treasury bonds story.
Warren Mosler
<a href=http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35432615-Soft-Currency-Economics.pdf target=_blank>had the insight</a>
(no one else agreed with him at the time) that when the FED sells Treasury bonds for
&ldquo;monetary operations&rdquo; it was functionally the same as Treasury selling bonds for
&ldquo;fiscal operations&rdquo;. He realized you cannot call them different functions. Still to
this day most post-Keynesians disagree, and this is not a mere accounting squabble.
People agree about the software operations, I think. It is a government function
insight. The FED cannot be thought of as a private entity independent of US
government. If you still think otherwise, you are not MMT aware.</p><p>The thing is, it makes a huge difference in political economy, so is far, <em>far</em>
beyond the impact of &ldquo;just accounting.&rdquo; It can ruin people&rsquo;s lives, and always those
who lives are already the most miserable, but pushing an austerity politics using the
interest rate repeller, among other injustices.</p><p>I would also claim that warren Mosler best understood the impact of moving to a
floating exchange rte, and the fiscal space this freed up for a government.
Post-Keynesians (generally, not all) still do not comprehend this, and Steve Keen
seems to still be one of them. Most post-Keynesian think the exchange rate is an
exogenous constraint. MMT says it is not, not if you understand the correct actual
software-driven, legally instituted monetary operations available to governments. But
this includes *legal. Let me say it gains <strong>-legal arrangements.</strong> MMT says these
matter, over and above the accounting principles. This is vital for understanding why
no fit currency issuing government has any foreign exchange constraint (they do if
the make up one). Only Mosler in 1995 understood this. Nd most post-Keynesian still
do not, hence we have stupid debates about trade policy and exports as a cost,
imports as a benefit (the MMT story, which is correct). The exports are the price you
pay for your imports. This is not &ldquo;neoclassical&rdquo; thinking as Steve Keen slurs the MMT
community with, it is just logic.</p><p>But the logic can cause suffering for poorer nations if people do not understand it. Like the logic of what happens when you ignore momentum and walk into street lamp poles.</p><p>Once Steve acknowledges all this, and the other generalized forces on the MMT social
movement, he will apologise to us! He is a good guy. I mean a <em>really</em> good and nice
guy. Salt of the Earth, with a bit of a fire cracker in his hand too though. Also, I
am pretty sure he is trolling us when he says &ldquo;MMT is just accounting.&rdquo; So I took the
bait. Also, he said that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoMPlG5kgNE" target=_blank>at an MMT Conference</a>
,
so of course he was having an Aussie lark, but he can also be damaging to the MMT
movement when he says such things more publicly, because they are wrong. This matters because Steve is a very influential economist and activist.</p><p>((<strong>Note to self:</strong> need to write a theory section on trade. When we write about trade, the important thing is to not be too simplistic and naïve (a word I seem to need to use a lot). Fadhel Kaboub and Jan Kregel are MMT aware and have a decent body of work on international trade, and the exchange rate is not their problem, the biggest problems by far are imperial power abuses, neocolonialism, and just broadly war and injustice and dysfunctional justice systems in the weaker nations. Fixing up their exchange rate is pretty much negligible help with all that, but they need the MMT lens to know what to do about it when they restore civil society. Australia will never have a foreign exchange constraint because their government know how to tell foreign buyers of their land and politicians to piss off &mdash; at least if they want too, if they do not want to, well,&mldr; then they&rsquo;re less civilized.))</p><p>Even <em>more generally</em> we are, in the DougBot project, using an MMT understanding, a
lens, to do finer grain price analysis. It is not merely accounting, and although we
could call it post-Keynesian, or Institutionalist, MMT is a superset of these
schools, not a subset. Anyone thinking otherwise is just being very nasty to the
founders of the movement like Mosler and Mitchell. Randall Wray is a better arbiter,
since he was a post-Keynesian, and still is! He considers himself now MMT in thought.
Not that any of these labels and names matter, but funnily in the economics
profession they seem to, like they do not in physics or mathematics where I come
from.</p><p><a href=./>Next post (TBD)</a><br><a href=../6_cashless>Previous post (Is a Cashless Society Good?)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Blog TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
