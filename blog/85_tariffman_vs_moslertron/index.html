‚Äúcelebrity chef‚Äù figure who was touting himself as enthusiastic about
the Trump tariffs. For the life of me I could not tell if it was deeply
sarcastic or plain stupid, nor whether Green was also stupid or just
so Œ£ for getting the sarcasm.</p><p>I hazarded a guess at &ldquo;plain stupid&rdquo;. So posted this comment as an
antidote:</p><blockquote><p>One ought not be excited by tariffs from any angle? (I would say yeeaah.)
It is all madness. But if a government knows their monetary system and their
full available policy space they can always afford to give Trumpistas their
metaphorical middle finger. The tragedy of these tariff-wars is that
governments do not understand, so will likely hurt themselves (or their
people), unaided by Mr Trump. It is all about the policy response, not what
the other guy does in such matters. US manufacturers want to sell you more
of their stuff? You can buy. They do not want your stuff? You get to keep
it (or sell to someone else). All the better for the someone else.<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Just like the sanctions placed on
Russia back-fired, the USA ‚Äúleadership‚Äù have this backward too, yet so do
the governments Trump is targeting. They aught to realize they can win big
from Trump&rsquo;s insane trade policies.</p></blockquote><p>Note: I am not an active academic researcher in this area nor econ journo
who thinks about tariffs all day long. But you do not need to in order to
appreciate the mainstream economists have things backwards as usual, and so
the government policy responses on both sides will likely be all screwed
up too, since for some godforsaken unknown reason politicians and policy
wonks still seem to think credentialed economists have useful things to
say which a 12 year old does not intuitively comprehend.</p><p>In trying to hurt Trump country you will end up hurting your home country.</p><p>Retaliation is for war and Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, not for Trade.</p><hr><p>OK, that was the Moslertron version.</p><h2 id=the-long-winded-version><a class=anchor href=#the-long-winded-version title='Anchor for: The Long Winded Version.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Long Winded Version</h2><p>Here‚Äôs a sober MMT breakdown of some of the arguments around
and implications of tariffs.</p><h3 id=government-revenue-and-sovereignty><a class=anchor href=#government-revenue-and-sovereignty title='Anchor for: Government Revenue and Sovereignty.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Government Revenue and Sovereignty</h3><p>MMT posits that a currency-sovereign government, like the USA, which issues
its own fiat currency (USD), does not need to generate revenue through taxes
or tariffs to fund spending. Instead, it can create money as needed,
constrained only by inflation risks.</p><p>From this perspective, the argument that tariffs &ldquo;raise revenue&rdquo; for the
U.S. government is economically irrelevant under MMT because the government
does not require external funding to operate. Instead, tariffs act as a
policy tool with other effects, such as
<a href=https://journalistsresource.org/economics/trump-tariffs-webinar/ target=_blank>influencing trade flows or domestic production</a>
.</p><h3 id=impact-on-importers-and-consumers><a class=anchor href=#impact-on-importers-and-consumers title='Anchor for: Impact on Importers and Consumers.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Impact on Importers and Consumers</h3><p>Tariffs are effectively taxes on imports, which are paid by U.S. businesses
importing goods, not foreign exporters. This raises costs for U.S. importers,
who often pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This
can lead to inflationary pressures and
<a href=https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs target=_blank>reduced purchasing power for households</a>
.</p><p>Foreign exporters may respond by raising prices or diverting sales to
other markets,
<a href=https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/ target=_blank>minimizing their own economic harm</a>
.
Thus, the burden of tariffs could disproportionately fall on U.S.
entities. How disproportionate? Entirely depends on the other country‚Äôs
government policy response level of MMT awareness. But you know‚Ä¶ it could
just end up in misery all around.</p><p>HHow can I write that? Because the whole idea is to ‚Äúincrease government savings‚Äù! An inapplicable notion when your government is the issuer of the currency. It amounts to demand withdrawal elsewhere. The key question is where is that else? Again, that‚Äôll be a foreing governemtn policy response determination.</p><p>Some economics think Canada and Mexico will feel most of the burden,
but this is false. An MMT perspective would say that&rsquo;d be true only if the
Mexican and Canadian government &ldquo;retaliate&rdquo; instead of using the more
appropriate MMT recommended fiscal adjustments. If a foreign entity marks
prices upwards, the domestic currency can always be re-gauged. This is not
inflation. It is a one-time adjustment in domestic prices that hurts
no one. The wage has to go up too, all prices. One-time adjustment.
In fact, it is a good excuse for a wise government to boost low-end wages
more. Pushing all prices upwards but from the base.</p><p>(If a general price re-gauging is desired, this is <em>always</em> the better way
to implement the gauging. Just you try stopping the trickle-up! You&rsquo;d need
to euthanize the rentiers &mdash; which is a much longer term project.)</p><p>There are other policy responses too, such as seeking other buyers for
your exports, and the governments of Mexico and Canada can use some light
subsidies to help the firms dependent on exporting if they so choose. (This
can also help the one-time price adjustment in a well-targeted fashion.)
But the real terms of trade are what are more important, the imports! Thus
retaliation against the USA by making U.S. imports more expensive for your
own economy is the stupid policy response.</p><p>Unfortunately this does not mean Canada and Mexico will not go down the
stupid path.</p><p>Remember: <strong>it is not about jobs!</strong></p><p>Tariffs are never about jobs. If the Tariffman (resp. Tariffwoman) wanted
more jobs created in the USA (resp. Mexico), they could employ idle
workers. Almost in any industry, probably even with some executive orders,
if not, Congressional approval only is needed. The Treasury and FED (resp.
Central Bank) take marching orders from Congress (resp. Parliament).</p><p>They could even construct houses and whole ghost cities for no one to
live in. The sophisticated Chinese version of Keynes&rsquo; &ldquo;digging ditches and
fill them in again&rdquo;. They at least had something to show for the
construction company grift.</p><p>The central government can always employ anyone not employed by the
private sector, without incurring inflationary pressures. This is simply a
<em>policy choice</em>. After first expanding public services if desired, the
policy choice is then whether to run an unemployed labour buffer or a fully
employed labour buffer.</p><h3 id=trade-deficits-and-real-goods><a class=anchor href=#trade-deficits-and-real-goods title='Anchor for: Trade Deficits and Real Goods.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Trade Deficits and Real Goods</h3><p>MMT views imports as a net benefit because they provide real goods and
services in exchange for financial claims (currency) that the U.S., as a
sovereign issuer of dollars, can <a href=https://www.moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf target=_blank>create at will</a>
. Conversely, exports
are seen as a cost because they involve sending real resources abroad.</p><p>Imposing tariffs reduces imports, which MMT proponents argue harms the U.S.
by limiting access to these real goods while doing little to benefit
exporters who can
<a href="https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61890" target=_blank>find alternative markets</a>
.
This aligns with the critique that tariffs hurt the U.S. economy more
than they help.</p><h3 id=economic-costs-of-tariffs><a class=anchor href=#economic-costs-of-tariffs title='Anchor for: Economic Costs of Tariffs.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Economic Costs of Tariffs</h3><p>Most <a href=https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-tariffs-potential-implications target=_blank>empirical analyses</a>
shows that tariffs reduce GDP growth, employment, and
investment in the long run. For example:</p><ul><li>The proposed Trump-era tariffs
<a href=https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/ target=_blank>could shrink U.S. GDP</a>
by up to 1.3% and
cost over a million full-time jobs if fully implemented.</li><li>Tariffs also lead to dollar appreciation, making U.S. exports less
competitive globally and further harming domestic producers reliant on international markets
(see <a href=https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs target=_blank>‚ÄúA global economist‚Äôs take on tariffs‚Äù</a>
).</li><li>Without complementary industrial policies to boost domestic production,
tariffs alone fail to achieve meaningful economic benefits while imposing
significant costs on consumers and businesses <em><a href=https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs target=_blank>Ibid.</a>
</em>.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion><a class=anchor href=#conclusion title='Anchor for: Conclusion.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Recognize most of the Tumpo doctrines are just designed to cause havoc.
No <em>other</em> rhyme nor reason is needed for them. But you have ways to avoid
the havoc if you have the pleasure of living somewhere else and have
government powers.</p><p>From an MMT perspective, tariffs are counterproductive for a
currency-sovereign nation like the U.S., as they harm domestic consumers
and businesses while reducing access to beneficial imports. Empirical
data supports this view, showing that tariffs depress economic growth
and employment without significantly benefiting domestic industries unless
paired with broader industrial strategies.</p><p>The appropriate policy response of a government feeling it‚Äôs exporters
are going to be hurt by the tariffs imposed by Tariffman is to;<br><strong>(a)</strong> recognize your exporters have no place at any trade negotiation
table on your end, their interest is in the wealth of the foreign buyers,
and the suppression of your domestic workers. (b) You can always ensure
full non-ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° employment and have a great standard of living.
<strong>(c)</strong> There is always a buyer for your stuff. Judicious fiscal adjustment
can avoid all the pain, can avoid 100% of the pain.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../84_the_neos_and_their_one>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../86_nexus_of_neuronheads>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../84_the_neos_and_their_one>The Neo's And Their One</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../86_nexus_of_neuronheads>Nexus Of Neuronheads</a></td></tr></table></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
