Michael Hudson and Steve Keen ranting on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q8wgMQjDFI" target=_blank>DemystifySci podcast (here)</a>
.
A nice confluence of an offbeat youtube
channels I occassionally watch and MMM (the framework formerly known as MMT ;-)</p><p>I posted comment sthere, but pretty sure they&rsquo;ll get &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; (deleted)
by someone. However, DemystifySci often have some interesting content
on Ai, biotech, and related. It&rsquo;s not all loony tunes, even though sometimes
it is. Science as entertainment for nerds.</p><p>As usual Hudson rants a lot, making extreme exaggerated statements. But I
have no terrible beef with him, he is in a sense simply countering the
mainstream economics rhetoric and so helping reject all the neoliberal garbage.</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title='Anchor for: Caveats.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>I wrote the comments on the DemystifySci channel in a rush, and a bit
hot headed. Feel free to
<a href=/ohanga-pai/contact/>contact me</a>
to let me know if you think I have
something terribly wrong.</p><h2 id=rents-are-not-necessary><a class=anchor href=#rents-are-not-necessary title='Anchor for: Rents are Not Necessary.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Rents are Not Necessary</h2><p>What started me commenting was when the host guy tried to correct Keen by
claming some rent is necessary.</p><p>The overarching point is that no one should ever need to be forced to pay rent
on the necessities (food, clothing, shelter, electricity, healthcare). These
are public services, or should be, so un-privatise them! If your nation wants
people to be free to charge rent between themselves for non-essentials,
well&mldr; try it out. But for heavens sake, protect the innocent from fraudsters
and banksters. Regulate the banks, à la
<a href=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking_b_432105 target=_blank>Mosler’s proposals</a>
.</p><p>My comment:</p><blockquote><p>@58:00 host dude badly wrong here. We do <em><em>not</em></em> need rents. At least not
for young couples seeking a first home. Housing (and education and healthcare)
should not be a commodity (see Polanyi). Governments can always fund the
first home buyers, and have some of the housing cost repaid as a fair
proportion of the family income as a tax (not a pay-for) if house construction
is slow. None of this is &ldquo;tax payer funded&rdquo; because governments issue the
currency by fiat, it is mere scorekeeping for the government. They impose taxes
to create demand for the currency, not supply. The government is the supplier.
Interview Warren Mosler on all this.<br>      Also, commercial banks are in all cases
chartered by the state, they are for all effects simply agents of the state.
They should be tamed as such, because they&rsquo;re dangerous beats. A bank should
be regarded as a public utility for running the payments system, nothing more,
except perhaps assessing credit risk. But the credit is again scorekeeping:
the currency does not come form anywhere, banks just type a number into your
bank account and an equal number on their books as an asset which records the
loan (promise to repay). Banks have no business doing any other financial
activity. This is Mosler&rsquo;s narrow banking proposals. Keep the banks tamed
and operating in the public interest, not for-profit. The bankers could be
simply salaried contractors (if you want to avoid excessive politicization)
or community trusts.<br>      Note: governments never need a &ldquo;pay for&rdquo;.
They issue the currency by accounting entries. They need instead demand for
the currency, which is the purpose of imposing taxes fees and fines, not to
&ldquo;pay for&rdquo; anything in monetary terms. It&rsquo;s all about real terms (for a fiat
currency issuer), real resources, not &ldquo;the money&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about &ldquo;the money&rdquo;
only if you have an IOU that no one wants, so you need to earn someone else&rsquo;s
IOU. State currencies are IOUs of the government, they make people need it
by imposing taxes (primarily, unless they are oil rich in which case oil
buyers take their currency). I&rsquo;l repeat: talk to Warren Mosler.</p></blockquote><h3 id=some-elaborations-on-rentiers><a class=anchor href=#some-elaborations-on-rentiers title='Anchor for: Some Elaborations on Rentiers.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Some Elaborations on Rentiers</h3><p>If an older couple own a house they&rsquo;re not living in then it should be taxed
away from them if it is not occupied. If they seek to rent it, government
regulations should automatically kick in to purchase it off them, at fair
market value. There is no &ldquo;tax payer&rdquo; or &ldquo;bank borrowing&rdquo; funding this, the
government just credits the old folks bank account using a computer. Frees up
the house for that young couple. Older couple have currency they could then
invest in real production, you might hope. No rentiers. Euthanize them.</p><h3 id=some-elaboration-on-debt-jubilee><a class=anchor href=#some-elaboration-on-debt-jubilee title='Anchor for: Some Elaboration on Debt Jubilee.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Some Elaboration on Debt Jubilee</h3><p>Hudson went on a rant claiming the USA cannot cancel debts. He&rsquo;s only half
right. It is about willingness to pay, not capacity to pay.</p><blockquote><p>@1:12:00 c&rsquo;mon! Governments have <em><em>always</em></em> had the power to cancel debts.
State currency is simply scorekeeping (with severe legal and economic
consequences for fraud etc.). Your problem is who controls government &mdash;
it&rsquo;s the proverbial One Percent. Michael is being disingenuous about the USA.
All USD issuing private banks are chartered by the state, they cannot exist
without the US State. The issue is who regulates them? The answer is the
oligarchs, the One Percent, the bankers get to regulate themselves (as Obama
allowed). Point is, Obama (c.2008) and Congress should not have allowed them
to regulate themselves! Nor should any government. Proper role of government
is to fulfill the public purpose, not private profit. But it&rsquo;ll be private
profit government until the citizenry seize back control of what aught to
be <em>their (the citizenry)</em> government apparatus.</p></blockquote><p>I added a bit more&mldr;</p><p>What I mean is, it&rsquo;s not just China that has the power to cancel private
debts for poorer households. All governments can, except the eurozone, who
are no longer sovereign governments, they&rsquo;d rely on the unelected ECB to
cancel debts. But even there, the ECB could vote to cancel private debts
for poorer eurozone households. It has to be (read: shoudl be) done fairly,
by a little bit of simple accounting. Households that were defrauded, that
is, forced to borrow (use their credit cards) from banks to pay for
electricity, groceries, etc., should get their debt cancelled.
Not households that took bank credit to buy yachts and condominiums.</p><p>Or, a one-time debt jubilee could occur via Prof Keen&rsquo;s idea, to give the
same lump sum to all households, but those with debt have to pay off their
debt (so it is automatic) and those without debt have to invest in real
<strong><em>sustainable</em></strong> production (according to a sustainable firm schedule,
also automatic, they get the shares only, not cash). However, this does
further (needlessly) enrich the One Percent, so I&rsquo;d apply a simple debt
jubilee cap if I were supreme benevolent dictator ;-).</p><p>But this <em>also</em> in conjunction with Warren Mosler&rsquo;s proposal for eliminating
the gambling casino that <em>is</em> the stock market. I&rsquo;d limit all share prices
to $\$$10 max.
Opening at say $\$$10. Once the price hits
$\$$10/share the firm can sell more shares. Fix price, let quantity float.
Same as a fiat currency operation should be. The idea is to maximize
employment &mdash; in this case &ldquo;employment&rdquo; in real sustainable goods
production of available investor equity. Not to make profits for rentiers.</p><p>Hudson should not be ranting by claiming the US State cannot cancel debts.
He&rsquo;s only half right. It is about willingness to pay, not capacity to pay.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:25%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../42_israel_palestine>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./44_sat_redo>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../42_israel_palestine>Israel Palestine</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../44_sat_redo>SAT Redo</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
