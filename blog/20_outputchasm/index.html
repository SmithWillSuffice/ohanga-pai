the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvPLZsgEcXSbdqMUTc-4usIO-9f0xBlc" target=_blank>MMT Fiscal Sustainability Conference 2010</a>
, but that also led me to
<a href="https://youtu.be/hTWEFKH144M?t=1827" target=_blank>Bill Mitchell's incredibly powerful statements</a>
on the massive costs of unemployment. The latter is what I want to focus more on
today. I think it&rsquo;s the single most important topic in macroeconomics. And second
only in <em>political</em> economy to the issue of lasting world peace.</p><h2 id=the-output-gap><a class=anchor href=#the-output-gap title='Anchor for: The Output Gap.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Output Gap</h2><p>The output gap is defined as the difference between real GDP produced in a given year
and the potential maximum GDP that <em>could</em> have been produced had all available
resources been fully employed.</p><p>Notice a problem with that definition?</p><p>It implies slavery of some description. So we&rsquo;d better fix it. We do not really want
to estimate the &ldquo;maximum potential GDP&rdquo; but rather the <em>optimal</em> level of GDP from
full resource employment. Now what does that mean? Well, there are at least two
problems with maximisation as compared to optimization (maybe more than two):</p><ol><li>We do not want nominal GDP to be the measure, it has to be real GDP, and that also
means we should want to count only non-bullsh*t jobs.</li><li>Human well-being should <em>also</em> be optimized, which is not factored in any way in the
NIPA accounting, so we cannot just maximise output, since that will entail some sort of
wage slavery at the very least. We do not want optimal GDP to include any wage slavery
(coercive or brutal work conditions).</li></ol><p>On point 1: if useless products are sold, and that gets counted as real GDP, we&rsquo;re
not doing the NIPA accounts justice. We do want to count all the sh*t jobs. Those are
necessary jobs someone has to do, which are generally considered unpleasant.</p><p>Bullsh*t jobs (as <a href=https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant/ target=_blank>identified by David Graeber</a>
)
may or may not be pleasant work
conditions, but are typically associated with spiritual violence (&ldquo;I hate my job&rdquo;) and
are jobs understood, usually by the worker, to be unnecessary for a decent human
civilization.</p><p>On point 2: because human well-being is subjective, it is hard to quantify optimal potential GDP. We really should use some other metrics. But failing that, we can
&ldquo;do a Keynes&rdquo; and for now take the recent past as the best guide to the present.
Although that&rsquo;s going to be conservative and regressive, it could also be considered
a fair baseline, because the greater the well-being of workers usually the more productive and less bullsh*t the work. So a reactionary conservative posture (the recent past) will likely under-estimate the output gap.</p><p>That is ok for our purposes, because all we need to show is that the estimated
conservative output gap is still an horrific waste of human lives, a veritable crime against humanity (or should be thought of as so).</p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO: this is an article stub.

productive firms) from the more finance rentier types (people speculating in purely
financial assets and derivatives &mdash; as Mosler puts it, a total waste of human
endeavour.)</p><p>Real investors are people with marginal savings: money they do not need, so seek to
&ldquo;put it to work&rdquo; for some return on their investment.</p><p>Did not Keynes say that the drain on an economy were the rentiers and the savers &mdash;
people <em>not</em> spending all their income. So true.</p><p>If everyone spent all their income it would drive up supply, i.e., output, and lead
us close to full employment, if not full non-bullsh<em>t job employment. I realize
&ldquo;non-bullsh</em>t&rdquo; is doing a lot of work here, it basically is a way of capturing the microeconomics but speaking at a macro level, so a bit dodgy.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tragedy of our times is firms do not like to hire the long term
unemployed, and yet deliberate neoliberal policy generates long term unemployment, by
design, due to their NAIRU myth. So we have a problem, even if everyone tried to
spend all their income, it is unlikely firms will hire all workers. So we&rsquo;d still
have a small output gap.</p><p>However, the point to make today is that we are nowhere near full employment, and
have not been near full employment in any major industrialized country since the
1960&rsquo;s, when neoliberalism roughly started to take hold, the monetarists become
grossly ascendant, and austerity and &ldquo;belt-tightening&rdquo; became the foolish order of
the day, which the innocent public swallowed like bitter medicine (which is how PR
firms fraudulently sold neoliberalism), or like lambs to the slaughter.</p><p>Worse than that, if you just look at the employment numbers you are failing to count
all the truly bullsh*t jobs. Those are <em>also</em> massive opportunity costs, severe costs.</p><h3 id=the-social-costs-of-unemployment><a class=anchor href=#the-social-costs-of-unemployment title='Anchor for: The Social Costs of Unemployment.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Social Costs of Unemployment</h3><p>The better MMT&rsquo;ers list these, and here I will steal a few from Wray and Tcherneva.</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-TODO: data-lang=TODO:>dependency ratios, rising crime, suicide, ...
