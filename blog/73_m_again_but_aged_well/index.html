(Intellectual
wine for me, I don&rsquo;t drink intoxicants except coffee. Healthy body, healthy
mind, and all that.)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGoT_A5fqc" target=_blank>Mosler at the Berkely Forum c.2022.</a></p><p>This aged Mosler goes down well, but the youtube comments section is
something I hardly ever get to read, since I&rsquo;m typically too early to see
critics, or far too late to be bothered. But for this one I had a few
comments to make.</p><h2 id=myth-of-barter><a class=anchor href=#myth-of-barter title='Anchor for: Myth of Barter.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Myth of Barter</h2><p>Good ol&rsquo; &ldquo;Rob&rdquo; inserts his usual simplistic critique of MMT. He points out in
pre-colonial Africa Mosler is saying there was a non-monetary economy, until
the British came in to force the natives to grow coffee by imposing coercive
tax liabilities &mdash; the infamous and downright cruel Hut Tax.</p><p>Rob claims Mosler is being contradictory with Randall Wray, since Wray
insists there were never pure barter economies. The thing is, both Mosler
and Wray are correct. It is far too simplistic to say barter equals
&ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a logical subset fallacy: the &ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo; is a far
larger category than &ldquo;barter&rdquo; &mdash; when we define &ldquo;money&rdquo; in very specific
terms, to with <strong>_state tax credits</strong>.</p><p>With a broader definition of &ldquo;money&rdquo; then a barter economy can be seen to be
a monetary economy. Just not using a tax credit. But to the extent such a
small economy is using a type of account record, it is not pure barter.
In pure barter you cannot put anything &ldquo;on credit&rdquo;. Where can you find such economies? They are rare, and tend to be village level in size, everyone
knows everyone else, meaning little need for account records.</p><p>My counter:</p><blockquote><p>Note that &ldquo;barter&rdquo; vs &ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo; are two different things, there is
overlap, but not perfect coincidence. No large scale economies have ever
been barter, it is too inefficient and people know it instinctively, there
are thus always accounting records (records of who owes whom what) and
technically that <em>is</em> a monetary system, but not in the sense Mosler talks
about. Mosler is talking specifically about a fiat currency driven by
coercive tax liabilities, not just accounting records. But in a simple
economy with a large number of people who cannot afford to trust each other
blindly, there will be accounting records, and that <em>is</em> &ldquo;the money&rdquo;. Never
pure barter. A few households can run pure barter, but not more than a few
thousand.</p></blockquote><h2 id=governments-_are_-implementing-mmt><a class=anchor href=#governments-_are_-implementing-mmt title='Anchor for: Governments are &ldquo;implementing MMT&rdquo;??.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Governments <em>are</em> &ldquo;implementing MMT&rdquo;??</h2><p>This is a giant &ldquo;WTF!&rdquo; One youtube poster was essentially blaming &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; for
all the ills of today&rsquo;s inflations, etc., the usual straw-man attack on MMT.</p><p>My counter:</p><blockquote><p>No government is implementing MMT recommended policy (ZIRP, JG, eliminate
payroll tax and VAT/GST), but <em>all governments</em> outside the EMU have an MMT
operations system. You cannot legitimately criticize MMT for politicians who
do not understand their own currency system, MMT activists have been
struggling for decades trying to get politicians to understand, and they
either do and refuse to admit it, or choose to be ignorant for their own
political purposes. As Phil Waller, and a few others, remarked: where is
the country implementing a Job Guarantee? Not even &ldquo;MMT Japan&rdquo; is
implementing.</p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that tax return is often considered
deflationary, but demand withdrawal, but that&rsquo;s a slight myth. Tax liabilities
drive the demand, tax returns withdraw demand, but do not immediately alter
prices. Firm have to actively reduce prices to clear sales, but they tend not
too, especially these days with credit cards all around. It might be a whole
different story of not for credit cards and overdraughts, in fact
it <em>would be</em> totally different. But as things stand today, tax return does
not actively lower the price level, it can prevent the prices from going up
too fast. Tax drains certainly tend to suppress the stock market for a week
or so &mdash; hardly a catastrophe for the real economy.</p><p>The <em>more</em> interesting thing is the vast free-up in real terms when payroll
and GST taxes are eliminated. Mosler estimates it would free up around 10% of
GDP, maybe more. Governments seem to have no clue about this,
and probably do not know the massive amount of wasted human lives spent on
needless tax compliance. Eliminating GST and payroll taxes would likely be
inflation neutral in the mid-term, since although increasing effective
demand, it frees up a huge amount of human labour hours to do better things.
What is demanded when GST and payroll taxes are dropped to 0% rate would be
an offset fiscal policy to employ the newly unemployed.</p><p>We could call that a Job Guarantee, but really there is no good reason to
use the JG this way, it is an abuse. The proper thing to do would be to
employ all those unemployed tax lawyers and accountants for the public
purpose in skilled work &mdash; if they want it &mdash; say in investigating
financial fraud, or helping out at the local school or orphanage &mdash; teaching
MMT of course! ;-)</p><blockquote><p>Mitchell: <em>&ldquo;We wake up every day to severe labour shortages.</em>&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=inflation-fear-mongering><a class=anchor href=#inflation-fear-mongering title='Anchor for: Inflation Fear-mongering.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Inflation Fear-mongering</h2><p>The usual critics appear blaming MMT for inflation. At this point in history
I am almost prepared to ignore them, they&rsquo;ve become total idiots. A few years
ago maybe they were excusable, since MMT was largely unknown, but there is
no excuse today, you can get models that are mainstream/IS_LM/DSGE and models
that are more MMT-like, and compare. The mainstream models are just plain
wrong, on the empirical evidence. Douglas and the boys over at AppliedMMT
are trading in almost a naïve way, which should not work at all, but they
make winning trades, because they&rsquo;re using the MMT lens.</p><p>The main comment to make on inflation (defined as the
term structure of prices faced by consumers today):</p><blockquote><p>Nominal inflation is never an economic problem, it is a psychological
problem (gets you voted out of office sometimes). Real inflation is the
killer for the low income households. (But that is not new in MMT, it&rsquo;s
just obvious.)</p></blockquote><p>Note that when we talk about the <em>term structure of prices</em> then that is a
rate of change measure, the time period is the denominator. Or at least that
is implicit. Look at a table of the term structure, divide the price
differences by the time interval, and you roughly get an inflation forecast.</p><p>You cannot look backwards and say the reported CPI or PCE (personal
consumption expenditures). Even
<a href=https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci3-6.html target=_blank>this article here</a>
kinda&rsquo; gets it wrong, you
can take CPI as a good measure, for past changes in the price level. What
does CPI tell you about the <strong><em>current</em></strong> rate of inflation though? Next to
nothing. Why?</p><p>It is because active government policy is needed to sustain inflation.
Inflation is not a natural phenomenon. If anything deflation is slightly more
natural due to more or less continual productivity gains due to improved
technology. Off-setting this is rampant consumerism and greed, of course.
Another bias for pro-inflation is demands of the lower paid for better
equity, and when that is the inflation driver then it is a good thing, not
to be complained about.</p><p>I guess you can say human greed is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t. We are not greedy
inherently. Tonnes of artificial incentives and artificial scarcity make us
greedy, primarily the excessive tax burden, which MMMT claims is overkill.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../71_milieu_of_milei>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../71_milieu_of_milei>Milieu of Milei</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
