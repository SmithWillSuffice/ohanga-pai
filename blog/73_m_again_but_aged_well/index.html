appearances age well. (Intellectual wine for me, I don&rsquo;t drink intoxicants
except coffee. Healthy body, healthy mind, and all that.)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGoT_A5fqc" target=_blank>Mosler at the Berkely Forum c.2022.</a></p><p>This aged Mosler goes down well, but the youtube comments section is
something I hardly ever get to read, since I&rsquo;m typically too early to see
critics, or far too late to be bothered. But for this one I had a few
comments to make.</p><h2 id=myth-of-barter><a class=anchor href=#myth-of-barter title='Anchor for: Myth of Barter.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Myth of Barter</h2><p>Good ol&rsquo; &ldquo;Rob&rdquo; inserts his usual simplistic critique of MMT. He points out,
for the case of pre-colonial Africa, Mosler is saying there was a non-monetary
economy, until the British came in to force the natives to grow coffee by
imposing coercive tax liabilities &mdash; the infamous and downright cruel Hut Tax.</p><p>Rob claims Mosler is being contradictory with Randall Wray, since Wray
insists there were never pure barter economies. The thing is, both Mosler
and Wray are correct. It is far too simplistic to say barter equals
&ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a logical subset fallacy: the &ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo; is a far
larger category than &ldquo;barter&rdquo; &mdash; when we define &ldquo;money&rdquo; in very specific
terms, to with <strong><em>state tax credits</em></strong>.</p><p>With a broader definition of &ldquo;money&rdquo; then a barter economy can be seen to be
a monetary economy. Just not using a tax credit. But to the extent such a
small economy is using a type of account record, it is not pure barter.
In pure barter you cannot put anything &ldquo;on credit&rdquo;. Where can you find such
economies? They are rare, and tend to be village level in size, everyone
knows everyone else, meaning little need for account records.</p><p>My counter:</p><blockquote><p>Note that &ldquo;barter&rdquo; vs &ldquo;non-monetary&rdquo; are two different things, there is
overlap, but not perfect coincidence. No large scale economies have ever
been barter, it is too inefficient and people know it instinctively, there
are thus always accounting records (records of who owes whom what) and
technically that <em>is</em> a monetary system, but not in the sense Mosler talks
about. Mosler is talking specifically about a fiat currency driven by
coercive tax liabilities, not just accounting records. But in a simple
economy with a large number of people who cannot afford to trust each other
blindly, there will be accounting records, and that <em>is</em> &ldquo;the money&rdquo;. Never
pure barter. A few households can run pure barter, but not more than a few
thousand.</p></blockquote><h2 id=governments-are-implementing-mmt><a class=anchor href=#governments-are-implementing-mmt title='Anchor for: Governments are &ldquo;implementing MMT&rdquo;??.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Governments are &ldquo;implementing MMT&rdquo;??</h2><p>This is a giant &ldquo;WTF!&rdquo; One youtube poster was essentially blaming &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; for
all the ills of today&rsquo;s inflations, etc., the usual straw-man attack on MMT.</p><p>My counter:</p><blockquote><p>No government is implementing MMT recommended policy (ZIRP, JG, eliminate
payroll tax and VAT/GST), but <em>all governments</em> outside the EMU have an MMT
operations system. You cannot legitimately criticize MMT for politicians who
do not understand their own currency system, MMT activists have been
struggling for decades trying to get politicians to understand, and they
either do and refuse to admit it, or choose to be ignorant for their own
political purposes. As Phil Waller, and a few others, remarked: where is
the country implementing a Job Guarantee? Not even &ldquo;MMT Japan&rdquo; is
implementing.</p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing here is that tax return is often considered
deflationary, but demand withdrawal, but that&rsquo;s a slight myth. Tax liabilities
drive the demand, tax returns withdraw demand, but do not immediately alter
prices. Firm have to actively reduce prices to clear sales, but they tend not
too, especially these days with credit cards all around. It might be a whole
different story of not for credit cards and overdraughts, in fact
it <em>would be</em> totally different. But as things stand today, tax return does
not actively lower the price level, it can prevent the prices from going up
too fast. Tax drains certainly tend to suppress the stock market for a week
or so &mdash; hardly a catastrophe for the real economy.</p><p>The <em>more</em> interesting thing is the vast free-up in real terms when payroll
and GST taxes are eliminated. Mosler estimates it would free up around 10% of
GDP, maybe more. Governments seem to have no clue about this,
and probably do not know the massive amount of wasted human lives spent on
needless tax compliance. Eliminating GST and payroll taxes would likely be
inflation neutral in the mid-term, since although increasing effective
demand, it frees up a huge amount of human labour hours to do better things.
What is demanded when GST and payroll taxes are dropped to 0% rate would be
an offset fiscal policy to employ the newly unemployed.</p><p>We could call that a Job Guarantee, but really there is no good reason to
use the JG this way, it is an abuse. The proper thing to do would be to
employ all those unemployed tax lawyers and accountants for the public
purpose in skilled work &mdash; if they want it &mdash; say in investigating
financial fraud, or helping out at the local school or orphanage &mdash; teaching
MMT of course! ;-)</p><blockquote><p>Mitchell: <em>&ldquo;We wake up every day to severe labour shortages.</em>&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=inflation-fear-mongering><a class=anchor href=#inflation-fear-mongering title='Anchor for: Inflation Fear-mongering.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Inflation Fear-mongering</h2><p>The usual critics appear blaming MMT for inflation. At this point in history
I am almost prepared to ignore them, they&rsquo;ve become total idiots. A few years
ago maybe they were excusable, since MMT was largely unknown, but there is
no excuse today, you can get models that are mainstream/IS_LM/DSGE and models
that are more MMT-like, and compare. The mainstream models are just plain
wrong, on the empirical evidence. Douglas and the boys over at AppliedMMT
are trading in almost a naïve way, which should not work at all, but they
make winning trades, because they&rsquo;re using the MMT lens.</p><p>The main comment to make on inflation (defined as the
term structure of prices faced by consumers today):</p><blockquote><p>Nominal inflation is never an economic problem, it is a psychological
problem (gets you voted out of office sometimes). Real inflation is the
killer for the low income households. (But that is not new in MMT, it&rsquo;s
just obvious.)</p></blockquote><p>Note that when we talk about the <em>term structure of prices</em> then that is a
rate of change measure, the time period is the denominator. Or at least that
is implicit. Look at a table of the term structure, divide the price
differences by the time interval, and you roughly get an inflation forecast.</p><p>You cannot look backwards and say the reported CPI or PCE (personal
consumption expenditures). Even
<a href=https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci3-6.html target=_blank>this article here</a>
kinda&rsquo; gets it wrong, you
can take CPI as a good measure, for <em>past changes in the price level</em>. What
does CPI tell you about the <strong><em>current</em></strong> rate of inflation though? Next to
nothing. Why?</p><p>It is because active government policy is needed to sustain inflation.
Inflation is not a natural phenomenon. If anything deflation is slightly more
natural due to more or less continual productivity gains due to improved
technology. Off-setting this is rampant consumerism and greed, of course.
Another bias for pro-inflation is demand from the lower paid for better
equity, and when that is the inflation driver then it is a good thing, not
to be complained about.</p><p>I guess you can say human greed is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t. We are not greedy
inherently. We are not ruled deterministically by selfish genes. Tonnes of
artificial incentives and artificial scarcity make us greedy and artificially
competitive, primarily the excessive tax burden, which MMT claims is overkill.</p><h2 id=another-cup-of-fresh-mosler><a class=anchor href=#another-cup-of-fresh-mosler title='Anchor for: Another Cup of Fresh Mosler.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Another Cup of Fresh Mosler</h2><p>I was reading a good article by Freddie de Boer on the myths of elite
attitudes to education gaps. <strong>Quick for synopsis:</strong> turns out is is also
not about the money! Nuance: it is not about the <em>school</em>) funding. The top
funded school systems have no inherently better performance for students
outcomes. Gosh! I wonder why? What&rsquo;s more, poor black neighbourhood schools
in the USA receive more funding poor student than all other classes of
school. Yet no improvement in outcomes for learners! No surprises there.
But Freddie thinks the elites just refuse to know the facts. I think he is
partly right.</p><p>Turns out (and this was known from New Zealand research due to Prof. Roy Nash
a long time ago): what happens in the child&rsquo;s home is overwhelming in
importance.</p><p>So, in a way de Boer was a bit off. The money <em>does</em> matter, but it has to
be seen in terms of real resources and relief for over-burdened parents, to
free them up to choose to act wisely to support their kids. A single Mom
working for a living has no such choice. Funding her school to the hilt will
have almost zero impact (or near enough to zero) on her son or daughter
or unicorn.</p><p>Oh yeah, what about Warren?</p><p>I had a segment of text in the write-up about de Boer&rsquo;s article on
<a href=https://bijou.substack.com/p/freddie-alfie target=_blank>Ōhanga-pai substack</a>
.
The full article is below. See if you cna guess which bit I had Warren
check and proofread?</p><h3 id=freddie--alfie><a class=anchor href=#freddie--alfie title='Anchor for: Freddie $>$ Alfie.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Freddie $>$ Alfie</h3><p>This article by
<a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/elite-education-journalism-still?publication_id=295937&post_id=146011176" target=_blank>Freddie de Boer here</a>
is dynamite.
I could hardly agree with him more if someone whipped me with a Love Freddie
stick. Going all the way to Freddie > Alfie Kohn might be a stretch, but
hey, the two are a tag team really. Alfie is unbeatable on the “problem with
gold stars and rewards.” Freddie gets the money issue mostly right.<br>Synopsis: you can throw all the money at education you like, and the USA does!
It does not well correlate with improved outcomes for students. It is a
total myth the USA schools are not well funded. Poor black neighbourhood
schools are better funded per student. So why the persistent achievement
gaps? Freddie mostly criticizes the elites narrative (correctly in my view)
and touches on the proper “solution”. One critical thing elites are blind to
is the fact at home the kids from the wealthy households have far more
resources, which renders the public school funding amount largely moot.
Governments need to fund families, not just schools. But I wanted to amplify
a bit on de Boer, and correct some of his language framing.</p><p>First and foremost, the funding for public schools is not
“your tax payer dollars”. Mr de Boer utterly fails to realize he is
parroting disgusting right-wing talking points with the “tax payer dollars”
framing. All public funding is currency created from nothing by the government
votes in parliaments. It is a big part of the annual currency injection
(from nowhere but a keyboard at the central bank) that allows people to pay
the tax. What does this mean for correcting Freddie’s piece? It just means
“finding the money” is not the problem. There is always money if the
parliament votes to spend by hiring teachers and other resources, at any
wage rate moreover (it re-gauges the currency through relative price
adjustments &mdash; more people might move into teaching jobs if the pay relative
to office work is better, but this cannot guarantee
(nor correlate much at all with) better poor income family student outcomes!).
To spend the currency to pay teachers and hire resources for schools, no tax
payer needs to be anywhere in sight, and no one’s grandkids are held to
ransom. Someone at the central bank merely credits someone’s bank account
with a computer entry. On the government side of the ledger no bond is
needed, the currency can be booked as an increase in the private bank
reserves (a liability of the government). It is not first-order inflationary
if the government is paying the going price (not out-bidding the private
sector). To issue the currency to pay teachers and hire resources for
schools, no tax payer needs to be anywhere in sight, and no one’s
grand-kids are held to ransom. Someone at the central bank merely credits
someone’s bank account with a computer entry. On the government side of
the ledger no bond is needed, the currency can be booked as an increase in
the private bank reserves (a liability of the government). It cannot be
first-order inflationary if the government is paying the going price (not
out-bidding the private sector).</p><p>Freddie cocks it up when he criticizes the elite’s/normie meme, “if only
the funding was in the right area, if only the funding was spent wisely”.
He says this is unfalsifiable: if the education outcomes do not improve the
elite policy wonk just retreats to, “well you didn’t spend wisely.” True.
However, this is not as vacuous as de Boer makes out. It is, after all, a
tautology, so is true. The thing is to add the appropriate minimal real
world complexity to make it non-tautological and therefore a different
statement which is testable, hence informative. Mr de Boer gives such
standards, and they are the obvious ones. We need to worry about how safe,
comfortable, enriched intellectually, but also enriched spiritually, the
children and teens are in school but also at home! At home! The research
of Prof. Roy Nash as Massey University was critical in showing this! What
happens at home is of huge over-riding importance! But do not burden the
parents you policy wonks! Make sure the parents have material means for
living decent lives satisfied! But do not try to legislate for their moral
behaviour, that never works (see the research of Samuel Bowles). For moral
education people need to be free to make mistakes, because that exercises
their moral thinking. The critical thing is to ensure parents or guardians
have ample material needs satisfied, for then the temptation to choose poor
options (e..g, work overtime and underpaid for a shitty boss to get an
income) is minimized. Parents need to be free of financial fear so they at
least have the option to help their kids out a lot. Like say hours a day
if the kid wants the help. Cooking a nutritious & tasty meal is a learning
help, whether the child knows it or not. Overwhelming evidence tells us
students who love learning do well, regardless of innate genetics or
parenting or environment. But these are highly correlated! To love learning
it helps incredibly to have supportive unburdened parents, a clean and safe
home, a safe school, a wise teacher, and all the rest, and in particular some
decent nutritious food moving through your digestive system (turns out that
is linked to the brain, who would know?!! pffft!)</p><p>Mr de Boer makes a good point about the lower decile. Straight out of based
W. Edwards Deming. No matter what you do, there is always someone at the
bottom in any ordinal ranking. If they are living a decent life and are
enfranchised, then the gap to the top level skilled people in skill-level
is irrelevant, provided the wage and income gap is small, which it can be
made to be; moreover, who ever proved high skill correlates with high
emotional and spiritual capacity? No study I ever read. But which people do
I value more? I am sure you can divine the answer. When I want a brain
surgeon I’ll consent to the guy/gal not who knows a lot about brain surgery,
but in particular the guy/gal who makes fewer mistakes and fixes the problem,
and could care less about their bedside manner. But who do I spend most of
the time with? The lovely nurses who look after the patient pre and
post-surgery, that’s who, and their “skill” is predominantly in spiritual
qualities, not just fetching medicines and changing bandages. A robot could
probably do the latter.</p><p>It is not hopeless. Policy wonks like to complicate things beyond necessity,
but also end up with simplistic policy! What gives? It is because they are
viewing the world through a mainstream macroeconomics lens, and missing all
the humanity and spirituality that cannot be seen in a school or even a
classroom, but which is in every child’s soul. Nourish the soul. In practical
terms that means also nourishing the body, and all the rest. The very last
thing to worry about is test scores. If you want a child or teen or adult
to master a topic, keep teaching and helping until they master it. The test
score can always be 100% or near enough. If the person does not wish to
master a subject then why administer the test? If you fret about “standards”
then test the teacher, but test the teachers wisely, don’t make them conform
to your artificial standards either. So why is it not hopeless? Mr de Boer
gives the answer: nurturing learners is the critical thing. That’s just how
the human mind & soul learns best, particularly when the student challenges
themselves, so the test is inner and the reward is intrinsic (mastery,
confidence, fun of learning, etc., also renewed awareness of one’s relative
ignorance, hence hunger for more learning). None of this is hopeless to get
going. But it will exercise the tiny brains of education policy wonk elites,
because to them it seems an insurmountable obstacles to try to craft policy
to force people to enjoy learning. The policy wonks need re-education. You
cannot legislate for fun and enjoyment of learning, but what you can do is
release teachers and students from the shackles of standardized testing and
extrinsic reward motives, and free them into the wide open spaces of the
incredible fun of learning. To this end, while the Free School movement is
not perfect, nor is the Home School movement, both have valuable insights
from their systems that can be incorporated into public schools. Ditch the
authority figure top-down lesson plans, and get the students involved in the
lesson planning, with the guidance of humane teachers. Employ a few more
teacher aide workers, lord knows there are plenty of unemployed people who
can aide teachers without being a hazard to students. (Finding the money for
the wages, recall, is never the problem.)</p><p>The bottom line from the last comment is that, yeah, it does seem like an
intractable policy problem to make schools fun for students. So do not even
try. Trust people given autonomy and freedom, within reasonable social
constraints, will find a way to make learning fun. But imposing standardized
tests upon them will sure as hell kill the fun. There are the odd students
who love tests and exams, and who may even benefit therefrom. (My very own
daughter was one.) So… helllloooo! Give those students the exams. They can
take their own sweet innocent time to learn there is far more fun to be had.)<br>On this score: I had to listen to a university professor complain that the
NZCEA exams are not much use for him, he wanted percentage scores and stronger
criteria. I was too young at the time to critique, and I sort of agreed with
him. But now I know better. What’s the frickin’ harm in him giving prospective
university enrollees his own screening test? Lazy dude. He should not have to
rely on the high schools. Too much of a burden on his time? I would say it
is a university system problem. A university has ample time to prepare and
select students who can be admitted. They just don’t give themselves the
time. They could choose to give themselves the time. It will not kill anyone
prematurely. Why is a PhD entrance exam any more necessary than a freshman
entrance exam? If both are needed to screen out ill-equipped prospective
students then you should administer both. If such entrance criteria are not
needed then for goodness sake do not have an entrance exam. In the vast
majority of cases they will not be needed, since why is the student enrolling
if they do not want to put effort into learning? If the student is enrolling
to “earn credits” then you know the problem is the imposed need to earn
credits. So you need to remove that motive, and make sure the only reason a
student is enrolling in your course is to learn the subject, for whatever
reason they have in mind. In that case, who should care whatever they “qualify”
or not? Are they kind and sincere human beings? Are they non-disruptive to
the learning of others? Yes? OK, they qualify. What if your resulting class
size is too large? omg dude! Why would you complain? I just told you that
you do not have to mark 1000 exam papers… unless you want to torture yourself
and your students.</p><p>If you want “earning credits” to be useful, then, dear university professor,
use the UMKC buckeroo system. In order to receive their diploma each student
must work 20 hours at a course approved job out in the public or private
sector, or for a charity. One option could be to demonstrate their mastery
of the subject you taught, but out in the real world work place somewhere.<br>Wait…. what’s that you say? There is no real world workplace where your course
teaching is useful? Sheeesh. I don’t want to go full utilitarian. You never
go full utilitarian. OK, so what if you teach some weird poetry or art or
useless mathematics? There is an easy job such students could try out, which
is to sell someone such art for government tax credits. To get the 20 hours
in they could video their efforts. Could make for useful youtube comedy
entertainment? If they fail then it is no problemo, they might have learned
something in the effort.</p><p>I hope readers feel the fun of this article. If my language offends anyone

There is relevance here.</p><p>Gromov as aksed during hi Abel Prize interview about his thoughts on the
future. He reckoned 50 years out is &ldquo;same as usual&rdquo;. So the issues in
getting better mathematics work done are the same &mdash; talented kids go into
stupid areas of life, like finance. For 100+ years out he had an &ldquo;it is
unknown&rdquo; opinion, but warned of a total catastrophe if people cannot unify
and sort out the environmental and social unrest problems. He thought the
problems were solvable, but had no idea how.</p><p>I had some things I would like to suggest to Gromov:</p><ol><li>The problems are not of a mathematical or strictly economic nature. They
are spiritual. All the ills and crises facing the world at large are due to
roots in lack of spirituality. In particular among leadership and elites.</li><li>The fact the problems are spiritual in nature does not make them easier
to solve. But Gromov was worrying he had no analysis of the root of the
problem, therefore had no solution ideas to offer. Well, I&rsquo;ve just told him
the root of all the major problems.</li></ol><p>To be clear: water degradation and soil depletion and GHG climate disruptions
are not the real problems. They are drastic and serious symptoms. The
problems are spiritual.</p><p>No human being has any need to be living like an upper class American or
Chinese citizen. It does no harm, and an abundance of good, to have a happy
safe family living well below those levels of opulence. Once people
recognize the joy in such humility, we can easily solve the energy problems,
