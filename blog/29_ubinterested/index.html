the knife, so I had to write to defend MMT.</p><p>I am so bitter about this I cannot name names, because that would imply
friendly banter. I have to attack the ideas. There is <em>nothing</em> friendly about
UBI, the UBI is a direct frontal attack on the working class. I have to fight
back for workers.</p><p>When I name names, like Jason Hickel, Steve Keen, or Michael Hudson, or
Paul Krugman, or Richard Wolff, and have something against their ideas to say,
I&rsquo;m always doing it in a good faith friendly way. That&rsquo;s because I trust (some of)
these people. That is, I trust they are writing or speaking in good faith. Sometimes
I see their ideas are born out of ignorance (that&rsquo;s you Kruggers), and so results in
straw-manning MMT, but I can usually see where the fault lies, and so will not
shy from calling them out. I know full well I could be misinterpreting them, or
might even have things wrong myself on the facts.</p><p>However, <font style="color: #B87333;">UBI</font> and
<font style="color: #FFF380;">crypto-noncurrency</font> are different stories. These are things that
act directly against working class interests, and in the most insidious ways &mdash;
since it is not hard to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; a good decent honest working class pleb on these
ideas. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to get-rich-quick (crypto) or have free money without
earning it (UBI)? (Apart from me that is.)</p><p>Crypto is worse than gold, it is gold mentality without the gold, without a real
resource. What is the resource crypto relies upon? It is not &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; as the crypto
shills claim, since as Cory Doctorow has repeatedly warned, all electronic ledger
schemes and the like ultimately depend upon a legal framework and trust of people,
not encrypted software. People who think crypto has digitalised trust are delusional,
and have not fully thought it all through.</p><p>If you want &ldquo;proof-of-work&rdquo; how about showing me some muffins you made for lunch,
or some high energy electrons you produced to help fuel my GPU.
Phucckin&rsquo; crypto-phuckers.</p><p>Try waving your distributed ledger at an Afghan warlord whose land your ledger says
you own. (OK, that&rsquo;s not a real example, but it makes the point.)</p><p>Your crypto does not give you a claim on anything because no one promises to redeem.
If you can however find a bigger fool than you, you can take their <em>state currency</em>
(or drugs, or whatever) off them and give them your bitcoin. But that was not a
promise of redemption. The trust in the security of a digital ledger is not real
trust in humanity.</p><p>But this article is not the anti-crypto one, that&rsquo;ll come later.</p><h2 id=big-f-ing-problem-up-front><a class=anchor href=#big-f-ing-problem-up-front title='Anchor for: Big f-ing Problem Up-Front.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Big f-ing Problem Up-Front</h2><p>Hell yes people need money. We need state currency to pay tax liabilities and meet
reasonable savings desires (short of gross hoarding, i.e., sales for making profit
for the sake of profit and nothing else, no public interest just money fetish).</p><p>This is however not a case for UBI.</p><p>Only an idiot or neoliberal would consider UBI a necessity. Only a rentier would
consider UBI both necessary and good. Neoliberals practically make UBI seem like a
necessity. So I can understand in a neoliberal era people think UBI might be a good
idea. The point is we should work to destroy neoliberalism, not to patch it up with a
UBI. We should work to euthanise the rentiers, not feed them from the poisoned
wellspring of UBI.</p><h2 id=the-real-brainworms><a class=anchor href=#the-real-brainworms title='Anchor for: The Real Brainworms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Real Brainworms</h2><p>However, this &ldquo;patched-up neoliberalism&rdquo; idea is still brainworms. Even under
neoliberalism a UBI is a policy of lunatics. Why issue currency to people who
already have enough to pay taxes and keep some savings? It makes no sense.</p><p>If I am straw-manning the UBI shills forgive me, but pray-tell what is a UBI if
it is not universal? If it is not universal then stop calling it a UBI for godssake.</p><p>At worst
governments who are neoliberal could issue a <em>Basic Income Guarantee</em> so people do
not starve or suffer long term bank debt. From an MMT perspective (an anti-neoliberal
political economy if ever there was one) a Basic Income Guarantee is practical, fits
public purpose, and is wise and just. A UBI is all the opposite.</p><p>However, it is <em>how</em> a Basic Income Guarantee is implemented that matters, a BIG
itself can be done poorly to similarly undermine real wealth as a UBI would. So
even a BIG needs some considerate policy thought, not a welfare hand-out mindset.</p><blockquote><p>The correct mindset for a Job Guarantee and Basic Income Guarantee is reciprocity,
not welfare. All social welfare is produced and generated by the working class, not
by government hand-outs.</p></blockquote><p>UBI, in other words, is a giant &ldquo;fuck you!&rdquo; to workers. I am bitterly opposed to UBI.</p><p>Governments can always issue enough currency to meet our capacity to pay their
imposed tax liabilities plus our reasonable savings desires. No UBI is necessary
for this. Consider,</p><ol><li>Anyone able to contribute for public local community purpose can be recompensed
with a decent full living wage plus benefits. This is called reciprocity. It is
righteous.</li><li>Any social good anyone does living off a UBI hand-out or wage subsidy should be
recognized as a contribution to society meriting a decent living wage, not a social
welfare pittance.</li><li>UBI is a claim on someone else&rsquo;s labour &mdash; usually some poor worker in the global
south &mdash; and for nothing in return. UBI is disgusting.</li><li>Pensions and social welfare payments are called &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo; and are not a
UBI. They establish a type of BIG. But with full employment the BIG would be more
substantial, because real resources would be backing the claims the welfare
beneficiaries have rights, as member of society, to claim.</li></ol><p>UBI is anti-civilisation and pro-individualism and greed. UBI is the sick mentality
of, &ldquo;I exist, therefore I have a right to claim the fruits of someone else&rsquo;s labour
while providing them nothing real in return.&rdquo;</p><p>I am sure leftists who advocate a UBI simply <em>know not what they do.</em></p><h3 id=what-about-taxing-the-rich><a class=anchor href=#what-about-taxing-the-rich title='Anchor for: What About Taxing the Rich?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What About Taxing the Rich?</h3><p>There is no need to use a UBI as an excuse to tax the rich. If we do not want people
hoarding obscene amounts of state currency we should tax them because we do not want
people hoarding obscene amounts of state currency.</p><p>Currency hoarding of the obscene variety distorts democracy, and we would not need
any other excuse to tax obscene hoarders to the high hilt. They are not the job creators.</p><p>If you do run a UBI, the tax on the rich goes back to them as UBI + rents. There is
no public purpose served by such policy, it is profoundly regressive and does nothing
to generate real output people need today. If governments need to stimulate demand,
they can always choose to raise the minimum wage, and preferably by implementing a Job
Guarantee at a living wage floor.</p><p>It makes no sense to use a UBI for this purpose.</p><p>Any self-interested pursuit to u=skill or start a business, or other private
enterprise justifies bank credit. But if it also fits with a public purpose then such
skill training needs can be incorporated into a Job Guarantee scheme. A proper wage for proper work. If it fits public purpose it can be admitted into a Job Guarantee schedule, no further questions asked. No enterprising individual with greta ideas should have to fund their endeavour using a pittanc eof a UBI.</p><h3 id=what-about-human-freedom-and-liberty><a class=anchor href=#what-about-human-freedom-and-liberty title='Anchor for: What About Human Freedom and Liberty?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What About Human Freedom and Liberty?</h3><p>A Job Guarantee gives workers the power to tell exploitative employers to piss off. In
a monetary economy of any type (capitalist or socialist or a mix) there is hardly any
greater proletarian power short of a dictatorship of the proletariat (who are not
going to be running a UBI). But the Job Guarantee wage has to be a decent living
inclusive wage. UBI undermines the capacity to afford workers a decent living wage,
since a UBI adds all demand for zero supply.</p><p>UBI is pro-inflationary in a bad way.</p><p>A Job Guarantee is a counter-cyclical stabiliser, so is pro-inflationary only in a
credit crunch end of a cycle, so is deflationary on the way up, inflationary on the
way down, which is exactly what any wise person would recommend. A UBI on the other
hand, to act counter-cyclically, needs policy decision adjustment, which is not
automatic, so is not what we should want, since it&rsquo;ll keep us hostage to the policy
makers, who clearly do not always have public interest to heart.</p><p>UBI empowers fascism (I claim). Why? Because the hand-out is all up to the
government to dispense, like a Cesar. UBI firstly props up neoliberalism, and we
all know neoliberalism is the precursor to support for fascism. Yes, fascism always
ends, and never ends well, but we do not have to go through fascism to get to
socialism and/or liberal democracy without the austerity.</p><p>A Job Guarantee enshrined in Law is more freedom, since it is a claim the worker has
on the state. The UBI is a claim a non-worker has on someone else&rsquo;s labour. F-ing
disgusting.</p><h3 id=isnt-a-job-guarantee-fetishising-work><a class=anchor href=#isnt-a-job-guarantee-fetishising-work title='Anchor for: Isn&rsquo;t a Job Guarantee Fetishising &ldquo;Work&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Isn&rsquo;t a Job Guarantee Fetishising &ldquo;Work&rdquo;?</h3><p>F-off with that bullsh1t. Honest work for public service is righteous. There is no
implied fetish.</p><p>Slave labour for a boss who is producing crap and can sell it using clever
marketing or crony government subsidies, is the bullsh1t here. That&rsquo;s also
bullsh1t work. Yes, you should not fetishise bullsh1t work.</p><p>Work performed in the spirit of service to humanity is the opposite of this, it
is good, righteous and should only be encouraged and rewarded. In a monetary
economy claiming the work itself should be &ldquo;its own reward&rdquo; is bullsh1t.</p><p>I am thoroughly against &ldquo;volunteerism&rdquo;. If someone volunteers for public purpose
work, pay them. If the charity cannot pay them the government Job Guarantee can.
If they do not need the currency you can accept it back off them if they want to
donate and be considered a volunteer proper. The rightful &ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo; is the one
who volunteers to return their wages. But we have to pay them first, which is to
definitely <em>not</em> fetishise the labour, it&rsquo;s the opposite, it is recognition, not
fetishisation.</p><p>UBI shills are the fetishists here. The fetish of the false promise of
&ldquo;freedom from work.&rdquo;</p><p>If we get a boatload of machine automation there will still be work do to, the
good thing about automation is this new work could be almost 100% pleasant and
desirable, like solving difficult unsolved math problems, or producing amazing
art work that cannot be automated. We can redefine the meaning of work, it can
be service to humanity. That is a spiritual outlook, the opposite of a fetish.</p><h3 id=isnt-social-welfare-already-a-ubi-of-sorts><a class=anchor href=#isnt-social-welfare-already-a-ubi-of-sorts title='Anchor for: Isn&rsquo;t Social Welfare Already a UBI of Sorts?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Isn&rsquo;t Social Welfare Already a UBI of Sorts?</h3><p>&ldquo;&mldr; so why not ramp up social welfare and run a UBI policy, huuh?&rdquo;</p><p>That would be retarded.</p><p>Social welfare payments and pensions are <em>not UBI</em>. Pensions and social welfare
are simply good policy if you want a civilised society where we take care of all.
Especially we take care of those who lack the capacity to take care of themselves.</p><p>How do we do that best? Not with currency. We do it with work, to produce socially
necessary output people first of all <em>need</em> to live a decent life, and second of all
desire to consume sustainably. Paying people living wages, not slave wages, to do the
sometimes sh1t but not bullsh1t work is how we do this.</p><p>The currency is on the back-end to ensure fair distribution, not to generate the
output.</p><p>I know UBI is strong in Scandanavia, Alaska, Canada and South Africa. Please stay
away from New Zealand, we don&rsquo;t want you phuckers around here destroying our
politics (TOP Party get lost you bastard over-educated liberal elite wankers).</p><h2 id=not-a-good-argument---but-who-supports-ubi><a class=anchor href=#not-a-good-argument---but-who-supports-ubi title='Anchor for: Not a good argument - but who supports UBI?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Not a good argument - but who supports UBI?</h2><p>Apart from insane libertarians, the major supporters of UBI are dorks like
Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos. (Also dorks like the late David Graeber
whose other work I respect and admire. Good people can say stupid sh1t.) Actually I
do not know they do support UBI, but people like them do. They know they need workers
to buy their crap. They do not want to fairly pay their workers. So&mldr; UBI man!
(Cock-suuuuckeeers.)</p><p>Good enough argument for me against UBI.</p><h3 id=how-is-ubi-not-a-trojan-horse-for-capital><a class=anchor href=#how-is-ubi-not-a-trojan-horse-for-capital title='Anchor for: How is UBI Not a Trojan Horse for Capital?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How is UBI Not a Trojan Horse for Capital?</h3><p>I am not a social scientist, so can only speculate here, but it seems to me
people who support UBI are people who are one or more of: (a) completely blind
to class warfare, (b) ignorant of macroeconomics, (c) are well-to-do and have a
legitimate concern for the poor, but who also lack a proper class analysis,
(d) out-right neoliberals, or maybe non-authoritarian authoritarians.</p><p>Point (d)** concerns people who do not even realise it is a form of lauding it over
the poor to offer them a UBI hand-out. I call it welfarism. It is gross. The
spiritual principle is to give to people <em>before they are in need of welfare or
charity</em>. UBI is, no mistake about it, charity form the state. But it is worse,
since it goes to everyone, so is not charity. It looks like charity, but it is not
charity.</p><p>There is no dignity in receiving charity. Charity is good. But the point is we should
work so that it is not needed. The point of charitable organizations is to put
themselves out of business.</p><p>A UBI cheque can only get you what workers are willing to be subjugated to
produce. No one really wants to work. Everyone would rather play. But someone has
to work.</p><p>When the State uses welfare policy as the anti-poverty lever, it is creating
dependency. Social welfare needs to be a safety net, for correction of government
policy mistakes, and the goal should be to eliminate those mistakes. When we
eliminate the policy mistakes that create a need for welfare then we have greater
human dignity and greater freedom from oppression. Having to depend upon charity s a
form of oppression. That doesn&rsquo;t mean giving out of charity or state welfare is a bad
thing, it is not, it is a good thing when it is needed. The superior idea is to build
a society where it is not needed. UBI does next to nothing to help with this.</p><p>What? Do you think people relying on a UBI are just going to rise up, self-organize,<br>and provide private social services themselves out of the goodness of their hearts?</p><p>The way we eliminate need for charity is to provide people with the goods and
services they need to live a decent life. This is why on the progressive left side of
politics we always favour the superior &ldquo;universality&rdquo; abstraction of Universal Basic
Services. A nation should be able to democratically decide what they want as UBS, and
if they can be resourced the state can always make the payments.</p><p>No UBI is needed.</p><p>If the state uses a UBI policy then all that happens without public Universal Basic
Services is the private for-profit corporations offer the services instead, along
with wasteful advertising and marketing crud, and concomitant real cots that are
needless, and all for soaking up the government UBI handout.</p><p>This is what we mean by UBI being a Trojan Horse for the rentier class. They will
gobble up your UBI by providing services the government is not providing, at much
higher social and environmental real costs. Pretty darn crazy. It is not progressive
politics.</p><p>Do not think for one minute the tax &ldquo;pay for&rdquo; the UBI will help lower inequality. It
will not. All taxes on the upper class and owners of capital get passed through to
consumers. The UBI leaves the working class no better off <em>in relative terms</em> than
before when they were in debt to banksters.</p><h3 id=how-does-it-work-then-in-alaska-and-norway><a class=anchor href=#how-does-it-work-then-in-alaska-and-norway title='Anchor for: How Does it Work Then in Alaska and Norway?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How Does it Work Then in Alaska and Norway?</h3><p>Where UBI seems to work (to reduce extreme poverty) it is always the case someone
else is paying for it, and in real terms. Norway and Alaska sell oil. Someone else
is paying for that, and those costs are passed on to workers somewhere else. There is
also the environmental cost incurred, currently unaccounted for, and it is a
significant real cost. That&rsquo;s the sort of cost that truly is going to be a burden for
our grandchildren.</p><p>If I were a decently paid worker in Alaska or Norway I would refuse to accept
the UBI on principle. I imagine you would think that to be pretty extreme. So also
imagine the spiritual violence of the psychological hypocrisy burden were I living
in a UBI nation without a decent wage?</p><p>We also know the Andrew Yang version of UBI is a &ldquo;tax on the rich pay-for&rdquo; which
is an utter chimera. Rich people already have abundant savings. They do not like
getting taxed, so will seek all means necessary to reduce their tax burden, which
means the real cost is always passed off onto the poor, ultimately. Even if the tax
pay-for reduced private wealth, that does not limit the power of the rich. They
still will have savings, so will still have leverage power.</p><p>This whole meme of the &ldquo;good rich&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Please tax me! Please!&rdquo; is sad and
hilarious at the same time.</p><p>If they were serious they&rsquo;d just give away all their spare cash. Why wait for the
tax man to do it?</p><h2 id=future-prospects><a class=anchor href=#future-prospects title='Anchor for: Future Prospects.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Future Prospects</h2><p>If you are one of those who currently support UBI and are ignorant of MMT, fair
enough, but please go educate yourself. If you still support UBI do not thank me
later for warning you about the ills of UBI. Just your thinking
alone makes me ill and I want nothing to do with you, let alone your actual policy
implementation. I do not want or need your thanks. I&rsquo;d rather you think for
yourself and work it out, without a bitter person like me to tell you not to sh1t
all over the working class.</p><p>If humanity sorts itself out more peacefully and in unity then we will see a small
Job guarantee program in every country and expanded public sector employment for
skilled workers. I do have some optimism about this, because not everyone on this
planet is batshit stupid. And even UBI shills are not necessarily greedy selfish
people, they&rsquo;re just ignorant and lazy in their thinking. I can tolerate a bit of
laziness. Especially the mathematical, engineering, and programming kind, which
work their butts off today to a ridiculous degree just to avoid harder work tomorrow,
thus tomorrow freeing up time to do more engineering they&rsquo;d otherwise not have time
to do. And why?
