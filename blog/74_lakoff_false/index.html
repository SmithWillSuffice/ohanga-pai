It was interesting
(and ironic gioven his politicla preferences) how Lakoff is so ignorant
of state monetary operations that he regularly false frames taxation and
welfare issues.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9R9MtkpqM" target=_blank>Here</a>
is the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9R9MtkpqM" target=_blank>lecture for reference</a>
.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant little lecture, but I had to post a long comment.</p><blockquote><p>Lakoff himself is guilty of false framing. Regarding &ldquo;big government&rdquo;
and taxation, etc., he fails to realize all US dollars come from the
government or via credit from the chartered agents of the State (licenced
private banks &mdash; they are part of government) the US﹩ does not come from
anywhere else (it&rsquo;d be counterfeit). So tax return is a &ldquo;return back to the
issuer&rdquo;, from the French, revenir. It is not a funding operation for the
government, it is a redemption (the US﹩ is an I.O.U,. of the State: &ldquo;I owe
you redemption for one unit of imposed tax liability.&rdquo;).<br>      So &ldquo;my tax dollars&rdquo; are not funding
anything. They came from government from inception. The government issued
that currency by spending (or a bank issued credit in circulation, but that
is not net US﹩ creation, since there is a debt on the other side of the
ledger). All the dollars spent by the government not yet used to pay taxes
are the non-government sector&rsquo;s net financial wealth in US﹩. The false frame
is to call that &ldquo;our debt&rdquo;. It is in fact our ﹩ wealth. The debt on the other
side of the ledger is that the USGov promises to accept back Its currency
when you pay taxes. If it refuses to redeem your tax liabilities it is in
default and has not honoured Its debt. The US Gov is at least acting &ldquo;morally&rdquo;
because it never seems to refuse to redeem, it always accepts your tax payment.<br>      The moral obligation is more serious
though: by imposing taxes in currency no one initial has, the government
creates unemployment (people seeking to earn the tax credit). The government
must then spend sufficient to permit the &ldquo;economy&rdquo; to pay all the imposed tax,
plus meet savings desires, otherwise it made a terrible policy blunder and
caused residual employment, a simple policy mistake, not a market force.<br>      If there are net savers around (they need
not be billionaires, anyone who nets saves is forcing someone else to net
spend) then the government should be running a deficit (spending more than
tax return) otherwise the government is by local accounting identity placing
some people somewhere in needless debt to a private bank.<br>      Interestingly, some conservatives
understood this. In a very twisted way. The folks working for Reagan and
Bush knew government deficits were necessary, since by accounting identity
the government deficit is the private sector surplus &mdash; while simultaneously
&ldquo;blaming&rdquo; Democrats for the government deficits! Orwellian in the extreme! &mdash;
they just wanted most of the surplus to go to the Top One Percent, not the
poor via hiring all the unemployed the tax liabilities created.<br>      Reagan was right (though still racist)
to not want &ldquo;welfare Queens&rdquo;, but he was disingenuous, he could have made
them all go away by hiring them all for public service in decent meaningful
jobs. There is no end to work needing done, we wake up every day to severe
labour shortages, but the private sector will not hire the unemployed, they
do not want them, they want people already working, so a demand stimulus
will usually just cause a wage demand spiral, leaving people still unemployed
and wasted. Only the monopoly currency issuer can hire all the unemployed
without causing inflation, since the private sector bid for the unemployed
labour is zero. (Not that moderate inflation is bad mind you, it is a good
thing if the real wage is rising. A bit of inflation erodes the purchasing
power of hoarded tax credits.)</p></blockquote><h2 id=love-sets><a class=anchor href=#love-sets title='Anchor for: Love Sets.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Love Sets</h2><p>From <em>Metaphors We Live By</em> there is this idea we use spatio-temporal
adjectives and metaphors to describe distinctly non-spatio-temporal
concepts.</p><ul><li>Mary is imprisoned in her marriage.</li><li>Maya is in cahoots with Martin.</li></ul><p>et cetera. All fine and good. But what Lakoff & Johnson too casually dismiss,
to their detriment, is that &ldquo;space&rdquo; and &ldquo;time&rdquo;, while objective elements of
reality imho, are nevertheless <em>mental constructs</em> we use to make sense of
patterns presented to our mind.</p><p>For the former (the elements of reality) we could tell this if we
supposed animals were non-conscious Zombies. (Maybe some are! Who the hell
knows.)</p><p>Which is more important then, the idea of a <em>space</em> or the more abstract
notion of membership (of a set or class)? I&rsquo;d argue membership is perhaps
the more primitive. Just a musing.</p><p>So &ldquo;being in love&rdquo; is membership of the set of people in the state of
adoration of their beloved.</p><p>So what of spacetime and other proper spaces with measures? Well, is it not
a prejudice to say those spaces have measures, and the set
<strong><font style="color: hotpink">Love</font></strong> does
not? Counting things in a set is a measure.</p><p>Alright then, so what is so proper and special about a manifold or a
spacetime? What is so special is that we <em>live</em> in one of them!
Objects embedded in spacetime share all the symmetries and laws thereby
associated, which unites us as a One. (What?&mldr; too commie??)</p><p>We are not all fortunate enough to be in the set
<strong><font style="color: hotpink">Love</font></strong> and we are all, for now,
stuck in the set <strong><font style="color: dodgerblue">Spacetime</font></strong>.
A huge aspect of the struggle of human civilization (and I presume the
Trisolarians too) is to survive in this particular matrix and find peace
and harmony while doing so, it is any civilizations calling.</p><p>Those who think life is all about conflict and competition have it
all backwards. Those effects seen in natural evolution are the
pathologies that are the norm, precisely because the spiritual is too
often ignored. (Lakoff & Johnson guilty here.)</p><p>The better way to think about language is that all the physical/material
concepts are the metaphors, and they spring from the spiritual, not the
other way around. (This is why no respectable neoliberal politicians want
to be near my thought cloud proximity.)</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../73_m_again_but_aged_well>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../75_rbnz_cretans>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../73_m_again_but_aged_well>M Again, de-Age</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../75_rbnz_cretans>RBNZ Cretans</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
