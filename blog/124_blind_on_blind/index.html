<em><a href=https://americanexception.com/author/aaron_good/ target=_blank>American Exception</a></em>
is critical, otherwise much of this below will just sound like loony bin
conspiracy theory. Although knowing of Aaron since the old Michael J Brookes
days, it is only relatively recently since reading more works like
Whitney Webb&rsquo;s One Nation Under Blackmail)_ that I really appreciated
the critical importance of Good&rsquo;s main thesis.</p><p>That is because in the past I would have naïvely believed the nominal
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; state does have the power to overcome the overworld and
underworld deep state, just by virtue of sheer numbers in Parliaments, and
popular working class support.</p><p>If a politicians is good, then they will not need organized labour.
Organized labour is essential because politicians are generally not very
good (which can mean maybe they have kind hearts, but are clueless what can
be done with a kind heart &mdash; the answer is to not ever worry about getting
re-elected, instead just do the right thing.) In fact, when campaigning,
you do not even want to worry about not getting elected, you want to be
worrying about the ꕷꖾꕯꖡ you&rsquo;ll have to face if you <em>are</em> elected. Better
to not get elected. That&rsquo;s an individualist veiw of course, not collectivist.
We would rather they do get elected, the kind-hearted candidates that is.</p><p>I realize USA Congress is not quite there yet. But I do extend AE to all
western nations, even non-western nations, since the bribery and blackmail
is, or so I believe, fairly universal. But enough good people work in
enough governments in the &ldquo;Madisonian&rdquo; institutions to thwart the deep sate.</p><p>The worry I have in more recent times is that the USA deep state infects
more than just the USA, and the UK is congenitally joined to the USA, and
New Zealand umbilically still attached in many minds to the UK, if not by
import/export co-dependence anymore.</p><p>I would just guess that New Zealand is already controlled by neoliberalism,
so is not in &ldquo;need&rdquo; of gangsters. These days though, you have to give
that a second thought. Why was Adern&rsquo;s cabinet unable to pass a
Job Guarantee for example, to eliminate child poverty? That was her basic
platform and reason for being PM.</p><h2 id=tinder-fire><a class=anchor href=#tinder-fire title='Anchor for: Tinder Fire?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Tinder Fire?</h2><p>Where is the fire?</p><p>One other reason Aaron&rsquo;s work has &ldquo;excited&rdquo; me recently, is because
of the near deafening silence on the recognition of the core problems
of our governmental systems.</p><p>People seem to be blaming the bad apples. But it is a systemic failure,
requiring radical overhaul, and courageous politicians and public servants
are needed, and we there to support them fully and I&rsquo;d say almost
unconditionally support them.</p><p>There is a good to government, what political scientists in Aaron&rsquo;s vein
refer to as the <em>Madisonites</em>. The security state are the <em>Trumanites</em>,
and the deep-state mafiosi (overworld + underworld) are the third part
of tripartite government.</p><p>Only two fo these are illegitimate aspects of government.</p><p>All three exist I believe to some extent in all nations, except maybe
small island nations.</p><p>The one legitimate form of government is what people tend to blame and
criticize, but this is horrifically misdirected anger. It is blaming the
vicom almost. Blaming the powerless.</p><p>The reason why people forming the nominal democratic state are so
pathetic (for the most part) is because there is a self-selection
process in play, the more careerist insipid and feckless &ldquo;big speakers&rdquo;
&ldquo;little thinkers&rdquo; are the ones offered up to you to vote for. There is
also self-sortition once they get into Parliament. The &ldquo;team players&rdquo; get
the juicy portfolios, the more neoliberal you are the closer to the
Finance Minster. A totally rotting system, but mainly because of the
workings of the other two aspects of tripartite government, security
state and deep sate. So it is wasting your breathe, largely, to point
fingers at and curse those who happen to rise to the seats in the
democratic face of government.</p><p>If you think, &ldquo;we have no hope&rdquo; that is because deep down you know these
democratic actors are largely just that, mere actors. It is not really
their fault. They&rsquo;re often just as much victim as you and me. Hey&mldr; not
that I am making excuses for them, that&rsquo;s not what i am doing. I am saying
activist effort has to get smarter, and divulge the root causes of
corruption of <em>our</em> government.</p><p>We would be half all-right if there only was this one legitimate form
of government. It is a whole ideology and paradigm that brings the overworld
and underworld aspects of government into power and all but completely
dominating the one legitimate form of government, which is the nominal
democratic state. The nominal democratic states need to be made the real,
not just the nominal. This can only happen if the tow other blocs of
government are completely abolished.</p><p>How? Well, that&rsquo;s not for today, but I can tease more writing on this in
the weeks ahead, which I am sure no one of any significant influence is
reading, but it&rsquo;s &ldquo;out there&rdquo; anyway as evidence that am I still not
requiring pharmaceutical anti-depressants. But although you may feel of
no significant influence, you certainly are not when united with other
workers.</p><p>Thus a wieser leftist activism is needed, and towards this end many
elements of conservative thought are not altogetrh our enemies, provided
only they are pro-worekr and anti-oligarch. The cultural wars thus have to
be placed squarely in the background. Why, after all, do women in several
USA states now not have a legal right of choice? It is not because
of &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=oil-is-no-longer-the-target><a class=anchor href=#oil-is-no-longer-the-target title='Anchor for: Oil is No Longer the Target?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Oil is No Longer the Target?</h2><p>When a predatory state can control information then who pumps oil up out of
the ground and sells it is almost irrelevant, provided they can be controlled.</p><p>However, countering this, we have empires always collapse," hubris, clown
fascism, and all the rest &mdash; which speaks to maybe the information
tyrants &mdash; the tech oligarchy &mdash; could be undermined by the more physical
overworld of the deep state.</p><p>In the end, oil and <em>energy</em> in general, is the target. Which means deep
state mafia-state actors need to be watched out for in solar, geothermal,
wind and other &ldquo;green&rdquo; energy sources. The new Oil is whatever we get energy
from. There is of course an horrendous nexus here in the uranium mining
and processing sector, for obvious reasons. Uranium is, in this abstract
generalization, merely very densified Oil!</p><p>Even if the trade in nuclear weapon tech is kept in the underworlds and
overworlds, it is still a form of Drug Trade. These dark markets are not all
dark, they appear on the stock exchanges in open sight, so are indeed both
underworld and overworld, and the point is not to create a nuclear war to
overthrow the pinkos and commies (where are they exactly?) but to perpetuate
the criminal enterprise of the oligarchic world order. It is almost blasphemous
to call it &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo;, since that construct &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; is a total
ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ cartoon idea which K. Marx and others had completely absurd
idealistic idea about, cloaked in the false fabric of Materialism.</p><p>There is no such thing.</p><p>Private ownership of the means of production is ancient, preceding the
Enclosures, And in modern form the political economy barely has anything
resembling the popular understanding known as &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; &mdash; private
ownership of the workers, profit motive, government stays out of markets (yet
creates the markets)!</p><p>In a sense &mdash; and this is where I would extend Aaron Good&rsquo;s thesis &mdash;
Capitalism is largely a distraction and a giant Limited Hangout itself.
Because &ldquo;capitalists&rdquo; have never been the problem.</p><p>To prove the point, just imagine ownership of the means of production was
all in worker cooperatives. Well, they&rsquo;d be capitalists.</p><p>So it has never been a crisis of capitalism. It&rsquo;s always been the
aristocracy, the oligarchy and the plutocracy, melded at the weird Siamese
hip with the underworld of organized crime. governments and capitalistic
firms are just highly superficial outward facing manifestations of this
much broader Deep State, which has never been exclusive to the USA. To think
the Deep State is a mainly USA imperialist problem is laughable. It&rsquo;s not
even traced back to British imperialism. It goes back much further. How do
you think the Pharoahs commanded the working class? By magical thought
control? No. It&rsquo;s always been a mafia underworld doing the dirty work,
since time immemorial.</p><p>Today, we the workers, just have to stand up and say &ldquo;No more.&rdquo; We are done.
Murder us, cripple us, but we make the milk and bread, so you are not going
to survive without us, but we are not going to let you pretend anymore that
our plight of poverty is something we deserved by not saving up enough
government scorepoints.
We know your underbelly, and it is not just privilege and influence thanks
to the hoarded government scorepoints, it is your usage of a vast criminal
underworld too.</p><p>BTW, that&rsquo;s the most contradictory thing about capitalism: the idea the
government creates markets (government is the currency monopolist) and yet is
told to stay out of markets. As my earlier essay this year remarked, there is
never a contradiction. There is only something you are missing. In this case
it is that the governments are by-in-large controlled by deep state overworld
and underworld criminal enterprises, the former colloquially known as the
oligarchy or plutocracy, fthe latter known as the mafia (thought that is
generalized, not restricted to Italian mobs of course, it&rsquo;s world-wide
multicultural organized crime).</p><p>What sustains oligarchy, plutocracy, aristocracy and despotism is both
material and idealistic. The material side os of course the obvious lust
for riches and control over things to do with food, drugs, sex, and other
base psychological drivers. But the idealist side is equally important, the
lust over having lots of government scorepoints, the influence that entails,
the psychology of needing to have more Mercedes and whathaveyou than the
neighbour, and control over sexualized/objectivized celebrity culture, and
all the rest.</p><p>When I say &ldquo;all the rest&rdquo; I leave that up to your imagination, since
whatever you imagine is likely something I&rsquo;d agree with, it&rsquo;s just too
long a list to state explicitly and I am lazy, and do not like the literary
style of making lists and citing &ldquo;documentation&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s for lawyers.</p><h2 id=reality-tv-show><a class=anchor href=#reality-tv-show title='Anchor for: Reality TV Show?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Reality TV Show?</h2><p>Speaking of lawyers, there is a good use for them in my view. I&rsquo;d like to
pitch to any film producers right here a concept for a &ldquo;actually good&rdquo;
Netflix/HBO show. (Whichever production company is not funded and propped up
by the deep state!)</p><p>We stage TV court trials of all the war criminals in history, and all the
SCAD (State crimes against democracy). There&rsquo;s an endless source, but bulk
stuff could short the Season-021. The entire Bush-II administration for
example. The cliff hanger questions being whether naïve boy scuts like
Col. Larry Wilkerson escape conviction of war crimes, and only his boss
gets the Reality TV jail time.</p><p>season 1 would be the lower ranks of the deep state, the mostly unrecognizable
names in the popular consciousness, like James Angleton, Meyer Lansky and
that crowd. Season-2 would be riskier and would but say LBJ and Cheney
on trial (among many others). And Season-3 even spicier putting living
persons like Clinton, Blair, Obama &ldquo;and all the rest&rdquo; on trial.</p><p>I&rsquo;d want creative control of course! 🤣</p><p>The insistence would just be to keep it at an historical documentary level,
not to descend into sensationalist Reality TV. It&rsquo;d by hyper-reality TV.
A fitting end curtain I should say to the postmodern era (defined as the
political economy of the ends times of &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; &mdash; though as remarked
above, it is nothing like &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; and never has been.)</p><p>Just say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and send me the royalties when you can, ok?</p><p>But you know, I&rsquo;d produce the show deadly seriously, without actors. Except
for the dead guys and Thatchers/Adelsons/Clintons.</p><p>I will be pitching this to film studios and writer&ndash;producers, but if
someone steals the idea and gets there ahead of me, well great. Saves me the
effort. I don&rsquo;t want the royalties really. But if any of you do grab this
idea, just for heavens sake don;&rsquo;t slop-it-up like a clown Relaity show.
The whole idea worth &ldquo;patenting&rdquo; is dto do the whole thing as a damn serious
court trial, like of The Hague proportions &mdash; Season-4 is placing the
institution of the Hague on trial for gross incompetence and intelligences,
and bring the case The Hague has itself been nazified or at least mafiarized,
and in some ways is the pinnacle of Limited Hangout.</p><p>Season-5 is the United Nations.</p><p>That&rsquo;s getting very hyper-real.But there is a case to be made. The UN is
the correct institution for international peace & harmony, but it is
thoroughly corrupted, so while the UN needs to be put on trial, the concept
is like the 2008 GFC crisis response: you fire the management, but do not
need to close down the bank (which serves no public purpose). (Banks are not
the problem. Failure to regulates banks wisely is the problem. Payments
clearing is a boring uncorruptible operation, and so banks shoudl be
thoroughly boring public institutions. Hence all banking corruption is
some else, something other than payments clearing operations.)</p><p>I guess maybe Season-5 should be the banking/monetary system on trial, since
this is the crucial MMT prosecution case. Then Season-6 would be the
United Nations.</p><p>Anyway, just in case there are some royalties down the road, this essay is
a public document I am submitting as proof the concept was my idea, and I am
informally copylefting or patenting it&mldr; or whatever!! The point being not
to flash this around in a Torts Court to get my royalties, but just that if
I can use this to get the royalties then it would only be to make sure I do
not die of starvation and everything on top of coffee, sandwiches and rents,
goes to a pool of funds for worker organization at the grass roots.</p><p>Apologies of course to anyone who has already slide-deck prepared and
pitched this Reality TV concept to studios. I&rsquo;m to trying to crowd-in.</p><p>My plea here is for exquisite artistry. I hate Reality TV. I hate &ldquo;TV&rdquo;. But
there is a beautiful irony of &ldquo;exploiting&rdquo; Reality TV if done really well,
professionally, and really just &ldquo;stick some cameras&rdquo; in a fake courtroom, and
get real lawyers to litigate all these crimes against humanity. It is only
necessary because our real world institutions are not doing the job. So in
postmodernist times we practically only have the artificial reality format
to to it ourselves.</p><p>While theatre, I think the concept should be firmly in the production crew
mind that we are putting people and institutions on trial in a worldwide
court of public opinion, and the farce that it will be a &ldquo;Netflix&rdquo; show is
the obvious whole point! The working class today have very few other
actionable options for tearing down the ancient tens of thousands year long
aristocracy that began with the concept of village chiefs, social bullies,
and medicine men, Mandarins, the elites who &ldquo;know better,&rdquo; so you and I have
to just &ldquo;shut up or take a hike!&rdquo;</p><p>I want the entire production crew, right down to the dame marketing
department, to be fully on-board. If some of them a deep-staters then I&rsquo;d
want them to just be gutsy enough to say so, we could use their insights
on the show! But no script-writers. The players in the show will be
professional lawyers and researchers, like Aaron, prepared to put in
the time to make the whole production a realistic court drama. In other
words, at times, boring 𝕒𝕗 . Since we&rsquo;ll want to the resources available
film the back-stories too, how the lawyers would prepare for such aa case
in real-life. So a parallel documentary of the &ldquo;Making of the Cae
against the Deep State.&rdquo;</p><p>Getting near the end of my pitch now.</p><p>The next thing to make clear is the purpose. It is not to make profit off
just another Reality TV concept. No. It is not just entertainment and
distraction (pomo CIA plant etc). No. The purpose, explicitly, overtly and in
every other way, is <strong>public education</strong>. There is <em>no other purpose</em> to this
film/TV concept proposal.</p><p>If such a Reality Show appears that is pure entertainment, fictionalized,
with actors and scripts, then that is not my idea, and I&rsquo;d&rsquo; want no royalties
therefrom, even if someone forced them to appear in my bank account.</p><p>Why? Because in my view once the purpose weighted to more than about 20%
entertainment or profit motivated, then it is corrupted. (NB: Education should
be about 10% to 20% entertainment, all the good teachers have an inner
stand-up comedian or Shakespeare in them.)</p><p>The idea is that it will be &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; (in the dark sort of way)
automatically simply because of the whole concept.</p><p>Just keep in mind, if such an entertainment show is done crassly for
entertainment, like a typical USA style Reality TV show, that is not mine,
I do not want royalties form that ꕷꖾꔇꖡꗍ. The proper concept is as near
to real criminal trial as has ever been done in real life. I mean by this,
not even the OJ Trial. The OJ or Johnny Dep style trials is precisely not
what we want to do. I am thinking more like New Zealand criminal court
proceedings, at the highest level, white collar crime stuff. There is no
sensationalism involved at all. (So also not the Winston Peters&rsquo; Winebox
inquiry style, which was political theatre for an ideologue&rsquo;s benefit &mdash;
albeit the actual case was a real example of criminal cover-up.)</p><p>I guess this would make the production ever <em>more</em> hyper-real_ or really
surreal, since without media/press sensationalism it would not be like
the real world. You know the deal, more like old school leftist BBC or
Swedish cinema rather than commercial crap Hollywood production style.
Keep the ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ Peter Jackson away from it too.</p><p>(Is there anything more
British imperialist fascist than LOTR? Sauron was the anti-hero all along,
the pinko commie nice guy? A good guy, but demonized and propagandized to
all heck by the drug cartel funded Shire, and portrayed as an evil SOB in
