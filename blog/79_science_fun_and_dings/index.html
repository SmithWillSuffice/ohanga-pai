(a) I don‚Äôt have the time, and (b) it is a major stimulant for anxiety and
depression. But I did manage to click the appropriate pixels on my browser
page to see what Mike Norman had to say about the recent dis-inversion of
the yield curve. Below I‚Äôll attempt a mini synopsis, and finish with my take
on the story. Let me emphasize: no one should bother paying any attention to
me, especially not the ‚Äúpaying‚Äù. But if this amuses you, delights you, or
motivates you to get into macroeconomic justice activism, then my job is
well done. (This is not Millennial Gen false modesty and fake absurdist
self-deprecation, it is just fact, since my expertise is in physics.)</p><p>Actually, I am going to invert this essay, and start with my take on the
situation, then afterwards go through the terminology and the dynamics a bit.
(Non-technical, no math. Apologies to the nerds.) The challenge is to offer
a decent honest &ldquo;explainer&rdquo; using only cartoons. This is an art, and I&rsquo;m no
Rembrandt at it, and my pencil is just words and letters, but I hope I find
some appreciators.</p><h2 id=the-normanator><a class=anchor href=#the-normanator title='Anchor for: The Normanator.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Normanator</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdiCqXjcNtI" target=_blank>Mike Norman</a>
puts out an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdiCqXjcNtI" target=_blank>episode of his podcast</a>
claiming the Monetarists have it all backwards again. For all previous history
they scream &ldquo;murder&rdquo; (or &ldquo;recession&rdquo;) when the
<a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp target=_blank>bond market yield curve inverts</a>
&mdash; meaning short term
yields on bonds go higher than long term yields. I will try to explain
later the (false) logic why the &lsquo;Monetarists&rsquo; (read: almost all mainstream
economists) think an inverted yield curve signals a recession.</p><p>OK, but today, Mike notes, the Monetarists are changing their tune: now it
is a dis-inverted yield curve that signals a recession. (MoneyTsarist:
‚ÄúHaha! Psyche. We knew this all along, we were only kidding before,
couldn‚Äôt you tell?‚Äù. ü§£ )</p><p>((Ooops! Big linguistic pun error? When you think about it, it is really
the MMT extremist who is the ‚ÄúMoneyTsarist‚Äù.))</p><p>Mike then points out there was no recession after the yield curve inverted a
few years ago, and there will be none. He then claims the yield curve
dis-inverting (going back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; with future yields higher than
current yields) is also not a cause of a recession, but later on there might
be a recession, say next year.
<em><em>But</em></em> it is <em>because</em> the FED${}^\dagger$ votes as a committee to lower
the interest rate that we get recession risk.</p><p>Thus, a dis-inverted yield curve in isolation means nothing, since the bond
market is purely parasitic on the real economy, and serves as nothing but a
regulator for interest-income to people who already have money. It also
helps tighten the torture apparatus screws on households who cannot avoid
bank debt, but that&rsquo;s another story, because in one regressive trickle-down
way or another the rich c_nts have to get this income into the pockets of
the middle class (at least) to keep up sales. Right. So if this trickle down
fails and gets clogged up by neoliberal brain excretions in the pipes, then
a recession is very likely. Sales dropping off is always the main damage.
The spiral of lay-offs & hence declining sales leading to more lay-offs, then
the epidemic-like nature of unemployment spreads like a nasty virus.</p><p>${}^\dagger$ &ldquo;The FED&rdquo;: the US central bank, a branch of government
with limited policy setting authority and regulatory authority. (Just had to
state it, in case any libertarians are reading.)</p><p>Short story then: Mike was right. Or will be vindicated if things play out
with interest rate cuts absent fiscal policy adjustments to keep demand
steady.</p><p>As I inferred though, it is a double edged sword. The rich c_nts lose
interest-income, but so what? They already had money, and can still purchase
whatever they need, just less of it, or the yacht that doesn&rsquo;t have the
NSA/CIA GPS, only the NASA GPS. The poor get a lower debt burden, which is
good, but not as high a wage growth with which to pay-off their past
debt. The poorest always have past debt, that&rsquo;s why they are poor.
Negative scorepoints.</p><p>There is also the initial impulse effect of asset revaluations whenever the
interest rate changes sharply, but this is a transient effect. It causes
market disruptions <em>both ways</em> and so creates a perturbation in winners and
losers, but the interest rate story is not what most people think it is, and
the MMT alternative is to just have a permanent zero rate policy.
Private money lenders can be permitted within non-fraudulent reason, to charge
a usury fee, but the MMT alternative is to employ workers so they do not
need to borrow (except if they want to, e.g., buy a house).</p><p>This is a policy I have not heard about in the MMT literature too much,
but Warren Mosler gets close to it, with the Job Guarantee. The idea is that
a basic decent income is government guaranteed, and is <em>sufficient</em> for any
family to live with, inclusively, without stress, and that means it will
always pay the rent, the electricity and the groceries, minimum, plus a bit
to save for a vacation or whatever.</p><p>Why is it not <em>more prominent</em> in the MMT literature? The answer is
because the recovering neoliberal MMT&rsquo;ers still fear the inflation bogeyman.<br><em>Keltonista:</em> &ldquo;Look, we cannot give the poor too many scorepoints, or they might
eat too much and then we will get the horrors of inflaaaashhiooooon.&rdquo;</p><p>Right. Stomach inflation. Not so good.</p><p>If regularly adjusting the JG wage upwards causes a bit of inflation then it
is a good thing. You should never fear or cry about inflation if this is the
cause, it would be reactionary right-wing thinking and framing. You&rsquo;ve just
improved people&rsquo;s lives. <em>So friggin&rsquo; what</em> if the general price level went
upwards?, it is a gauge of the scorekeeping system that the policy to
improve people&rsquo;s lives has just re-gauged.</p><p>Or as Bill Mitchell once put it, what do you prefer? <strong>(A)</strong> the social
pathologies of mass unemployment and wasted human lives, exceeding the costs
of all wars in human history, or <strong>(B)</strong> the scorepoints inflating?</p><p>(I suggest you prefer <em>not</em> to be a proxy mass murderer.)</p><h2 id=the-yield-curve><a class=anchor href=#the-yield-curve title='Anchor for: The Yield Curve.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Yield Curve</h2><p>The conventional (so false) concept is that the yield curve charts the
&ldquo;cost to the government of borrowing&rdquo;. ü§£ A more stupid and regressive
framing is not possible. It is completely backwards.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, there is no cost to the government. The government matures all
bonds by marking down a Treasuries account and marking up a check account.
There is no grandchild transported in from the future, nor any taxpayer
involved. It literally cost $1$¬†minute of a central bank clerk&rsquo;s
labour time.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, the government cannot borrow Its own IOU, at least not if it desires
a non-zero interest rate floor, because the over-night cash rate will head
upwards if the reserve drain (selling bonds) is not offset by a reserve add
(government spending).</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, the government does not <em>need</em> to sell bonds. If the policy is
zero interest rate floor, then the government can always spend and not sell
bonds. Bonds are an interest rate maintenance account, not a funding account,
and as a side-effect benefit <em><strong>only</strong> people who already have money.</em></p><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, if the government desired a positive interest rate (for whatever
reason, but there are no reasons when on a floating exchange rate) then
they might still set the <em>effective</em> interest rate floor to zero but then
tighten regulations on bank credit extension, say by restricting the policy
on collateral regulatory requirements for issuance of those tax credits.
Or increase the credit risk regulations. There are several other policy
options I am sure to increase the &ldquo;own price&rdquo; of the currency (aka. the
interest rate) in the secondary market.</p><p>I personally do not think such policies are necessary. The more stable option
is to have your IOU trade at par, as the base case. Let&rsquo;s try to eliminate
usury, and let&rsquo;s face it, that is what it is when government chooses a
positive interest rate, because although this privileges people who already
have money, its also means chartered banks will increase their interest rate,
since banks (who are not at risk of asset devaluations) are insensitive to the
government&rsquo;s central bank rate, they always operate on a spread rate. (They
are supposed to always be insensitive by regulations, but these are not
well enforced, remember SVB bank!)</p><p>Another way to put this is that a floating exchange rate provides a
government with greater fiscal policy space. It allows the central bank to
set a permanent zero rate without psychological damage of nominal
inflation.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, the zero rate policy is not &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo;. It is money at par.
&ldquo;Cheap money&rdquo; is the <em>higher</em> interest rate, but it is only cheap money for
people who already have money. In fact is is better than cheap, it is free.
Money for nothing except for &ldquo;being rich&rdquo;. Bravo. let&rsquo;s reward you folks
who have sucked up rents from the poor.</p><p>((I can fry my eggs in the sarcasm that drips from my keyboard.))</p><p>This is the thing about interest rates. They are not pure gauge, because they
are asymmetric. For people who have money it is stimulus (albeit highly
regressive, since it is all demand add for no supply add) and they do not need
the money. For the poorest it is crippling, because they <em>need</em> credit, just
to eat. It does not have to be this way.</p><p>The (non-zero) interest rate policy is thus a policy that generates
<em>changes</em> in winners and losers. The positive interest rate acts as a
continual transfer from the poor to the rich, and in <em><em>real terms</em></em> (what
your whole income can purchase).</p><p><strong>Sixth</strong>, there are the other stories about other asset prices effected by
changes in interest rate policy, but I do not need to write about all that,
it is mostly a perturbation for the investment class, and only rich c_unts
exist in that class, and I have no moral obligation to go to bat for them,
they all <em>should</em> know the risks of living in a system with policy set
(and regulations ignored) by worm-brain neoliberal politicians and
central bankers. Governments should just pay pensioners a decent healthy
basic income. Euthanize the &ldquo;investment&rdquo; class and money managers &mdash; they
are all parasitic overhead, a massive drain on the real economy.</p><p>By &ldquo;investment class&rdquo; I really <em>only</em> mean the money managed accounts.
Real investment in real industry is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Senventh</strong>, why does the yield curve invert, then dis-invert. I&rsquo;ve given
you the answer, it is because the central bank votes to set the current
interest rte floor. If they vote it up then new bonds will have higher yield.
That is the whole story.</p><p>Almost. If the central bank thinks there is too much economic activity for
the good of those who like seeing workers suffer from unemployment, then they
think it is appropriate to vote up the interest rate &mdash; because they believe
(falsely in most cases) this cools down the economy. (It doesn&rsquo;t.). It is a
terrible policy response, but that is their thinking. That is why the yield
curve can invert.</p><p>Conversely, if they fear a recession they vote to lower the interest rate,
because they think this lowering of the cost of funds (aka. &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo;)
will help stimulate the economy.
I just pointed out this latter idea (&ldquo;cheap money&rdquo;) is false, it is the
base case for trading the currency at par. It is the most stable. It is
not &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo;. It does not stimulate the economy in most cases. Especially
not if the currency is on a float. In any case, this vote will dis-invert a
yield curve if it was previously inverted. Whether the feared recession ever
happens is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but the backwards policy response is a sick
self-fulfilling prophecy, the lower rates without any fiscal offset, like
reducing taxes, will help <em>cause</em> a recession (drop in sales &mdash; for goods
that people need that can easily be produced &mdash; then the spiral).</p><p>I think I had a few more points to make concerning the Treasury bond market
operations that relate to the Yield Curve story, but hopefully that is
sufficient for now. If you have questions, or question my account, feel free
to write to me. If you donate a few government scorepoints into my bank
account via

apologize if I got something wrong. Oh my goodness, am I selling
Indulgences of some kind?

the reality that nominal inflation is not a financial nor economic risk, it
is a psychological risk. It gets you voted out of office.</p><p>But there is another collateral damage. Because neoliberals do not understand
the monetary system, <em>their policy responses</em> to nominal inflation
adjustments are almost always regressive. This is what hurts the poorest,
not the inflation itself. It is always the inappropriate policy response.
Hence my constant refrain to lefties:</p><blockquote><p>Never fear the inflation bogeyman, it drives you towards regressive
austerity polices. Do not do that! Instead make the appropriate policy
adjustments by stuffing the pockets of the lowest wage workers with your
scorepoints&mldr; but <em>only</em> the lowest waged.</p></blockquote><p>And I would add, do this until you just start to feel like the right-wing
assassins are about to mobilize, but no more than that.</p><p>I myself, if supreme leader, would go the whole hog and risk assassination.
Just to prove a point. The point that honest workers getting paid more
are <em>never the problem</em> &mdash; unless they are the backwards thinking miscreants
who turn fascist because someone even more Cretinous told them they
should desire gold but cannot convert their scorepoints into certificates
for gold bullion that is kept under the ground. (Is it a transgression to
use the word Cretin these days? I cannot keep up with these things.)</p><p><strong>Rich c_nts:</strong> I know I should not cuss, you cannot help yourselves. But you
understand why I do pity you so much: you do have a moral choice, unlike a
starving household. You can always choose to spend all your income. A low
wage worker cannot, they always spend all their income (which is a good
thing for everyone else) but not because they choose.</p><p><strong>Preppers:</strong> When you build your bunker for the end of the world scenario, is
gold really going to be your main commodity of choice to steal? What do you
think the farmer who bakes your bread is going to ask in exchange for her
bread? She is not going to waste burning energy carrying around
<font style="color: #ffd755;">gold bars</font>.</p><h3 id=apologies><a class=anchor href=#apologies title='Anchor for: Apologies.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Apologies</h3><p>Sorry again for no mathematics to back up the stories, and no
