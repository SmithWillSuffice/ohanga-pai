well-credentialled elites 90% of the time, it&rsquo;s that 10% of the time when
<em>we</em> are on the right side of justice when <em>you</em> should listen to us and
yet you won&rsquo;t.</p><p>Yanis Varoufakis is one of these elites, with an inflated ego, who thinks
he is right and the dirtbag MMT likes of us are &mdash; not even wrong &mdash; we&rsquo;re
just never listened to, that completely ignored class. More untouchable
than the untouchables.,Dalit without Dalit.</p><p>Guys. Bluesky gals, Mastodon guys. Yanis is no saviour.</p><p>He is most especially wrong when he says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little fascist in
all of us.&rdquo;</p><p>Who the hell is he to speak for us?</p><p>Mind your own mental qualia I would say.</p><hr><p>Superhero comic fandom is the flip side of fearing the Big Daddy.</p><p>When I was twelve years old I knew Superman was a fascist. But I liked
it. Kids are conditioned to like the Ayn Rand fash, after all, when you are
a child you are puny and helpless and need s big strong Daddy.</p><p>But you are capable of spiritual growth and so can grow the heck out of
that phase.</p><p>One reason why The Batman is so revered is because he is more honest.
Superman is the fascist who is respectable enough to take home with
you to meet your parents. Batman is the honest one whom you want to
stay the hell away from as he saves your ꗇꕷꕷ from the fictional
Inflaton Boogeyman.</p><p>Batman is the more respectable in the end then. But that&rsquo;s the wrong word.
What is the appropriate word? Comprehensible. It is comprehensible why so
many people worship The Batman, all good people have an innate appreciation
and reverence for honesty.
This does not excuse their fascism.
You can see this in today&rsquo;s Clown King phenome, DJT.</p><p>To turn it all around we need to wake people up to their inner and
collective Batman. We are all defenders of justice when we act together,
not as vigilantes.</p><p>But Great Men is the wrong metaphor. People are great. Men are idiots.</p><p>Even some arrogant 𝕒𝕗 individuals have acknowledged this, my favourite of whom was Isaac Newton: &ldquo;If I have further than others it is only because I stand on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo;</p><p>Even that was a bit off-colour, since by the implied logic there never
were individual giants in the history of science. By like Einstein (minus
the misogyny). Being a Giant without Being a Giant.</p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO:
* Tax credit &gt; UBI,
</code></pre><p>Have a think too.</p><p>No, I mean have a <em>proper</em> think.</p><p>Do you honestly regard Andrew Yang, Peter Theil and Guy Standing as better
macroeconomic justice thinkers than yours truly the Dirtbag MMT&rsquo;er?
(No, I mean <em>apart</em> from the fact that I just parrot Mosler like an MMT LLM.)</p><p>Right? So maybe take heed of what I write, not what they spew.</p><p>I might be wrong on occasion about quantum gravity, but I am not wrong
about justice for the working class. Do not take your &ldquo;eye off the prize&rdquo;
either. The prize is to eliminate economic class and inequality. Not to
alleviate material poverty. The former guarantees the latter, not the other
way around.</p><p>All attempts at state welfare have always failed. But do you
ubi sᵢmᵖlₑtᵒn iⁿnₒcᵉnₜ 𝖈𝖚𝖓𝖙𝖘 understand why?</p><p>Liberal state welfare is what we do not want. What we want is social welfare.
What does that mean? It means we want control over our own lives so that we
never need to appeal to state welfare. The only welfare worth having comes
from our own community. The legitimate State apparatus should exist (in modern
times, I acknowledge all the past history is sewage under the bridge) in order
to facilitate community welfare. That means basic stuff, like helping and
serving each other. This is anti-servitude.</p><p>If you just have no idea what I am talking about, and are suffering a brain
hemorrhage from cognitive dissonance, then I do apologize, but no one ever
said learning was easy.</p><p>People who think &ldquo;the other way around&rdquo; <em>j&rsquo;accuse</em> as guilty of money
fetish. It is never about &ldquo;the money&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the whole point of MMT
education and awareness &mdash; to completely take &ldquo;the money&rdquo; off the table.
We mean, of course, take all <em>concern</em> about &ldquo;the money&rdquo; and the insatiable
desire for &ldquo;savings&rdquo; off your minds. The
focus is on meaningful lives and work. To eliminate 🅱𝘂𝓵🅛🅂𝖍𝗶🅃 work, and to
enhance public services. A UBI accomplishes <em>none</em> of this, and actively
works against the goodness, it focuses your attention on the money, exactly
the opposite of what we want to achieve (here on the dirtbag left).</p><p>We are always <em>today</em> living in material poverty. No one ever has as much
as they desire. To move to a better tomorrow all you need to do is reduce your
material desires and what <em>we all</em> need to do is fight for government policy
that eliminates extreme inequality &mdash; the good Bell Curve (anti-Pareto
distributions). This does not mean living in starvation nor like a monk,
nor in want of basic Maslow needs and all that. It means also first (or
eventually, last, whatever order you can manage I guess) becoming
spiritually rich. Knowing the difference between silly desires and basic
needs &mdash; like some ’puter power to research quantum gravity.🤣</p><p>If you think I am contradicting myself in some way, I politely suggest you
are missing something. But I literally (not just literally, but <em>literally</em>)
have no time and energy to write a book on all this trying to mansplain myself
any better. I&rsquo;d like to be able to write in mild-mannered sweet words and
powerful righteous principles and lofty language, but my time is too short.
Besides, others have already done so, in with far higher spiritual authority
than I will ever muster, but modesty (or something &mldr; it&rsquo;s more like proper
pedagogy I believe) forbids me from naming those sources. It&rsquo;s better you
discover for yourself, since the Name is really unimportant. I&rsquo;ll just say
if you sincerely ask, then I&rsquo;d be ok with sharing my views. Some things are
just too important to reduce to propaganda and proselytizing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s incumbent on you to figure some things out for yourself, I
can only point you in a decent direction, towards justice, and away from
greed and selfishness and false &ldquo;freedoms.&rdquo;</p><p>Can I just suggest (maybe unhelpfully for you!?), if you are working in a
job you hate, then quit, or
organize your comrades to make the workplace a nicer place to work. Why the
ꖾꗍꝆꝆ are you giving <em>that</em> boss${}^\dagger$ your labour time? Or are you that ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ
that <em>you</em> think you the mighty Han Solo or Ayn Randdotcom can make a
difference to the world only when you&rsquo;ve got a handsome income and acquire
sufficient savings of government scorepoints? Welcome to the Mind of Gates,
Welcome to the Machine.</p><p>Sorry. Did I get too dirtbag for you?</p><p>${}^\dagger$I mean <em>aside</em> from the fact you need the government&rsquo;s
scorepoints.</p><h2 id=legislation-is-not-a-dirty-word><a class=anchor href=#legislation-is-not-a-dirty-word title='Anchor for: &lsquo;Legislation&rsquo; is not a Dirty Word.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>&lsquo;Legislation&rsquo; is not a Dirty Word</h2><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO
