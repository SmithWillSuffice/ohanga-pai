chapter
I wrote last week &ldquo;<a href=/ohanga-pai/questions/20_peripherynations>MMT and the Periphery</a>
&rdquo; commentary,
I thought it might be useful to critically review the defences of MMT, from a hard
core MMT perspective (that&rsquo;s me). At least I think I am hard core.
As in what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBPiMHkgx8" target=_blank>Buttercup said to Bubbles</a>
.
What I&rsquo;d mean by that is taking a view that the Mosler <em>MMT Base Case</em> is in fact
realizable in the real world.</p><p>But what does <em>that</em> mean?</p><p>It means a strong enough government (meaning it has the backing of a majority of the
population in real terms, not mere votes) can instruct their central bank to
institute ZIRP, and run a decent Job Guarantee program. We should throw in various
banking reforms to &ldquo;make banking boring again&rdquo; &mdash; the <a href=https://moslereconomics.com/2009/09/16/proposals-for-the-banking-system-treasury-fed-and-fdic-draft/ target=_blank>Mosler narrow banking proposals</a>
. In addition the MMT Base Case for analysis considers a non-convertible
fiat currency driven by tax liabilities and on a floating exchange rate.
But otherwise MMT is not prescriptive for all sorts of other hot button culture war
issues. The MMT Base Case admits whatever the culture war presently gives you.</p><p>This is no failing of MMT. If you get nasty culture that&rsquo;s on you and your people.
MMT would probably run very well if complemented by a decent society, say in Finland,
New Zealand or Costa Rica. Dick Cheney shows you how <em>aspects of</em> (not the whole of)
MMT works in a messed up culture.</p><p>That last statement is suss of course, since the USA is already &ldquo;doing MMT&rdquo; and have
been doing so for a long while. What we mean here is running the Base Case for
analysis, which the neocon Bush Administration warmongers certainly did not &ldquo;do&rdquo;. Nor
did anyone from George Washington to Joe Biden.</p><p>New Zealand does of course run an MMT system. The trouble is our politicians do not know
it, so they abuse it &mdash; they tolerate involuntary unemployment because they (falsely)
think this fights inflation. Part of &ldquo;a decent society&rdquo; should thus by rights include
well-informed and morally conscious politicians, this New Zealand does not completely
have just yet.</p><h2 id=why-mmart><a class=anchor href=#why-mmart title='Anchor for: Why &ldquo;MMArt&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Why &ldquo;MMArt&rdquo;?</h2><p>Most orthodox economics critiques of MMT construct a straw man, but not in a good way.
A <strong><em>good</em></strong> straw man might be Mosler&rsquo;s MMT Base Case, since no country on Earth is
operating this base case, so you have to imagine it &mdash;a straw country. That&rsquo;s a
proper quasi-straw man, but then of course the critique is not a straw man fallacy.
It&rsquo;d be a theoretical analysis, and could be good and proper. But this is not what we
find in the academic journals.</p><p>In the academic journals, and newspapers, we find utterly fanciful fabrications of
something bizarre, that people think is &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; but which is no such thing. These give
rise to proper straw man fallacies. It can look pretty to an orthodox economist of
course. It is MMArt. You could insert an &ldquo;F&rdquo; there before the &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;d be the
mainstream economists emitting the vapours.</p><h2 id=muscle-flexing-score><a class=anchor href=#muscle-flexing-score title='Anchor for: Muscle Flexing Score.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Muscle Flexing Score</h2><p>I am going to start with a perhaps less well read defence of MMT from
<a href=https://doi.org/10.4337/ejeep.2022.0092 target=_blank>Eric Tymoigne (2022)</a>
, which I think is
good because it is less well known, but also because it takes on a particularly dull
yet weirdly fanatical anti-MMT critique by
<a href=https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/ejeep/aop/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092.xml#ref-021 target=_blank>Drumetz and Pfister (2021)</a>
, and
the fanaticism in the latter makes it relatively less dull, than say a moderately
&ldquo;good faith&rdquo; critique by someone like Tom Palley, Steve Keen or Paul Krugman.</p><p>Krugman, almost on public record, understands and agrees with MMT, he&rsquo;s debated Steve
Keen, and has talked to Stephanie Kelton. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the balls to admit it,
which I&rsquo;m not so sure is not more despicable than an honest neoclassical? C&rsquo;mon
Kruggers, you can do better.</p><p>OK, so this is an exercise. We&rsquo;re going to see if Eric Tymoigne mounted a good
defence, and see what he could&rsquo;ve written better. Before I even begin reading it
(this is an <em>extra</em> exercise I like to do, to predict my own response ahead of time,
only possible in a blog, you cannot get this sort of stuff published in academic
journals) I am going to guess what my reaction will be.</p><p>I am guessing Tymoigne will do a fair job, accurate, but missing some critical
spiritual principles and moral analysis. MMT needs defence not <em>only</em> because it is
accurate, but because this matters, it matters a helluva lot.</p><p>So we&rsquo;ll give him strength, style, streetsmart, and Blackadder points.
I&rsquo;m predicting 60 to 70 out of 100 points. Maybe 80, since Tymoigne is no slouch and
seems to be a bit of a progressive &ldquo;leftie&rdquo;. Progressive lefties tend to be overly
geeky and analytical, lacking humour, and too willing to display &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;
credentials to the detriment, or maybe just the de-emphasis, of the more important
moral and ethical principles. I do not really know why this is so (I am myself
probably a progressive leftie, so atypical) but it is what it is, perhaps some blind
subconscious allegiance to Marxism (a supposed &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; philosophy devoid of
spirituality when taken irreligiously, which is to say
<a href=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html target=_blank>religiously</a>
).</p><p>((Of course, I&rsquo;ve written on this elsewhere: Marx was certainly a very spiritual guy,
since his heart was obviously deeply concerned for the plight of the poor and the
needless suffering of the working class. (Needless, that is, if you&rsquo;re not a rentier
capitalist.) He was also arrogant (anti-spiritual quality) and pompous, and lacked
a scientific investigation of monetary economics and real production. Just sayin&rsquo;.))</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get on with the Marxometer muscle flexing scoring then&mldr;</p><h3 id=marxometer-readings><a class=anchor href=#marxometer-readings title='Anchor for: Marxometer Readings.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Marxometer Readings</h3><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO: only just getting started.

The Moslerometer would normally do, but
suffers from calibration uncertainty owing to logarithmic scale jumps when encountering
neoclassicals, and I have not learned to do the stochastic equilibrium calibration
corrections. The ThomasFrankerator however is a very simple device and soft enough it
can also be used to slap orthodox economists after use, which is a handy dual purpose.
The Moslerometer is more sensitive and requires recuperation in the Caribbean tropics
after use, so I&rsquo;m going with the ThomasFrankerator.</p><h2 id=blackadder-points><a class=anchor href=#blackadder-points title='Anchor for: Blackadder Points.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Blackadder Points</h2><p>The easiest thing to do here in-person is to pull out the Python Holy Grail and see
if its waters sizzle Tymoigne&rsquo;s skin. But lacking Tymoigne in person, we resort to the
Chaplinograph, which produces a silent black & white test. No ambiguity here.</p><h2 id=further-reading><a class=anchor href=#further-reading title='Anchor for: Further Reading.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Further Reading</h2><p>Since this is a review of a critical inquiry I&rsquo;m not going into further depth. But
this does naturally lead to the next article I am writing on the <em>Hard Problem of
MMT</em> &mdash; which is getting MMT awareness into practice, even as almost all major
governments run an MMT system (the eurozone being the odd duck, but it could still
function according to the MMT Base Case by adopting the Federal union model of the
USA).</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be writing this next article over in the <a href=/ohanga-pai/questions>Questions</a>
section <a href=/ohanga-pai/questions/21_powerplays>here in “Punked Plutocrat Power Plays”</a>
. This is
the start of probably the most important extension of Ōhanga Pai beyond core MMT, maybe
even more important than the software.</p><p><a href=../19_europonzi>Next chapter (Euroland Is Ponzi)</a><br><a href=../17_machinescandothework>Previous chapter (Machines Can't Think to Work)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
