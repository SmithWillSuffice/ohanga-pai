of fascism spilling out. It will pass. The Ai bubble? Hardly. You cannot stop
a nerd from believing a program emitting strings that read well are conscious.
But unlike radical reich-wing political movements, the computer nerds are not
causing any harm. It is the right-wing NerdReich techno-fascists who control
the computer tech who can cause harm.</p><p>Please do not mistake this for a US 2nd Amendments thing, ‚ÄúGuns do not
kill, people do.‚Äù &mdash; It‚Äôs not the same by any stretch. An LLM or CNN/rNN is
not designed to kill. That makes all the difference. (Jason Bourne can kill
with a roll of newspaper or a sharpie pen, so let‚Äôs ban those.)</p><p>I was not so sure The Murph has the correct analysis of the DJT era.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quite what you he makes out. In my view, I suspect no one really cares
about DJT &ldquo;delivering results,&rdquo; except a few saps in the fake-populist petty
bourgeoisie.</p><p>A deeper analysis has to look at things like Citizens United,
and the deeply unholy &lsquo;deep state&rsquo; alliances between the (anti)Christian far
right and Zionists, and Oligarchs, the modern unholy Trinity. In their
worldview DJT has delivered results, no more-so evident than SCOTUS. It&rsquo;s good
for them DJT can be a fall-guy. DJT himself doesn&rsquo;t seem to care (he&rsquo;s not
even a turd blossom), provided he gets a few more million US tax credits in
his bank account. After DJT there&rsquo;ll just be another reactionary fake populist.
It&rsquo;s a lot like the crypto bubble. It can be sustained in perpetuity because
those really pulling the strings are isolated and inoculated from the
political and economic fall-out. Meaning if we actually want neocon
reich-wing politics to crash out, we have to actively work hard to make it
happen, and seeing the grave of DJT is not the way.</p><p>Genuine honest, sincere Christians would never vote for DJT, and would never
use him for their Machiavellian purposes, and would never seek to repeal
Roe vs Wade in the first place (the <em>casus belli</em> for Citizens United).
(See the documentary, <em>The Dark Money Game</em> to witness how a sincere
Christian turned against DJT and CU, after initially swallowing the
reich-wing koolaid of the prosperity gospel.)</p><p>Richard also mentions something about &ldquo;ùñïùñÜùñéùñì&rdquo; being involved in these
&lsquo;collapses&rsquo;. I thought Jeff Rich at <em>The Burning Archive</em> had a better take
on &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; youtubers. (They&rsquo;re real influencers, fake educators).</p><p>I wrote to Murph:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNTnh32nvGQ&t=360s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH" target=_blank>@6:00</a>
no pain needs to be involved. At least nto for good people. The government is
not beholden to &ldquo;financial markets&rdquo;. Nor are farmers, carpenters, and other
crafts-people and artisans. The financial markets are dependent on government.
So you had that backwards. If financial markets collapse that&rsquo;s a very good
thing, it frees up otherwise parasitic labour for other purposes. Those
Wall St Quants can no be hired by the State to teach the history of their now
eliminated and predatory former profession to kids in schools. Lest the kids
ever forget.</p></blockquote><h2 id=comments-on-the-aicrypto-bubble><a class=anchor href=#comments-on-the-aicrypto-bubble title='Anchor for: Comments on the Ai/Crypto Bubble.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Comments on the Ai/Crypto Bubble</h2><p>The crypto bubble cannot burst of its own accord. It is a new type of suport
for Black Markets. The way to get rid of it all is to legalize the
black market goods.
But who the devil wants to legalize assassins for Hire and assault weapons
trde?</p><p>Some things are illegal for a reason.</p><p>I can understand regulating recreational drugs. It makes a more peaceful
subculture, young rich kids no longer supporting South American and
Asian murder catels. But some drugs should not be legal.</p><p>In a liberal demcoracy or social democracy, I think we have to tolerate
the propensity of some people to do Íï∑Íñ°ÍñπÍòùÍïØÍïí things. We do not have to
encourage and endorse them! If a King or Emperor tries too regulate all
behaviour under the pretense of &ldquo;protecting the common good&rdquo; then I call
that a spiritual death. It&rsquo;s not living. You are not truly alive if you have
no capacity for trungin Íï∑Íñ°ÍñπÍòùÍïØÍïí thoughts into Íï∑Íñ°ÍñπÍòùÍïØÍïí deeds. The whole point
of spiritual growth is to learn to have betetr thoughts, as well as better
deeds, the latter will follwo from the former. If you have no such capacity
your are either dead, or a robot.</p><p>In related reporting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2s8I6yBrxE" target=_blank>The Primeagen</a>
(hardly a raging legftie) had a monologue on the
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192 target=_blank>study shwoing a small number of bad samples can poison LLM‚Äôs of any size</a>
.</p><p>Sure. If the thing was conscious can you imagine you can poison it with a
little bit of FoxNews? [Rhetorical question yo.]</p><p>Hey, I&rsquo;m not gong to make any Oracle pronouncements. The Murph could be
correct than one of these tech bubbles could ùêúùì∏ùñëùìµùì™ùï°ùî∞ùìÆ soon. I&rsquo;m just saying I
do not see why. There are supports direct from government that prop such
scams up. In the case of Ai it&rsquo;s failure to enforce anti-trust, failure to
protect consumers, and direct government fiscal support for the tech-bro
oligarchs. For Crypto it is austerity, for want of a better catch-all.
Government austerity is what drives demand for ponzi &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; schemes.
But also the existence of black markets too, and the imposed &ldquo;need&rdquo; for
tax havens or in the case of Crypto just escape from tax altogether.</p><p>It is a stretch to claim (needless) government fiscal austerity promotes
Crypto, it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated. But I&rsquo;ll stick to that as a minor
claim. It&rsquo;s not <em>all</em> wrong.</p><p>((For MMT n00bs: &ldquo;fiscal austerity&rdquo; can be simplified to taxing more than
they spend. KÃêÃàIÃêÃàSÃêÃàSÃêÃà. Although that KÃêÃàIÃêÃàSÃêÃàSÃêÃà is a bit gross, since it doesn&rsquo;t
distinguish military Keynesianism from decent things like full employment,
via expanded universal public services and a Job Guarantee. So one should
also both KÃêÃàIÃêÃàSÃêÃàSÃêÃà and TÕõEÕõLÕõLÕõ.))</p><p>If government taxed real estate instead of incomes, especially taxing to the
high hilt non-owner occupied housing, then a lot of tax evasion disappears.
And all the other typical MMT informed fiscal policies, and eliminating of
monetarist policy, goes a long way to deep sixing the parasitic finance
sector, and along with it probably a lot of Crypto.</p><p>In any case, who cares? Not I for one. Crypto is a kind of cordoned off other
world. It recycles winners and losers, like a Casino. You can avoid most of
the rot by just not gambling. Do not participate!</p><p>Same for drug wars. Just don&rsquo;t take drugs, then the drug lords go away.
I know, easier said than done in some cases Too many Banksie <em>The Culture</em>
wannabe acid communists. But for Crypto, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to not participate.</p><p>I admit there is some leakage of crud into ordinary people&rsquo;s lives, since a
bit of continued government austerity can be immorally justified by
neoliberals appealing to crypto, although goodness knows why epopel fall for
it still. You know what I mean &mdash; <strong>KingNeolib:</strong> <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re deregulating it all, so people have the freedom to get rich quick and all that&mldr; so just say &rsquo;thank you&rsquo; you miserable plebs.&rdquo;</em></p><p>((Lord forgive them, they might not know what they do.))</p><h2 id=comments-on-the-neolib-bubble><a class=anchor href=#comments-on-the-neolib-bubble title='Anchor for: Comments on the Neolib Bubble.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Comments on the Neolib Bubble</h2><p>Onyl really had minor objections to some language framing. But IU think they
are important.</p><p>The Murph argues that a fair economy will balance or focus on Moral Purpose,
not &ldquo;balance the books&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>This is a beautiful monologue. Everything good I can endorse. Please run
for PM? ü§£ However @7:00 it&rsquo;s not about &ldquo;balance the books&rdquo; ‚Äî that&rsquo;s false
rhetoric and false framing, so do not frame it that way. The books
are <em>always in balance</em> or some accountant made a mistake and has to fix it.
We already run MMT systems. The correct reich-wing framing is that they
want <em>fiscal flows</em> in‚Äìout of Gov to net to zero. Totally different to
&ldquo;balancing the books&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>He mentioend that we can design an economy that gorws wages, not just empty
statements about growing GDP". I wrote,</p><blockquote><p>@5:14 no, no no, ‚Äî <em>no</em> to &ldquo;growing wages&rdquo;. Yes to &ldquo;growing <strong>real</strong> wages&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s not about the nominal wage nor inflation (a fake boogeyman) it is about
the real goods your whole income can purchase, not what $1 can purchase.
A follow-up:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Inflation is neither good nor bad, it all depends on how it was generated.
It can be good by design ‚Äî increase the floor wage with a Job Guarantee
continual upwards adjustment. This achieves what all soi dissant lefties say
they want ‚Äî a wealth tax on hoarded tax credits. Are they prepared to back
it for real then, even if it is &ldquo;too easy&rdquo; being by de facto ? Or are they
all going to become right wing Thatcherites again and cry about inflation?
(Again, since as they do by spewing &ldquo;me tax dollars paid for it&mldr;&rdquo;
Thatcherite nonsense.)</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s again a vital distinction. Who the hell cares if their wage is rising if
the price is rising faster? Who the heck cares if their wage is falling if
prices are falling faster?</p><p>Yeah, I recognize people care! They&rsquo;re all fools. What can I tell ya&rsquo;?
I&rsquo;m just here to promote true knowledge, nto false psychology. But my all
means, if you think it serves justice then continue to spew lies.</p><p>In my corner of spiritual geekdom, a lie is never going to lead to justice.
There is some sort of metaphirical principle behind that, no dout wrapped up
in why and how we are conscious snetient Beings. But that&rsquo;s a whole different
blog site. <strong>SPiritual econmics</strong> is what Richard Murphy preaches, and it is
good. All it means is promoting and acting for love, compoasison, kindness,
honesty, wisdom and justice&mldr; and yes, mercy even for the &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; (a
relative concept, glass houses, stones, and all that).</p><p>Richard is one of the few MMT&rsquo;ers I know who promote spiritual economics,
and that&rsquo;s what ≈åhanga Pai was suppsoed to be about. You have to however take
some liguistic turpentine, isopropal, waterjet, &c., to cleanse my blogs of
the cusswords to reveal the gems. Richard is nmore striahgt-up and boring,
the Monty Chartered Accountant of Dirtbag spiritual MMT.
