<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC2oLB4Nsw8" target=_blank>DemystifySci podcast here</a>
.
Awesome.</p><p>Gotta celebrate podcasters prepared to upload over two hours with a guy like
Warren talking about monetary operations 101!</p><p>A couple of issues raised by the hostess, Dr Anastasia Bendebury, piqued my
interest, since Warren was not able to fill in all the gaps.</p><h2 id=stock-market><a class=anchor href=#stock-market title='Anchor for: Stock Market.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Stock Market</h2><p>The issue is Warren (and most MMT&rsquo;ers I suspect) favour ZIRP = zero interest
rate Central Bank/Tsy policy. Which means any Tsy bonds issued provide zero
interest, and serve the purpose only to maintain smooth reserve account
operations. This is not strictly necessary, since the Act could be changed to
permit member banks overdrafts. But to avoid a lot of legal Bill debate and
drafting, the Tsy could just issue 3-month bills and repo operations so
banks can clear payments without overdrafts. (Cannot do a reserve drain
without a reserve add, stuff.)</p><p>What&rsquo;s the issue again? Aside from getting Parliament to approve this
elimination of the bond market (a complete waste of human lives) the concern
raised by Anastasia was, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t money just plough into stocks?&rdquo;.</p><p>A response (implicit I think by Mosler) was, &ldquo;And&mldr;?&rdquo;</p><p>Warren had already addressed the deeper problem of why there are such
powerful savings incentives, which tend to the Paradox of Thrift, and force
governments to run deficits, large deficits. If people really do not like
large numbers, for whatever reason (numerophobia?), they (governments) should
stop creating massive artificial savings incentives. Case closed.</p><p>However, perhaps Anastasia meant that it could be a concern that people put
money into riskier assets? But again&mldr; &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</p><p>What Warren did not have the time to mention was his proposal for eliminating
the stock market casino.</p><p>The idea is to cap stock prices at say $20. If a firm needs more capital
they can issue more shares. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>But it raised a question I emailed Warren: what about implementing the
proposal: (1) eliminate the bond market, (2) implement the stock market
stability proposal. It&rsquo;s the same story for monopolists: you have options,
you can set price and let quantity float, or fix quantity if you are
prepared for the price to be volatile. I&rsquo;ll make a note here if Warren offers
a comment.</p><p>My guess is a minimal disruption could be simply on Day=1 the SEC dictates
no stock can go above $20. All existing stock holders get new shares to
match their current portfolio valuation.</p><p>My feeling is massive political backlash from the bond market bros and stock
market phreaks, but again&mldr; so what? Let them cry. No one with stocks will
lose any investments. Their methodology for analyzing the market will have
to change, but &mldr; so what? They&rsquo;re not all dummies, most can drive
a spreadsheet.</p><h2 id=payroll-tax-elimination><a class=anchor href=#payroll-tax-elimination title='Anchor for: Payroll Tax Elimination.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Payroll Tax Elimination</h2><p>This was the biggie. I think it is the grand daddy of all MMT ideas, besides
the public sector employment proposals (+ Job Guarantee). Although even Warren
seemed vague on the actual GDP fractions that we waste on useless human
activity, but let&rsquo;s suppose a ballpark is:</p><ol><li><strong>Tax compliance costs:</strong> around 10% of GDP on bullsh1t jobs.</li><li><strong>Payroll Tax:</strong> about 15% of GDP on bullsh1t tax revenue (and tax avoidance accountants and all the rest).</li><li><strong>Bond markets:</strong> around 3% of GDP on bullsh1t trading.</li><li><strong>Stock market gambling:</strong> about 5% of GDP on bullsh1t investment gambling.</li><li><strong>Financial sector:</strong> about 5% of humans are calling themselves financiers
about are not financing anything, they are parasites, rentiers. we do not need
99% of the so-called finance sector.</li></ol><p>((When I write &ldquo;suppose a ballpark&rdquo; you are correct in noting that&rsquo;s a
huge fudge and I have no idea what the percentages are to within $\pm 5%$
or even worse! My point today is more qualitative, and yet I recognize it must
rest on some large percentages here.))</p><p>I mean&mldr; hellsbells, you can see how very rough estimates might even get to
above 100% of GDP!!!! That&rsquo;d just mean your estimates were way off, but in
any case, it suggests we are losing an incredible tragic amount of human
time and energy on pointless activity. Meaning <em>pointless</em> in the MMT
context. I&rsquo;ve no beef with people who see a need to trade bonds or invest
in stocks because existing government institutional structure practically
forces them to save. We are talking here about what <em>could be</em> and
what <em>should be.</em> And through an MMT Lens.</p><h3 id=elimination-proposals><a class=anchor href=#elimination-proposals title='Anchor for: Elimination Proposals.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Elimination Proposals</h3><p>I am concerned here about the political process. MMT&rsquo;ers need to give advice
to policy makers and governments to make the transitions run smoothly.
But some of them can be sharp.</p><p>I&rsquo;m no expert on the <em>elimination of bullsh1t</em> strategies, but for starters
I&rsquo;d guess:</p><ol><li><strong>Tax compliance costs:</strong> just implement robust property taxes, no change to
other taxes, just set the other non-pigovian (and reverse pigovian) tax rates
to zero. Implement the Job Guarantee, so the newly unemployed have oodles of
decent dignified things to do for income, while transitioning back to non-bs
jobs.</li><li><strong>Payroll and GST Tax:</strong> Just set these to zero. No need to go through
the political hassle of changing the tax statutes. Since no GST and Payroll
tax forms need to be submitted now, that GST hassle and family finance hassle
disappears, freeing up a substantial amount of the government deficit for
spending. Probably also, along with the other tax compliance eliminations,
frees up around 20% of the workforce to do better things. (I think requires
the JG again, because of all the tax attorneys and accountant put out of
work.)</li><li><strong>Bond markets:</strong> government moves to only issuance of ZIRP 3-month
Tsy bills for payments clearing operations to run smoothly.</li><li><strong>Stock market gambling:</strong> the Mosler proposal.</li><li><strong>Financial sector:</strong> several proposals, but to my mind the big one would
be to eliminate tax advantaged savings schemes, and increase the pension to a
decent living income, and scrap national superannuation (total waste of
human time).</li></ol><p>With these simple policies (not saying they&rsquo;d be easy political battles to
win) we get something like 30 to 40% of GDP going towards raising standards
of living and reducing work hours, with no economic downside. That&rsquo;s massive!
Just think about it!</p><h2 id=inflation-from-oil-price><a class=anchor href=#inflation-from-oil-price title='Anchor for: Inflation from Oil Price.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Inflation from Oil Price</h2><p>The other big issue raised by Anastasia was the fear over the &ldquo;collapse of
the dollar&rdquo; due to a sequence of implausible events. Warren asked her, &ldquo;Give
me an example where that&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; which although a bit flippant, is the
best response.</p><p>We would not get a collapse of the dollar provided the government continues
to enforce tax liabilities. Period.</p><p>Everything else (for the government deficit issuance) is a policy choice. Do
we want to spend significant fractions of GDP in building bridges or on
blowing up bridges?</p><p>Could there be inflationary episodes from those foreign monopolies setting
price? Sure. No political process absent invading those foreigners or CIA
assassinations, can prevent them. But we do not need the assassinations
or invasions. Only the MMT Lens explains why not!</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../71_milieu_of_milei>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../73_m_again_but_aged_well>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../71_milieu_of_milei>Milieu of Milei</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../73_m_again_but_aged_well>M Again, de-Aged</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
