Unlike Dr Bill Mitchell, I
can afford to be short and sweet.</p><p>The New Zealand Tory government (National + ACT party) have macroeconomics
completely backwards. Not just roughly. Completely. The &ldquo;finance&rdquo; Minister
Nicola Willis went on official record the other day in proclaiming the NZ
Government is like a household. Or, the Government Budget is Like a
Household Budget".</p><p>Every MMT&rsquo;er around knows this is utterly insane, and even a few post-Keynesian
dimly know. I did my best on non-X social media to denounce Willis. But I&rsquo;ll do
it again. However, because post-Keynesians are contributing to the myths, still,
we have to focus on them, because they should know better. So should heterodox
folks like Brian Romanchuk (he&rsquo;s a bit suss on these issues, I will try to
explain in a minute&rsquo;).</p><p>And it is not that the previous Labour government was much better, their
leader Chris Hipkins was saying the same as Willis in different words. But
class warfare is class warfare no matter whose mouth sounds the sweetest
austerity.</p><h2 id=the-neoliberal-narrative><a class=anchor href=#the-neoliberal-narrative title='Anchor for: The neoliberal narrative.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The neoliberal narrative</h2><p>THe &ldquo;household budget&rdquo;. Completely moronic when you are the monopoly
currency issuer."</p><h3 id=how-to-counter-the-narrative><a class=anchor href=#how-to-counter-the-narrative title='Anchor for: How to counter the narrative.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How to counter the narrative</h3><p>The hard honest answer is we have to educate others. Education is
innoculation against ignorance. But I have some tips, you should write to
me if you find they work:</p><ol><li>Focus on the basics: there is no need for our government to tax in order
to ne able to spend. They impose tax liabilities to drive demand for the
currency &mdash; willing takers &mdash; not to &ldquo;&ldquo;get the money&rdquo;.</li><li>Neither do Treasury bonds &ldquo;finance the government. No one can buy a bond
until the government issues the tax credits.</li><li>Nor do Treasury bonds &ldquo;balance the budget&rdquo;. The books are always in
balance. The issuance of bonds is (on a floating exchange rate) nothing but
<em>basic income for people who already have money in proportion to how much money they already have</em>.</li></ol><p>So why are we even talking about bonds? Why are we talking about
&ldquo;balancing the budget&rdquo;? It is all irrelevant talk.</p><p>The purpose of public macroeconomic policy should be full meaningful
employment of all resources. If the private sector is not employing existing
resources (people, for the most part) the government always can hire them,
without causing any price pressure &mdash; because by definition to private sector
bid for unemployed labour is zero.</p><p><strong>Remark 1:</strong> Can a full employment policy cause one-off upwards price adjustments?</p><p>Sure. But that is a policy choice. It does not follow by any economics law
known to man or woman. Also, a one-off upwards adjustment in prices is not
inflation. So stop talking as if it was!</p><p><strong>Remark 2:</strong> can wasteful spending by a government cause a real rate of
inflation (devaluation of wages relative to goods, or an increase in the
real inflation rate (how much stuff your entire income can buy))? Yes, sure
it can. But that is again a policy choice. Unleashing MMT awareness upon
feckless politicians is highly unlikely to cause such wastefulness. They
are austerity hawks. It is hard enough to get government to spend already.</p><p>If you think MMT awareness infused into their brains will make them suddenly
overnight want to spend <em>wastefully</em> then I think you need to go see a
psychiatrist.</p><p>Yeah, they might be more prone to spending on junkets and cronyism, but
that is hard in New Zealand, we are pretty open. You vote those bastards
out of office pretty smart.</p><p>If you also worry about the <em>balance of payments</em>, that&rsquo;s just another
sickness akin to invoking the disgusting &ldquo;household budget&rdquo; dis-analogy.
Any holdings of NZD that foreigners have cannot purchase them things that
are not for sale. If you worry our politicians are for sale, that&rsquo;s not a
problem because of foreign holdings of NZD, it is a problem due to any
hoards of any currency, since anyone can swap USD, euro, Yen, or Ruble,
for NZD at a Forex desk.</p><h2 id=the-proper-hammer><a class=anchor href=#the-proper-hammer title='Anchor for: The Proper Hammer.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Proper Hammer</h2><p>I loath Nietzsche. (Heck, he did have syphilis and was insane. In the real
world a person&rsquo;s character counts for something, not just their analytical
concepts. If someone has a poor character you trust less their ideals.
Sorry theorypleeb and you other Lacanians. That&rsquo;s just reality.)</p><p>I also do not like Vladimir Lenin. You can cry to me as loud as you like
about how masterful he was as an organizer, but without a mass of ordinary
peasant people and bourgeoisie supporters, who believed in a decent vision for
Russia, he was nothing. If you truly think Lenin was a great man, you are
closer to being an Ayn Rand acolyte than a working class populist. That
includes you China Mieville.</p><p>But using thought and education as a hammer against the spiky sticking out
loose iron nails of ignorance is based. I am a peaceful person, so I prefer
to hammer bad ideas, not people. Class warfare is war against an entire
class of people who are providing all goods to maintain the lifestyles of
the rich. Although really the wealthy disgust me so much (why not give away
all your excess? It is after-all&mldr; excess) that I just do not even want to
know them to have to resist the urge of hammering them for real.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;the realpolitik means we cannot avoid mixing with the
rich and powerful, because they hold reigns of power, so if we are to win
the class war we need a few of them on our side.&rdquo;</p><p>That is an argument.</p><p>But the reality is no number of rich people will win the class war. The
class war is won when the majority rise up united against neoliberalism and
neo-fascism. For the leftiepol nerds, let me define &ldquo;neoliberalism&rdquo; for you
so you do not misunderstand: it is the entire liberal elite who do little
real work and yet claim the majority of currency scorepoints, all the
while screaming at us we others need to be more unemployed to fight inflation.</p><p>You won&rsquo;t find that definition elsewhere, it is parochial for here at
Ohanga Pai.</p><p>Note that a democratic majority <em>power of the people</em> cannot be exclusionary
and ideological, it must embrace all people, even a few libertarian retards.
(We could probably do with a quota on them.) I like the sound of a
dictatorship of the proletariat, but it rings too strongly of violence and
intolerance, even though &ldquo;the proletariat&rdquo; would be such a diverse crowd!
It would have to include a few rich people too. Status as a proletarian
does not imply one is not wealthy.</p><p>Ah, crap. I guess I&rsquo;m going to go longer than Bill Mitchell today.</p><p>Maybe not&mldr; haven&rsquo;t I written enough? The Household Budget analogy
Nicola Willis is officially proclaiming is domestic terrorism.
It is <em>needless</em> austerity. Austerity kills poor people who might otherwise
have lived a little longer and contributed meaningful to a decent society.
The Tories are always paying lip service to a &ldquo;decent society&rdquo; but they
have no clue how to promote one in their policy analysis.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:15%><col span=1 style=width:25%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../49_debtcurve>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../49_debtcurve>Debt Curve</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
