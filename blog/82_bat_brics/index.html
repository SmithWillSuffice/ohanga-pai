had another round of discussion about BRICS and the
SWIFT system, SDR&rsquo;s and other related issues of international currencies.
While the purpose is good, I think a few things are worth noting, and I will
be mainly making a critique from a dirtbag leftie perspective. Some folks who
like the concept of BRICS might not appreciate this, but I hope you read
this and offer corrections if you think any are needed.</p><p><strong>Short synopsis: (a tldr for the busy)</strong></p><ol><li>It does not matter what currency a government is forced to pay in,
since there is always a forex rate, even for some of the poorest nations.
The issue is how to make the swap to make the payment, not the
currency unit.<br>     And the seller, generally a private sector agent motivated to sell, will most often make that exchange.</li><li>The issue is the fear of inflation — but when has a payment forced in
USD ever been inflationary? I can&rsquo;t see the mechanism for inflation only
because USD units are being demanded.<br>     Numeraires don&rsquo;t cause anything.</li><li>In any case, if exports are not strong then inflation can get passed
through if more imports are desired and the government supports more
imports at an increasing rate. It is the rate of increase in this case
(or import price hikes) that mostly effects inflation. But in this
case the imported inflation is not the weaponization of the dollar, but
your weak economy demanding more than it can itself supply.<br>     This falls under the heading
of <strong><em>Deficiency of non resident savings desires.</em></strong></li><li>The USA can weaponize payments layers in many ways, it is through the
transport layer, not the currency unit, e.g., by refusing payments,
imposing preferential prices/penalties, blockades, etc. That&rsquo;s the actual
weaponization occurring. That&rsquo;s the proper case to make for say a BRICS
<em>transport</em> system$^{}ddaggaer$, but you&rsquo;ll need a lot more than BRICS units.
Proper UN trade facilitation and dismantling and reforming the WTO to be
not a neoliberal attack dog.<br>     <strong><em>However</em></strong> the US would have to interfere
with payments between others for the BRICS payments to be a benefit. This is only
significant for currency-users, not currency-issuers. So the USA really have
no power at all through payments layers to cripple any nation, they don&rsquo;t
need to do it that way. Nations get crippled by USA &ldquo;dollar hegemony&rdquo;
only because they do not understand the power & purpose of their
<em>own</em> existing currencies.</li><li>Ultimately a seller of US goods with a US bank account will receive USD,
but you cannot call this weaponization! It is called &ldquo;desiring a US bank account&rdquo;.</li><li>You say, &ldquo;But what about pass through inflation?&rdquo; OK, but when has that
ever crippled a nation? It&rsquo;s all fear mongering. The source of inflation to
worry about is <em>not</em> coming from the payments layer. It comes from greed
and corruption, which BRICS is not going to fix.</li></ol><p>BRICS will help in moving where and who the more corrupt oligarchs live and
exploit. It might be a <em>very good thing</em> for the USA (absent active
lefties in the BRICS nations).</p><p>MMT is only a lens for all this analysis. The true solutions to the
oppression of the working class are spiritual. By which I only mean
compassion, solidarity, honesty, trustworthiness, wisdom. Armed with
these spiritual tools the working class can advance and defeat oligarchy.
MMT adds to the critical Knowledge component of Wisdom.</p><p>$^{}ddagger$Did someone just say &ldquo;One Belt One Road&rdquo;?</p><h2 id=for-the-global-south-the-problem-is-not-the-payments-layer><a class=anchor href=#for-the-global-south-the-problem-is-not-the-payments-layer title='Anchor for: For the Global South the Problem is not the Payments Layer.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>For the Global South the Problem is not the Payments Layer</h2><p>This reminded me of when years ago some MMT activist wanted privacy
respecting payments systems. I told him the means already exist, such
as the
<a href=https://taler.net/ target=_blank>GNU Taler</a>
software (for online payments only for now,
but that&rsquo;s not a huge downside). Full buyer anonymity${}^\dagger$. The
seller is however not private. This is by design, so they don&rsquo;t escape
the NIPA accounting.</p><p>&ldquo;But we have to protect anonymity of exploited workers like
prostitutes&mldr;,&rdquo; came the cry.</p><p><strong>Wrong!</strong> We have to protect <em>all</em> workers, and sex workers should not be
even worrying about the payments layer they use. The protection of <em>all</em>
workers is not through the payment layer.</p><p>Also, I do not see any sex workers organizing underground movements to
overthrow the oligarchs. But if they are, then great! But the payments
layer they use for work is neither here nor there.</p><p>You know, this strain in MMT circles is really just the same old colonization
of people&rsquo;s minds that the Austrian Schoolers and goldbugs have. Investing
far too much hope (for their ideological values) in currency systems.</p><p>It is the same with the UBI crowd. Giant mind worms. Appeasing people
with scorepoints they did not have to earn is fools gold. The
<a href=http://www.chiemgauer.info/ target=_blank>parallel currency folks</a>
are doing things
infinitely better &mdash; they understand the <em>purpose</em> of the tax-driven
currency system running on top. (Mini lesson: it is to deliberately create
unemployment, so the state can then get rid of the unemployment.)
As long as the State fails to fill the unemployment gap (same as spending
gap), a local parallel currency can always be successful in eliminating
local unemployment, with zero inflation pressure.</p><p>What MMT is very good at is clarifying one&rsquo;s perspective, so that
the monetary system of accounts is the least of our concerns.
It removes the bad Marxist cobwebs of &ldquo;the commodity form&rdquo; which was
always brain rot. This allows what is brilliant about Marxism to
shine brighter.</p><p>${}^\dagger$ (Up to NSA level belligerence in brute force reverse
engineering the flows of funds & goods to infer buyer identity. But no
currency can protect you from that spy craft.)</p><h3 id=do-foreigners-get-forced-to-pay-for-goods-in-dollars><a class=anchor href=#do-foreigners-get-forced-to-pay-for-goods-in-dollars title='Anchor for: Do foreigners get forced to pay for goods in dollars?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Do foreigners get forced to pay for goods in dollars?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Comment (a).</strong> It is a fundamental misunderstanding of monetary systems
to think the USA can force anyone to pay in US dollars, meaning need to
get US dollar scorepoints into their bank account first. While there is a
fee, international payments systems &mdash; mainly forex desks or dealer banks
or platforms like Western Union and other &mdash; allow you to pay for goods
sold in USD with your scorepoints in your bank account.</p><p>But even this misses the point. The dollar is just a numeraire. Anyone will
accept your currency for payment. The issue is how much you must give them
above the fair exchange rate. If you are in the black markets or dealing with
a real piece of sh1t monopolist, they might demand more than the fair
exchange rate.</p><p>Back in the old days when you travelled it was always handy to have a few
USD bills in your wallet, since everyone accepted them. But how the hell
did you get those greenbacks? Goodness knows&mldr; right? You musta&rsquo; run a
counterfeit press. &ldquo;Ye godz! Dollar hegemony!&rdquo;</p><p>As I say, still goldbugs colonizing your minds. Even some MMT&rsquo;ers who
should know better.</p><p><strong>Comment (b).</strong> Too many lefties are placing hope in freedom from the
&ldquo;US controlled&rdquo; payments systems and &ldquo;US dollar hegemony&rdquo;. Both these
are myth-making, which while not directly lacking class conscious
nevertheless seem on that verge.</p><h3 id=do-governments-get-forced-to-pay-for-goods-in-dollars><a class=anchor href=#do-governments-get-forced-to-pay-for-goods-in-dollars title='Anchor for: Do governments get forced to pay for goods in dollars?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Do governments get forced to pay for goods in dollars?</h3><p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.</p><p>They can always pay in their domestic currency. What seller is going to
refuse the sale?</p><p>If the purpose was to simply prevent a poor nation from getting the goods,
that does not require some evil government control of the SWIFT system
or anything else like it. The exporters just get told to not ship. No
payments layer is in sight.</p><p>To think it is the payments system or the currency numeraire is to have
a colonized goldbug mindset. MMT should free you from this.</p><p>However, I cannot stop governments from being stupid and self-imposing
dollar hegemmony on their people. They do so all the time. They should be
corralled by the worker party and ridiculed and taunted to death with
the Monty Python joke weapon.</p><h2 id=a-kiwi-lesson><a class=anchor href=#a-kiwi-lesson title='Anchor for: A Kiwi Lesson.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Kiwi Lesson</h2><p>Little New Zealand told the US nuclear powered vessels to find somewhere
else to dump their waste. A few threats were promised. Nothing bad happened.
Sure, New Zealand has no oil or lithium etc., so we&rsquo;re lucky. But that&rsquo;s a
parochial perspective. Whatever shaky foundations the United Nations was
laid upon, the collective nations of the world do not have to sit back idly
while poor mineral rich countries continue being exploited. Even then,
where does the exploitation arise from? It is <em>not</em> from the USA all alone,
it&rsquo;s from corruption of the leaders of those poor nations. They&rsquo;re greedy.
BRICS will not stop them being greedy for scorepoints &mdash; it does not have
to be USD accounts. Sorry it is so banal.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t write to me complaining I don&rsquo;t understand Realpolitik please. Any
powerful nation can exploit the weak, and it has nothing to do with needing
to control the payments layer. If you think it is, and you think BRICS is a
partial remedy, I think you are the more naïve. Like any tool controlled by
the elites, BRICS can be used for good or for bad. But it is the wrong place
to place your hopes.</p><p>You need to place your hopes in what you can control.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t control what word spew Jeffrey Sachs, Richard Wolff,
Yanis Varoufakis, and Michael Hudson emit, though I can hope their hearts
are in the right place.</p><p>What <em>can</em> a dirtbag leftie control?</p><p>We can control who we associate and organize with, and what we do off work
hours to organize (and how much time we waste looking at our smartphones).
So that&rsquo;s what you aught to place your hopes in. (I trust Grumbine recognizes
this as enough of a giant middle finger to the fake democracy
of &ldquo;electorialism&rdquo;.)</p><h2 id=further-realpolitik-and-inflation-of-name-tags><a class=anchor href=#further-realpolitik-and-inflation-of-name-tags title='Anchor for: Further Realpolitik and Inflation of Name Tags.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Further Realpolitik and Inflation of Name Tags</h2><p>The flip side of realpolitik you can have with MMT Lens understanding is
that it can work the other way against the hegemon. They cannot invade
every country refusing to host their warships or refusing to let the US
corporations be the ones extracting their mineral resources. International
solidarity of nations. Sounds like we need to set up some organization
called &ldquo;The United Peoples of the World and Their Puppet Representatives
Talking a Lot&rdquo;.</p><p>What &ldquo;did in&rdquo; Ghana back in the day? It was greed for the revenues.
Damn stupid. What was the big rush to develop into a high tech sophisticated
society? They were already more sophisticated than the USA apes. They just
didn&rsquo;t know it because Hollywood and all that carry-on which feeds the
world false ideology that to be sophisticated you need nice new whiteware
in your home, stocked with CocaCola, and these days own a
s̶t̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶a̶p̶p̶a̶r̶a̶t̶u̶s̶ ̶s̶u̶r̶v̶e̶i̶l̶l̶a̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶v̶i̶c̶e̶ smartphone.</p><p>A nicer looking place to store your beer. Very sophisticated.</p><p>The solidarity among the BRICS nations is by far the more hopeful thing for
their people. They can have a flash new payments system, but the more
important thing is standing up to help each other when an imperious nation
imposes sanctions and whatnot. Where were we all when Cuba was in need
of us? Nowhere to be found, to our shame. (Actually, I don&rsquo;t know,
maybe NZ exported to Cuba? We would not in 2025 had the blockade
begun now.)</p><p>Cautionary Tale though.</p><blockquote><p><em>Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.</em></p></blockquote><p>Pessimistically, that&rsquo;s how I see the BRICS when viewed only as an
escape from payments blocks by the US Treasury and/or Customs/Trade
agencies. Yes, the USA leadership and elites are like &ldquo;the evil empire&rdquo;
but there is still a lot of that greed and materialism going round. It
occupies entire lifetimes of activism contributing to slowly stamping it
all out a tiny bite at a time.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t pin your hopes on the currency system. It is not the place
for justice. Make it so your MMT understanding frees people&rsquo;s minds to
focus on what really matters. Our collective power, not the scorepoints.
Once &ldquo;the people&rdquo;
<a href=https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745337326/reclaiming-the-state/ target=_blank>Reclaim the State</a>
, the scorepoints can be then used wisely, instead of how they
are used today. Will this happen in our lifetimes? I don&rsquo;t know, but I
see enough <em>de facto</em> Accelerationism that I think it highly likely.</p><p>I still don&rsquo;t know if that is good or bad. It&rsquo;s the Mother of All
Bandaid Rippings Off! Each little hair torn off in the adhesive to
capitalism&rsquo;s blood clots is an innocent dead person. So&mldr; yeah, probably
better to get it ripped off sooner than later. It is a confused metaphor
I know, I don&rsquo;t know what the wound and bandaid&rsquo;s are analogies for, you
can dream that up yourself. I&rsquo;m thinking the wound is capital exploitation
of workers clearly, most of whom today do not even see themselves as
exploited. So there are other Bodily symptoms too, like depressions and
suicides and oxycontin epidemics. If I was Cutrone I guess I&rsquo;d say the
bandaid and Panadol is a dictatorship of the Proletariat?</p><p>I did not think this essay would come to such a bloody end!</p><p>I just wanted to warn friends to be careful in what they say about BRICS.
If you rant too much about the &ldquo;US dollar collapsing&rdquo; you risk looking
a fool and the Boy Who Cried Wolf. Or Chicken Little. I&rsquo;m not sure which.</p><p>I guess the US dollar collapsing is Boy Who Cried Wolf, since <em>before</em>
the US dollar collapses, the US government might just cease to exist
an hour earlier. I don&rsquo;t know how, but it&rsquo;d be in the abstract. Like
the GOP somehow manage complete and utter fooling of a majority under
fake populism, and then whoever is in the Whitehouse just plays golf
forever and stuffs their face with fast food, while in secret leaving
the entire Sate apparatus over to Musk and Co. to run as a
lab experiment.</p><p>In that case the USD might come and go on a bi-yearly basis as they
figure out whether cryptotokens can be actual currency or not, and
whether the the US dollar scorepoints are not in fact already cryptotokens
(hint: they <em>are</em> &mdash; ever tried to crack a Bank? You&rsquo;ll need at least
Kali-Linux for that).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve lost track of how many people, both left-wing and right-wing claim
&ldquo;the US dollar will collapse&rdquo;. The lucky thing for them the
Boy Who Cried Wolf parable is no longer modern era applicable. The media
is not holding the alt-media or the media to account for bad calls. Or when
they do, CNN style, it&rsquo;s always &ldquo;We said a lie, but when on air guys, just
say it was miss-reporting.&rdquo; 24 hours later all is not forgiven, it is just
not remembered.</p><p>Having got that bit of cynicism off my chest, I am well aware I&rsquo;ve taken
the fragile side, not the anti-fragile. So it is a bad move. It always
pays to be the doomsayer, since no one holds you to account if nothing
bad happens, but if something perchance bad happens you&rsquo;re the Nostradamus.</p><p>Having got that bit of cynical cynicism off my other chest, who is going
to attack me when it happens and say I was an idiot for not seeing the
US dollar collapse? Luckily probably no one. It won&rsquo;t matter either,
since I do not own any investments. I&rsquo;ll just work as usual to get the
new government scorepoints even as those libertarians refuse to call
themselves &ldquo;big government.&rdquo; What are they? &ldquo;Scientists and futurologists
of legal dispute resolutions and Ai driven tax credit scorepoint accounting.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>In other news:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2NzzF0zJcY" target=_blank>wtf happened to Bill Mitchell?</a>
I love the guy. But he&rsquo;s such a Doomer. It does not help to say,
&ldquo;civilizations collapse, get used to it&rdquo;. Hell no to that.</p><p>Normally I&rsquo;d shoot myself for saying this, but sometimes, just sometimes,
it pays to be a pollyanna. Too much digging into ecological collapse
forecasts and Degrowth circle groupthink, I think, can lead to
depression. But that&rsquo;s a killer. I know.</p><p>The 𝔣𝔘ℭ𝔎ℑ𝔑𝔊 right-wing ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗𝔰 know how to wish their world into being, they
never suffer from depression. They just take action&mldr; by finding a new
neck to stomp upon (also called charging rents). On the liberal-left wing
there is too much doomerism and hopelessness. It is all warranted, but it
is useless. So take it, but don&rsquo;t hold onto it, pass it along.</p><p>However, as someone prone to lifelong social anxiety and depression I know
it is not easy to have a pollyanna outlook. Heck, why <em>do</em> I? Everything in
your heart & soul begs you to be an honest realist. I think it is like
the Jimmie Hendrix effect. You need to take drugs to just get
back to normal person mental state. The thing is, you just never fool
yourself into thinking you are <strong><em>not</em></strong> being a polyanna. That&rsquo;s the
trick. You have to know you are a wild optimist, and so are not fooling
yourself.</p><p>If it helps, I could mention something about quantum probabilities! The
future is not determined by the past folks, it just isn&rsquo;t. Call me if you
want to learn more about that! It is not a recipe for pollyannaish
optimism, it&rsquo;s just a hint of a possibility. Sometimes that&rsquo;s enough to
spur good people into action. (One of the insidious things the Obama people
sold, was in fact a good thing: <strong><em>hope</em></strong> &mdash; it was just too bad they
were not offering any for actual over-the-counter sale to the plebs,
oxvcontin instead.)</p><p>Empires collapse far more frequently than civilizations. The (inevitable)
ecological crisis will collapse oligarchic empires for certain, it does not
have to collapse civilization. Believe it or not, I reckon it is easily
possible to have many current empires collapse with the working class
stiffs hardly aware anything happened. Why? Because so damn unequal we
are already.</p><p>One Tory 𖧳𖧥𖨚𖢧𖧥𖦪𖦧&rsquo;𖨚 &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; is a working class stiffs daylight.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s gedankepolitik for another day, and also fruitless speculation,
