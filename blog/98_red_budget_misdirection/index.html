by funding in nominal terms, without question.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Can we &ldquo;afford&rdquo; a green energy transition?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, because we already have the real resources needed, maybe
not the time to do so to avoid catastrophes, but all that means is the
government investment is needed without further delay, and this can easily
be done&mldr; in monetary terms. The obstacle is pure political will and
mal-education, nothing else. Mainly lack of spiritual education, but
scientific as well.</p><p>And yes, for the title today, the NZ government budget was Red. Red here
meaning <font style="color: indianred">burning things up</font>, not
<font style="color: red">communist red!</font> Oh the frickin&rsquo; ignorance
of it all. They are all &mdash; politicans and journalists alike &mdash; still
moaning and whining about the &ldquo;debt&rdquo; and &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; all failing to realize
there are always two sides to every
accounting ledger. The government budget is <em>always</em> in balance, if not then
someone made an accounting mistake. Their red ink is our black ink. To
the last balanced penny.</p><p>The politicians and journalists never mention the government debt
equals private sector savings, and that all these outstanding accounting
records are in the bank accounts of the Top Ten Percent, instead of where
it belongs which is in the bank accounts of the workers.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> (Now don&rsquo;t get too alienated here). Can we &ldquo;get off oil&rdquo;?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> No, we cannot. We need oil for chemical feedstocks vital for
modern life, and the global south should not be deprived of such development
pathways that we all enjoyed (or at least the Boomers did). But&mldr; we can
certainly afford to stop burning the fossil fuels. Big Oil does not need
to be Big Pollution.</p><h1 id=we-cannot-afford-_not_-to-invest-in-renewables>We Cannot Afford <em>Not</em> to Invest in Renewables</h1><p>The real answer here though is that we simply cannot afford to continue
burning fossil fuels and pumping out concrete, crypotocurrency, chatbot
server farm crud, and other noxious emissions.
The real cost (not monetary cost) the <em>real cost</em> of failure to invest in
renewable energy and energy conservation efforts today will be massive real
costs in the future, far
exceeding the real cost to us today of making the investments.</p><p>We are talking about real costs, not monetary costs. The relevant costs for
a government in only real stuff, that is, moving labour and output towards
green energy infrastructure rather than nice television and opera, cosmetic
vanities, and fashion accessories. But in reality, we probably do not need to
sacrifice performance of a single opera. The effort to build renewable energy
resources is not all that overwhelming. It just takes a bit of time.</p><p>Do not fall for the Prof Steve Keen myth that we lack the minerals. We do
not lack the minerals. That idea is premised on the assumption we have to
keep increasing energy output rate. In truth we do not. We already
over-produce, and cutting back on energy rate of consumption is not going
to lower the median standard of living at all. Just think of all the
enormous amount of crap you buy that you never needed. Including that
second Smartphone.</p><p>Quit buying that stuff, you do not need it.</p><h2 id=true-investment><a class=anchor href=#true-investment title='Anchor for: True Investment.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>True Investment</h2><p>It constantly surprises me so many capitalistic minded so-called &ldquo;Investors&rdquo;
fail to grasp all this, and wish to just leave things up to so-called
&ldquo;free markets&rdquo; to sort out.</p><p>These idiots are fake investors. They forgot the meaning of the term &ldquo;invest&rdquo;.
You know damn well why too, because to these bastards &ldquo;investment&rdquo; means
monetary returns. Whereas the ethical investor is always seeking real
returns, not monetary returns. People who seek monetary returns are net
anti-investors. Clearly, by definition. They are the savers, they are the
ones who reduce currency circulation and force government to run more
massive deficits.</p><p>They are promoters of austerity, because no matter what circulation their
investments generate, the fact they net save means someone else has to be
spending more than their income. Dollars to donuts that is some low paid
worker who can ill afford to slide further into bank debt. But it doesn&rsquo;t
have to be that way, because the government can in fact run large deficits,
in perpetuity, and thereby prevent the lowest income families from suffering
bank debt.</p><p>It is all about where the government net spending ends up. The problem being
it is not going to those who need it. It is good we have government deficits,
but very not good who it all gets channelled towards in our present era
of gross neoliberal class war macroeconomics.</p><p>Wrong idea! Market investment only works via profit motive if the returns
can be realized in the short run. But the returns to investment in renewable
energy technology are far in the future, they are the returns of not
suffering massive ecological collapse.</p><p>This is true whether you believe the science that millions will lose their
communities due to sea level rise, and millions may die of wet bulb
conditions, millions will starve from subsequent agricultural production
collapse in these wet bulb regions. This is before we start talking about
possible desertification or ocean AMOC Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation collapse.</p><p>These tipping points might be mere possibilities, not inevitability. But
the fact they have non-zero probability of occurring is the reason to invest
in renewables and mitigation, and even if possible reversal of our rate
of energy consumption.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Can this be achieved without job losses and mass unemployment?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, of course. The government is the source of all unemployment,
and has the sole authority to eliminate all the unemployment It creates.
Jobs will be lost in some industries, but without unemployment. If people need
employment then there are endless good things they can do for their community, pleasant things, far better than digging up coal or burying nuclear waste.
The government can always pay these wages, without question,without inflation
bias, and with much greater fair compensation than a welfare hand-out.</p><p>As with most macroeconomic issues, it is always about government
willingness to spend, not capacity to spend. They have infinite capacity
to spend.</p><p>For government policy then, the focus has to be on the real costs of
failure to spend, not on the money amount. The money amount is utterly
irrelevant if you are the monopoly creator of the currency.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Can the invisible hand of The Market turn Big Oil (or any
other industry) into a non-polluter?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> I would say no, the evidence is overwhelming that government
regulation is absolutely necessary. In any case, every MMT aware person
knows the government creates the entire market in the first place, for goods
with prices denominated in the state&rsquo;s unit of account.</p><p>I doubt we will be transitioning to pastoral life styles and local currencies
without central governments any time soon. Although that utopia appealing
to me, I have to be realistic. I&rsquo;m not asking <em>you</em> to be realistic.
I&rsquo;m self-imposing realism austerity on myself, ok.</p><p>Besides, if we did soon transition to simple pastoral lifestyles that would
imply in-between times millions of people have died. It is an Accelerationist
scenario. You&rsquo;d need a total collapse of systems to destroy central
government. Maybe this will come to pass, but I&rsquo;m not fond of entertaining
that scenario, if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p><p>We can be more civilized.</p><p>Yeah, but you won&rsquo;t be more civilized if you have a backwards understanding
of the monetary system, and if you falsely believe the government must tax
us to create it&rsquo;s own scorepoints at Its own central bank.</p><p>Does the scorekeeper in a game of Bridge or Scrabble have to get the
scorepoints off the players first?</p><p>Answer is no. Government does not get Its own currency off the tax payer.
When taxes are paid the currency is destroyed. All that remains is an
accounting record of the redemption operation. You extinguished some
units of tax liability. The government did not get anything useful from
this, except the accounting record. These accounting records can of course
be useful for some analysis purposes, but really they are not terribly useful
and if we lost the hard drives with these records on them no one would
starve or die.</p><p>Right. So <em>Finding the Money</em> is never the problem. Finding the Votes is
the problem.</p><p>Catch-22 though? We cannot find the votes for green energy investments
because the people running our governments still idiotically believe
the government has to get the NZD scorepoints off the tax payer, or by
borrowing from private banks who have no counterfeit capacity.</p><p>I promised a reader I&rsquo;d talk about credit money some time, but let&rsquo;s just
make a bookmark here that banks cannot fund anything. They only get charter
from the state to issue credit, with interest. So that is net negative money.
However, while that credit circulates it does promote more economic
activity. It is the economic activity that is enhanced through commercial
banking operations, not the NET money supply that also needs to grow for a
growing population.</p><p>Only the monopoly issuer of the currency can create the necessary growing
money supply. This is called government deficit spending. But it is healthier
to refer to it as net private savings. Or if you want to be stock&ndash;flow
consistent in language it is net private income.</p><p>The resource the government lacks is sufficient votes in Parliament.</p><p>Today I want to boost a good piece by Prof. Bill Mitchell on the need and
howto for a just transition to a renewable energy economy. Renewable, that is,
for as long as the star we call the Sun is stable and human civilization has
not yet collapsed.</p><p>However, this needs constant repetition and amplification, and at the end of
this episode I&rsquo;ll have more to say about the repetition and amplification.</p><hr><p>In MMT and climate justice activism we have a unification with economic
justice. There are no trade-offs here, it is all a virtuous circle.</p><p>If the messaging gets tedious for you, I urge you to be creative. We need
to repeat the same damn messages <em>ad infinitum</em>, until the government policy
responses propagate through to markets and things improve for all people, and
all future generations (until the sun stops shinning).</p><p>But you do not want to get stale and tedious I reckon. At least I don&rsquo;t.
You do not have to.
Any good idea can be re-presented in many ways. If you think you have
exhausted all forms of activism then I am afraid you have a dim imagination.
And in that case your activism can afford a period of learning just how to
be more creative. Take an art class or something.</p><h2 id=the-one-real-resource-we-lack><a class=anchor href=#the-one-real-resource-we-lack title='Anchor for: The One Real Resource We Lack.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The One Real Resource We Lack</h2><p>The last topic today is the real resource we are most critically failing
to fully employ, and it is the most critical resource of all the good
things we desire.</p><p>Earlier I noted the real resource the government lacks is votes in Parliament.
They do not lack the currency units, &ldquo;finding the money&rdquo; is an inapplicable
concept for a monopoly creator of tax credits in a tax-driven single
currency region.</p><p>But the most critical resource we lack is not the votes in Parliament. I&rsquo;ll
give you a second to guess what it is&mldr;</p><p>I am talking about macroeconomic policy education.</p><p>Without sufficient MMT education there will never be the votes we need. And
thus there will never be the good regulations to correct the malevolent
market forces we need. With only austerity on the agenda the consumer will
be powerless to force change for the good on climate, employment, anti-fascism,
anti-war movements, or anything else. We&rsquo;ll be too crippled needing to work
for a disgusting boss just to eat.</p><p>We have a massive Knowledge and wisdom deficit among our liberal elites who
are running the government show.</p><p>They are so badly ignorant it is bordering now on downright evil
destruction. Galactic Evil Empire proportions. And this is true even
for many Green Party MP&rsquo;s. How many of them still stupidly believe the
government needs to get the currency off the counterfeit printing presses
of the proverbial tax payer?</p><p>Wake up people!</p><p>Your ignorance is killing us.</p><p>No pitchforks and protests can remove this weapon of mass destruction
called ignorance. Journalists and teachers can destroy these weapons.
Just think about it. Macroeconomics ignorance has been more destructive
than the nuclear bomb. There has never been a more destructive force in
all human history than this ignorance.</p><p>Does that now make you want to start teaching people about MMT?
If not, I&rsquo;m lost as to how to help you.
But I will repeat the message in a thousand creative ways anyway before I die.
No self-immolation protesting for me. I am going for the far more painful path
of trying to educate the wilfully ignorant.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../97_how_strong_is_your_outrage>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../99_shmapitalism>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../97_how_strong_is_your_outrage>How Strong Is Your Outrage?</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../99_shmapitalism>Shmapitalism</a></td></tr></table></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
