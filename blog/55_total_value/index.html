slightly open.</p><h3 id=labour-theory-of-value-is-not-total-value><a class=anchor href=#labour-theory-of-value-is-not-total-value title='Anchor for: Labour Theory of Value is Not Total Value.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Labour Theory of Value is Not Total Value</h3><p>Wray does a nice job summarizing Marx, and not in the Monty Python Proust
way, although that would have been cool too. (Someone should do that skit.)
He leaves out a lot of Steve Keen&rsquo;s contribution, which is unfortunate, but
it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;ok&rdquo; for beginners.</p><p>To follow are some bullet-point style further summaries, they are essential
points of note before reading the rest of my post.</p><ol><li>Marx did not understand money, he borrowed too much uncritically from
Ricardo and Adam Smith. Even a little bit of a bad thing can be a bad thing.
In mathematics one little error can destroy the entire edifice. Thus, when in
doubt, you use probabilities, not didactic statements as if you are the boss
of all economics philosophy. Marx played too much the boss.</li><li>The gold commodity is not the state&rsquo;s monetary unit, and so cannot be the
source of the price level.</li><li>One might estimate the labour time + energy to dig gold out of the ground,
but this is a laughable theory of how the price is determined. One cannot
use a single operation or process. Prices are always nominal, and gain social
currency only when pegged or gauged against some common real process. Digging
gold out of the Earth is not a common enough process for a decent theory of
monetary value. This renders most of Marx&rsquo;s analysis of the &ldquo;money form&rdquo;
ridiculous and obsolete.</li><li>All real value is derived from a combination of free energy + labour.</li><li>In a fair political economy the relative real values would be reflected in the nominal value, the latter is the currency unit of account.</li><li>In all current political economies there is no fairness, and the nominal
values do not correlate well with the relative real values. Prices are not
entirely random, but the relative ratios are heavily distorted by those who
wield undue political power over others.</li><li>Nevertheless, the only one relative value that truly matters is the price
of labour. But
this is not saying the LTV is correct. What is morally true is that
<em>in a <strong>fair</strong> system</em> the workers would be fairly compensated, so their
labour would be accurately valued in nominal terms, by comparison with real
output <em>the entire system</em> can produce.<br>      (If it is not possible to measure real
output, it can still be estimated. Statisticians and decent
econometricians are not total dummies. Hence workers can always be granted
an approximately fair compensation. Disgruntlement at the edges, although
something to be minimized, is not a completely terrible thing to have to
tolerate if the alternative is an autocracy.)</li><li>Principle <strong>7</strong> says that if it is possible to measure real output (within
reasonable uncertainty bounds) then workers can always be granted a wage
commensurate with their fair share of that output. This cannot be market
determined.</li><li>Point <strong>8</strong> says wages cannot be market determined, this is because markets
distort relative prices whenever there is accumulation of monopoly pricing
power. In such cases the monopoly currency issuer has a moral obligation to
make the workers whole. This is because, as MMT shows, the monopoly currency
issuer is the price setter, not price taker. They do so by providing a wage
floor via a Job Guarantee. The JG policy is not merely economic pragmatism,
it is also moral pragmatism (the bare minimum moral economic policy).</li><li>Defining a unit of account is remarkably similar to defining engineering
units, like &ldquo;the kilogram&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the second&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the metre&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the ampere&rdquo;.
Only because governments (the people who run them) have no clue about this,
they turn what should be an exact isomorphism into less than a mere analogy,
they do not even think of the state currency unit in such metrology terms, but
they <em>should</em>.<br>      This stuffs up a lot of things in society,
so much is f$\ast\ast$d up in fact that it is an epic tragedy. As in
<em>biblically epic</em>.</li></ol><p>I don&rsquo;t blame Marx for this epic tragedy. Everyone who was sucked-in by
Adam Smith and Ricardo is to blame &mdash; so millions of people can be blamed?
Yeah, I would say millions. That&rsquo;s on the low side. You should not follow
tradition unless you carefully scrutinize it and find it agreeable, true,
kind, and honest.</p><p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s economics came from a good place, he was a moral philosopher, but
that does not make the analysis he handed down to Marx any more honest or good
and healthy to swallow.
Marx may have had a deep and abiding concern and compassion for the working
class, but because he was morally righteous in this respect does not excuse
his careless and uncritical acceptance of large chunks of Adam Smith&rsquo;s
thought.</p><p>I could say the same for MMT. We should not uncritically accept MMT analysis.
You need to always take an MMT analysis as fresh: have they considered
political power? Have they considered spiritual economics (kindness, altruism,
compassion, sacrifice, ecological sensitivity)? If not, then I&rsquo;d not want to
give it any credence or attention, no matter how correct the analysis was in
monetary system comprehension.</p><h3 id=some-comments-through-the-open-door><a class=anchor href=#some-comments-through-the-open-door title='Anchor for: Some Comments Through the Open Door.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Some Comments Through the Open Door</h3><p>In lieu of more academic writing, I&rsquo;ll just for now paste the comments I made
below the Real Progressive eidos with Randy Wray.</p><p><strong>Thoughts on the &ldquo;need to read&rdquo; Marx:</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-QTARhp5qS8?t=1158" target=_blank>@19:00</a>
I have something to tell
fellow MMT&rsquo;ers. You could bother to read
Marx but only to be able to be sympathetic to actual living marxists. If you
are already sympathetic then reading <em>Das Kapital</em> is a waste of your precious
time${}^\ast$. There is nothing in Marx&rsquo;s works that is not better understood
in the MMT literature. Even power dynamics and &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; (if you find the
good MMT stuff, like Mitchell).<br>      ${}^\ast$Because anything you get from
Marx that the living marxist does not accept is useless in your
dialogue/dialectic with them, and anything they think is in Marx which is
incorrect is useless to you in the dialectic with them. Instead, read a bit
of Marx, and then when you encounter an actual living marxist just ask them
their opinion. In fact this works wonders for dialectic with any ideologue of
any colour or stripe,&mldr; yes, even a libertarian LOL. You need to understand
where they are coming from, make the effort to talk in peace.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Thoughts on theory of value:</strong></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-QTARhp5qS8?t=1441" target=_blank>@24:30</a>
this leaves some territory
open for me to blog about. Wray&rsquo;s version
of LTV is fine for what it is, but in the real world things do not actually
trade over the counter according to LTV. Plus you are missing S. Keen &mdash; not
all real value put into real output is from labour, in fact these days labour
is a minuscule amount, meaning you need to look at how energy is produced
using all that &ldquo;dead labour&rdquo; + free energy from Nature. Better to give this
a proper name, like &ldquo;Total energy theory of value&rdquo; which accounts for both
labour and free energy, let&rsquo;s call it TETV let&rsquo;s say.<br>      We all know lower level workers are
grossly under-paid, and a tonne of commodity is way over-priced, sometime
ridiculously (a van Gogh, or a Gucci thing, etc). On top of the LTV + we have
TETV, but on top of TETV we have TSTV = Total Social Theory of Value &mdash; which
accounts not just for labour + free energy but for people who have more
social power who are able to monopolize sources of free energy (primarily
land and the sun light that shines upon the land). Those people have a huge
say in determining the monetary unit exchange value, and if given too much
power they can completely subvert the more natural LTV (which discounts
nature&rsquo;s free energy) and can make workers pay through the nose for simple
commodities necessary for a humble decent non-ostentatious life.<br>      It begs the question when reading Marx
and derivatives, what the heck good is LTV when all the socially important
factors in living a decent life are completely subverted in price by
political power? Answer is, LTV is only good for stupid nerds who like to
idly think about a toy model &ndash; the, &ldquo;what if political power had no say in
price determination&mldr;&rdquo; &mdash; completely useless thinking time.</p></blockquote><h3 id=robot-theory-of-value><a class=anchor href=#robot-theory-of-value title='Anchor for: Robot Theory of Value.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Robot Theory of Value</h3><p>About 26 mins in Wray talks about various other &ldquo;theories of value&rdquo;. In our
times we should be looking at &ldquo;oil theory of value&rdquo;". In a mechanized future
perhaps a &ldquo;robot theory of value&rdquo;. That all sounds nice and good, but what
does it really mean?</p><p>Wray correctly answers that if we are serious about realistic economic
analysis &mdash; fair distribution of total output &mdash; then we have to have a
theory of how real output gets produced. This implies both Labour and Energy
theories. If we ignore the factors going into production, we have an
incomplete analysis. A theory of the inputs is also necessary because none of
the inputs to production are self-replicating and self-sustaining. Energy
systems need maintenance, and also periodic modernization. Labour needs a
caring social fabric and healthcare.</p><p>If the robots are self-reproducing, then who really needs a theory of robot
value? What we would require is a theory of robot control. Then this theory
must be implemented! Or at least the best theory we can come up with.</p><p>It is no good having self-replicating robots if they only serve the Top Ten
Percent, leaving us plebs &ldquo;free&rdquo; to fight over the scraps, over the robot
surplus.</p><p>It should be then clear that a proper &ldquo;theory of value&rdquo; cannot ignore the
moral dimension. Yet all economics theories of value ignore the moral
dimension. Marx did come closest to a moral economics.</p><p>In such a scifi future, which God willing may become sci-fact, we will still
need a labour theory of value. Even if humans are doing far less work, and
have far more leisure, we will still need to be working hard to help each
other, in whatever way. Even with robotic assistance all around. Since we
would have been the creatures who created the robots, we aught not relinquish
our status as creators. There is simply no need to be nihilistic about a
roboticized dystopia where humans become extinct due to our worthlessness.
Such nihilism is patently absurd. Yet, nor should we go the other extreme
and grant ourselves lordship and domain over Nature. Nature Bats Last, so is
always ready (so-to-speak) to humble the arrogant.</p><h3 id=setting-the-quantity-not-the-price><a class=anchor href=#setting-the-quantity-not-the-price title='Anchor for: Setting the Quantity, Not the Price.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Setting the Quantity, Not the Price</h3><p>Wray makes a good point about 42 minutes in: in many cases governments are
setting quantity, not price. &ldquo;We want 50 new armoured tanks this year for the
local kindergarten bosses.&rdquo; (I will use a school or kindergarten as an
example of a public sector organization, but the discussion is supposed to
be generic.))</p><p>This can be ok if quantity is indeed the appropriate target. The issue MMT has
with policies of setting quantity targets for everything is that is is plainly
bone-headed. Why set a quantity of employed labour when in fact you can always
employ all idle wiling labour, and set a floor price? There is no reason not
to, unless you fail to understand the monetary system.</p><p>Private industry cannot provide such a labour guarantee, only a monopoly
issuer of the currency can provide that guarantee, and by all moral accounts,
it should implement the guarantee.</p><p>But even in the case of the kindergarten teachers, the government should not
be fixing quantity, because they cannot control these things. The government
(mostly) does not use birth control methods, and cannot control how many new
children there will be going to kindergarten next year. The best policy is to
allow quantity to float, and fix price. Then supply the currency needed. This
way kindergarten bosses can purchase all the play equipment they need keep
the children happy.</p><p>This however leaves a problem. If the kindergarten managers are given currency
to meet their purchasing demands, the supply of materials is still finite.
So there must be some rationing system, in place. If that is a market then
there is price bidding, which risks inflationary distortions, and power
dynamics. But if every kindergarten has the same purchasing power per head of
children then this solves the problem. Hence the need for budgets.</p><p>If the schools are bidding in a reasonably fair market, so there is some
competition between suppliers, then the government need not worry too much
about fixing price, and can permit the schools to purchase what they need at
market rates. The inflationary risk of such markets is pretty minimal.
Although government is providing all the currency without explicit constraint,
their allocations to the school are per capita of student, so there is
always an implicit currency constraint.</p><p>When the funding agency is the monopoly currency issuer the budget
is <em>not</em> supposed to be in nominal currency units, it has to be, or <em>should be</em>
in real units.
The fair share of each kindergarten is per head of children, in real terms.
Government merely provides whatever amount of scorepoints are needed to
purchase the resources at a fixed price. For governments, budgets are moral
and resource constrained documents. They are not monetary constraint documents.
All the monetary constraint in a budget is implicit, and known only after
the fact.</p><p>There is still room for corruption. The supplier of toy equipment might become
a monopolist, so might demand a higher price than is fair, but the government
can always pay the price, so affordability for the school is never a problem.</p><p>The problem is political, since that higher price could, sometimes, lead to
one-off upwards price adjustment. Some people mistakenly call this
&ldquo;inflation&rdquo;. Be that as it may, it cannot cause hyperinflation. However, it
is still a potential political corruption problem. Government have the means
to deal with this, by properly and fairly regulating private monopolies.
Those private firms are, after all, using state services, in particular they
use the state&rsquo;s currency. Something fair should be demanded in return
concerning conforming to reasonable corruption-free business practices.</p><p>Or is &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; only for those who can afford it?</p><h2 id=monetization><a class=anchor href=#monetization title='Anchor for: Monetization.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Monetization</h2><p>This was a very good portion of the discussion. Wray points out that MMT
activists are going to have a hard time insisting government determine the
price level. That&rsquo;s because, even if government policy determines the price
level it is never clear to most ordinary people this is what is happening.</p><p>People look around themselves and think they want money to buy a car, or
groceries, or get their Netflix. They do not ordinarily consider the real
reason they need currency is because the government has imposed tax
liabilities.</p><p>MMT is in the difficult position of stating a fact about the monetary system
that most people cannot easily see. Like scientists before Atomic Theory become
recognized and widely accepted (that was, remarkably, really only after
Einstein&rsquo;s work on Brownian motion &mdash; well after John Dalton).</p><p>Doubly frustrating is that once you learn MMT the concept is not difficult
to understand. The monopolist always dictates price. They cannot help it, one
way or another. They can allow a market to set a price by fixing quantity, but
it is still the monopolists choice of pricing policy. People generally fail to
see this in the case of government currency systems. But it is plainly true:
the government is the price setter, in one way or another, meaning that it
must follow from government policy.</p><p>What governments tend not to get involved with is then relative price of goods
the government is not supplying. This permits a secondary market to form,
exchanging goods in the states unit of account, but at prices determined by
relative market value. (Like &ldquo;voting with your wallet&rdquo;".) It is not a fair
system, because some buyers have more purchasing power that is <em>unearned</em>, the
privileged rich. So it is never a truly fair market.</p><p>If the richer people earned their currency, then it&rsquo;d be a different story. If
one is contributing a mighty amount into the economy, one might expect a
greater share of purchasing power, as a simple matter of justice. But no one
can possibly, physically, command thirty times the purchasing power of some
other worker. No one can possibly work <em>that</em> hard.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:25%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../54_central_splanning>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../54_central_splanning>Cold Wars, New Wars</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=./>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
