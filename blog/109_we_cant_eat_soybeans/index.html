It is not &ldquo;crashing&rdquo;. The rhetoric of a &ldquo;crash&rdquo; implies some sort of
unrecoverable disaster, like a global pandemic, or drought, or global warming.
All of which might happen, but not this year. This is at least not the case
with the USA this year. The US government has despicably failed to
guarantee full employment, and has no clue about the reality of monetary
operations. That&rsquo;s what is killing their economy, scorekeeping, not some
fundamental economic fragility. For heavens sake, they have a massive
labour surplus they seem to not know what to do with! It&rsquo;s an embarrassment
of riches. Doubly embarrassing since even dirtbag MMT yours truly could think
of heaps of things their people could be doing to improve the quality of
life in the USA for everyone. Forget the rest of their fake-religion
christofascism. They are just blithering ùïöùëëüÑ∏üÖæùòµS of the highest clerical
order &mdash; which is bad enough on its own!</p><p>Let there be no doubt though, the failure to run proper scorekeeping is
fundamentally a complete lack of humanity, probably fully fascistic, but at
least racially prejudiced, and 100% class warfare. What else can it be when
the fundamental problem <em>today</em> is just bad scorekeeping?</p><p>The liberal-neoliberals can at least run the scorekeeping system to not
cause unemployment and bankruptcies to go to records non-crisis highs.
I still scratch my head at how effective TEMOTPIH has been at making a
real goods economic crisis out of simply bad scorekeeping. With the Mars King
booted out in fairly short order, I&rsquo;d not have thought it&rsquo;d go south so
quickly. Automatic stabilizers and all that &mdash; always usually just enough that
the suicide rate among the unemployed is &ldquo;tolerable&rdquo; in polite upper class
dinner party circles.</p><p>You surely do not need neocon fascism <em>at the same time</em>, but unfortunately
here you are, and it has ripple effects even down in NZ where our Tories are
christo-fash emboldened too, and also wrecking our economy, thanks to your
lead in the USA.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s get some perspective on real crash versus fake-crash.</p><p>The fake crash is in currency, the fiscal injections &ldquo;falling off a cliff&rdquo;
(going to zero). That&rsquo;s all Deficit Myth driven stuff, the US Democrats might have
acknowledged MMT, but they are too chicken-Íï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° to admit it for fear of
losing donors. They&rsquo;d sacrifice low paid workers and the unemployed instead,
and we should always remember the calculus, it benefits them if the economy
tanks under the GOP. (&ldquo;See, we&rsquo;re the &lsquo;fiscal responsible ones&rsquo; Mr Business
lobby!&rdquo; &mdash; they [if not full Clintonite nutcases] proceed to turn back on
the fiscal injections, but never enough to eliminate unemployment.)</p><p>Why would the centrist Neoliberals eliminate unemployment? No good reason huh,
since the working class are no longer their &ldquo;base&rdquo;. The working class have
no government representation at present, not anywhere. not even from Lula in
Brazil. Talk about <em>taxation without representation!</em> It&rsquo;s at obscene levels
not seen since the War of Independence.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is a Kiwi writing so much about the USA?&rdquo;, I hear you ask? The answer is
because what the USA does has poodles like NZ neoliberals following in the
fart streams.</p><p>Anyway, this post was to spit out my comments on a ridiculous Kyle Kulinski
fearstream.</p><p>To be fair, he&rsquo;s not wrong the GOP <em>are</em> screwing things up mightily, but
Kulinski&rsquo;s reasoning was still all backwards, as hard as it is to fathom. My
thinking is if he said it all correctly, it would spell <em>a lot worse</em> than his
pronouncements, because it is not going to be a &ldquo;crash&rdquo;, it will just be more
long suffering seemingly without end. <em>Never Let a Crisis Go to Waste</em>.</p><p>The Democrats will come into power and spew, &ldquo;We have to suck it up and
tighten our belts thanks to Trump&rsquo;s GOP, blame them!&rdquo; Blame them for
poor scorekeeping, but not yourselves???</p><p>But&mldr; yeah&mldr; <em>this time</em> it could be different (as I acknowledged in my
last post). We will see. And not before too long. But even if TEMOTPIH fails
to create a real crash, rather than just a financial crash, it does not ever
make the pain felt by working families and the unemployed (through no fault
of their own) any less horrific.</p><h2 id=korrekting-kulinski><a class=anchor href=#korrekting-kulinski title='Anchor for: Korrekting Kulinski.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Korrekting Kulinski</h2><p><strong>Part-1.</strong> of <em>Couple of corrections [to Kulinksi]</em>:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> Your economy is not yet
crushed, your farmers can still grow soybeans, your trouble is US citizens do
not want to eat them all. Trade is about getting as many imports for as few
exports as possible. Your exports are your real loss, not your benefit (the
Chinese firms buying soybeans cannot make US$, in fact they tend to save in
US Treasuries, a demand withdrawal which provides more fiscal space for US
government spending). The problem is, your government is not filling that
currency vacuum, the evidence is unemployment. Read The Deficit Myth &mdash; no, I
mean actually read it this time!</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> Your export farm lobby is really an enemy of the USA, their interest
is in the foreign buyer, and lower domestic wages. A farm policy should
instead be 90% domestic, feed your own people first. Not just with soybeans,
grow some other crops. Whatever excess you produce there is always a foreign
buyer, at some price, e.g., farm starved nations. Give them a discount, it&rsquo;s
the humane thing to do in trade (which is more often &ldquo;the opposite of
religion, better to receive than to give.&rdquo;)</p><p><strong>Part-2.</strong> foreign trade is not your problem fundamentally, you trade to get
nice imports, not to export (which fuels your export oligarchs, the enemies
of the nation, their interest is in suppressing domestic wages). Your problem
is drying up of fiscal injections (aka. the &ldquo;governemtn deficit&rdquo;). That&rsquo;s what
is killing you. Not the excess soybeans (grow other crops for domestic sale).</p><p>The Gov Deficit is dollar-for-dollar the non-government sector surplus. You
want that higher, not lower. If your population grows you want the accumulated
debt therefrom to grow with population size, not shrink, just to support
existing prices, even before inflation from interest rate hikes (the interest
rate is the base inflation rate, through term structure of prices faced by
consumers and contracts today.)</p><p>((While old hat MMT, this stuff cannot be repeated often enough!))</p><p>The &ldquo;government debt&rdquo; is the net money supply, i.e., non-government sector tax
credits, by accounting identity, with a growing population is should naturally
rise over time, indefinitely. It always can, it&rsquo;s just scorekeeping (no gold
is at stake, no grandkids held to ransom).</p><h2 id=more-stuff-that-cannot-be-repeated-enough><a class=anchor href=#more-stuff-that-cannot-be-repeated-enough title='Anchor for: More Stuff that Cannot Be Repeated Enough.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>More Stuff that Cannot Be Repeated Enough</h2><p><strong>Part-3.</strong> The &ldquo;rush into gold&rdquo; is not into gold, it is into gold securities
(pieces of paper). No one seriously ships or receives any gold metal${}^\dagger$,
if they all tried together there&rsquo;d be blood at Fort Knox.</p><p>${}^\dagger$ except a few with metallic yellow colour fetishes. The gold
prices always reverts to the mean, and that is a price dictated by government
policy, it cannot be otherwise, since the numeraire is still the &ldquo;$&rdquo;, and the
monopoly issuer of &ldquo;$&rdquo; sets the exchange value of the "" scorepoint, whether
they know it or not. (They do not know it.)</p><hr><p>While Kulinski is guilty of fearstreaming, I think my take on things is even
more terrifying. Kulinski&rsquo;s problem is his solutions (tax the corporations,
tax, tax, tax, export, export, export&mldr;) are nuts, backwards, and obscenely
regressive. Anti-worker. And yet he has no clue about it! He&rsquo;s not trying to
be regressive, quit ethe opposite. Hence why I have more justification to
shake with fear than he does. Peter Thiel will be in New Zealand permanent
before too long ñ°Æñ¶ôÍö∂ñ•êñ¢âñ•£ÍõòÍõ™ us up instead of you guys.</p><p>Luckily Kulinski fearstreaming was shortish, so that&rsquo;s all I have in response
for now. But he and Krystal Ball are forever shooting the working class in
the head with their social influencer, &ldquo;me tax dollar paid for it&rdquo; nonsense.
God (the actual unkowable entity) help us all! Along with Richard Wolff, they&rsquo;re
enabling the fasicists <em>and</em> libertarians at the same time! Quite some feat
for people who like to think of themselves as anti-fascist!</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../108_trademaid>Previous post</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../110_magic_marxism>Next post</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../108_trademaid>Trademaid</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../110_magic_marxism>Magic Marxism</a></td></tr></table></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
