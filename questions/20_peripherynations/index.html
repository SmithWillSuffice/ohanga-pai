I&rsquo;ve been posting to the Blog
recently more regularly, since starting the DougBot Project, and as part of that
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.</p><p>To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the
USA?&mldr; well, c&rsquo;mon, keep up you laggards).
I first wanted to dip into a topic dear to my heart, which is how MMT applies to
poorer nations, so-called &ldquo;on the periphery&rdquo; of international relations. Could it be
MMT does less to help these nations than advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or
bastardized Keynesian orthodoxy equally as deluded about the insights of MMT for
weaker nations as they are about decent small nations like New Zealand?</p><p>The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De Conti (2017),
<a href=https://www.braziliankeynesianreview.org/BKR/article/download/115/90 target=_blank>Modern Money Theory: a criticism from the periphery</a>
.</p><h2 id=they-still-arent-stating-mmt-correctly><a class=anchor href=#they-still-arent-stating-mmt-correctly title='Anchor for: They Still Aren&rsquo;t Stating MMT Correctly.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>They Still Aren&rsquo;t Stating MMT Correctly</h2><p>Before they get around to their supposed critique of &ldquo;MMT&rdquo;, Vergnhanini & De Conti
give a pretty good summary of MMT ideas, however, they fail at the last hurdle, and it is
not a trivial failure. The trouble being it is central to their (false) arguments
&ldquo;against MMT&rdquo;.</p><p>The weak chink they point to is Randall Wray&rsquo;s admission that sometimes international
markets might force a nation to purchase goods for sale in a foreign currency. This
would be <em>only</em> when the weaker nation <em>needs</em> critical imports that it cannot source
domestically or purchase in their own currency.</p><p>However, to argue <em>on common ground</em> we have to accept the MMT Base case, otherwise
the authors are being disingenuous. The base case is:</p><ol><li>The supposedly &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; nation is running a fiat currency on a floating exchange rate,
no peg, no fixed rate policy.</li><li>They are maintaining ZIRP &mdash; so any central bank bond issue is zero interest. For
purposes of running the payments layer only, interbank clearing. (Or not, the MMT
base case is really that currency issuers never need to offer bonds for sale, private
banks can be permitted to operate term deposits for customers).</li><li>The weaker nation runs a Job Guarantee, which supports a base wage floor,
permanent full employment for anyone wishing to work for the tax credits.</li></ol><p>We, they, cannot criticize &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; if they are not considering both ZIRP <em>and</em> the
Job Guarantee.</p><p>What this means is that the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; pointed to by Wray is false. It occurs in the
present day real world because the nations in the global south are not running Job
guarantee policy, thy ar instead forcing the poor, the unemployed, to pay the price for
getting the imports in the foreign currency.</p><p>With this all stated, we can see the first mischaracterization by of &ldquo;MMT&rdquo;, they write,</p><blockquote><p><span style=color:grey>&ldquo;The MMT recognizes that if the country is forced to
international indebtedness because it is obliged to issue debt in a foreign currency
or because it needs goods or services that are not available in
exchange for the domestic currency, then it would be subjected to constraints of
international markets (Wray, 2014a)."</span></p></blockquote><p>This &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; is an opinion and analysis of an MMT economist (Randy Wray) about
a putative global south nation that is <em>not running an MMT <strong>Base Case</strong> system</em>.
However, they probably still have an MMT system. The lack of following the
Base Case matters.
Why? It is because under a full MMT Base Case no nation is obliged to issue
foreign debt. Private citizens and corporation might want to, might do so, but the
government does not. They can pay all debts in their own currency and have no need
to borrow a foreign currency.</p><p>If &ldquo;international markets&rdquo; are obliging the <em>government</em> of the weak nation to issue
foreign debt this is <em>not</em> an MMT Base Case, it would be called neocolonialism or
economic warfare.</p><p>The MMT Base Case has to be adjusted, as Wray does so, in the event of international
warfare.</p><p>If the international markets, specifically the FOREX desks, refuse to exchange the global
south nation&rsquo;s currency for euro or USD, guess who is at fault?</p><p>It is not MMT or the global south nation at fault, it is the foreign empires.<br>Provided the global south nation are driving domestic demand for their currency via
taxation, their currency s always worth real value, specifically whatever that
nation&rsquo;s people can produce for a unit tax credit worth of their labour and industry.</p><p>The FOREX rate for that weak nation is thus never zero. It is zero only if imperial
nations force it to be zero by economic and political warfare. No nation should
accept this, and we have something called the Untied Nations to at least mildly
action against such imperialism.</p><p>It is something else too if that waker nation is utterly corrupt and has no
functioning legal system. In that case it&rsquo;s currency is of highly indeterminate
value, but it is still never zero, so can still be exchanged. Which means they can
still pay for imports.</p><p>They might not get many imports, but that&rsquo;s the real price they pay for corruption
and lack of rule of law, or rule of fair law.</p><p>If one sets up a so-called &ldquo;periphery nation&rdquo; that is corrupt as hell to start with,
then that&rsquo;s not a far criticism of MMT. It is a criticism of that nation&rsquo;s politics.
MMT still applies if their government want it to apply. They can have as much
prosperity as their domestic production allows.</p><p>What that means is optimising their real terms of trade.</p><p>They only condition when the weaker nation cannot optimize it&rsquo;s terms of trade
(sacrifice some desired domestic output to get critical imports) is when they are
suffering from out-right economic warfare, like Iran or Cuba.</p><p>Incidentally, what nation has the lowest exchange rate against the USD? It is Iran.
But they have a fair enough justice system. They are a good example of how political
decision in Washington effect trade effects upon exchange rates. Yet their people are
not suffering terribly badly. There average wage still buys a lot of stuff.
That is the thing about a fiat currency. When apples cost say 20,000 tax credits per<br>kilogram, but your wage is 50,000,000 tax credits a month, you might be grumpy, but
you are probably not starving.</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-TODO: data-lang=TODO:></code></pre><p><a href=../100_why_does_it_matter>Next chapter (Why Does it all Matter?)</a><br><a href=../12_pension_funds>Previous chapter (Pension Funds)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
