I&rsquo;ve been posting to the Blog
recently more regularly, since starting the
<a href=https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader target=_blank>DougBot Project</a>
, and as part of that
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.</p><p>To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the
USA?&mldr; well, c&rsquo;mon, keep up you laggards).
I first wanted to dip into a topic dear to my heart, which is how MMT applies to
poorer nations, so-called &ldquo;on the periphery&rdquo; of international relations. Could it be
MMT does less to help these nations than advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or
bastardized Keynesian orthodoxy equally as deluded about the insights of MMT for
weaker nations as they are about decent small nations like New Zealand?</p><p>The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De Conti (2017),

give a pretty good summary of MMT ideas, however, they fail at the last hurdle, and it is
not a trivial failure. The trouble being it is central to their (false) arguments
&ldquo;against MMT&rdquo;.</p><p>The weak chink they point to is Randall Wray&rsquo;s admission that sometimes international
markets might force a nation to purchase goods for sale in a foreign currency. This
would be <em>only</em> when the weaker nation <em>needs</em> critical imports that it cannot source
domestically or purchase in their own currency.</p><p>However, to argue <em>on common ground</em> we have to accept the MMT Base Case, otherwise
the authors are being disingenuous. The base case is:</p><ol><li>The (supposedly &ldquo;weaker&rdquo;) nation is running a fiat currency on a floating exchange rate, no peg, no fixed rate policy.</li><li>They are maintaining ZIRP &mdash; so any central bank bond issue is zero interest, for
purposes of running the payments layer only, interbank clearing. (Or not, the MMT
base case is really that currency issuers never need to offer bonds for sale, private
banks can be permitted to operate term deposits for customers).</li><li>The nation runs a Job Guarantee, which supports a base wage floor,
permanent full employment for anyone wishing to work for the tax credits.</li><li>Non-convertible currency.</li></ol><p>We, they, you, cannot criticize &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; if we are not considering all of: ZIRP,
a fiat float, tax-driven, <em>and</em> the Job Guarantee.</p><p>What this means is that the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; pointed to by Wray is false <em>for the MMT Base
Case</em>. It occurs in the present day real world because the nations in the global
south are not running job guarantee policy, they are instead forcing the poor, the
unemployed, to pay the price for getting the imports in the foreign currency.</p><p>With this all stated, we can see the first mischaracterization by
Vergnhanini & De Conti of &ldquo;MMT&rdquo;, they write,</p><blockquote><p><span style=color:grey>&ldquo;The [sic.] MMT recognizes that if the country is forced
to [sic.] international indebtedness because it is obliged to issue debt in a foreign
currency or because it needs goods or services that are not available in
exchange for the domestic currency, then it would be subjected to constraints of
international markets (Wray, 2014a)."</span></p></blockquote><p>This &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; is an opinion and analysis of an MMT economist (Randy Wray) about
a putative global south nation that is <em>not running an MMT <strong>Base Case</strong> system</em>.
However, they probably still have an MMT system. The lack of following the
Base Case matters.
Why? It is because under a full MMT Base Case no nation is obliged to issue
foreign debt. Private citizens and corporations might want to, might do so, but the
government does not. They can pay all debts in their own currency and have no need
to borrow a foreign currency.</p><p>If &ldquo;international markets&rdquo; are obliging the <em>government</em> of the weak nation to issue
foreign debt this is <em>not</em> an MMT Base Case, it would be called neocolonialism or
economic warfare.</p><p>The MMT Base Case has to be adjusted, as Wray does so, in the event of such international
warfare.</p><p>If the international markets, specifically the FOREX desks, refuse to exchange the
global south nation&rsquo;s currency for euro or USD, guess who is at fault? Who sparked this
economic war?</p><p>It is not MMT or the global south nation at fault, it is the foreign empires.<br>Provided the global south nation are driving domestic demand for their currency via
taxation, their currency is always worth real value, specifically whatever that
nation&rsquo;s people can produce for a unit tax credit worth of their labour and industry.</p><p>The FOREX rate for that weak nation is thus never zero. It is zero only if imperial
nations force it to be zero by economic and political warfare. No nation should
accept this, and we have something called the United Nations to at least mildly
act against such imperialism.</p><p>It is something else too if that weaker nation is utterly corrupt and has no
functioning legal system. In that case it&rsquo;s currency is of highly indeterminate
value, but it is still never zero, so can still be exchanged. Which means they can
still pay for imports.</p><p>They might not get many imports, but that&rsquo;s the real price they pay for corruption
and lack of rule of law, or rule of fair law.</p><p>If one sets up a so-called &ldquo;periphery nation&rdquo; that is corrupt as hell to start with,
then that&rsquo;s not a fair criticism of MMT. It is a criticism of that nation&rsquo;s politics.
MMT still applies if their government want it to apply. They can have as much
prosperity as their domestic production allows.</p><p>What that means is optimising their real terms of trade.</p><p>The only condition when the weaker nation cannot optimize it&rsquo;s terms of trade
(sacrifice some desired domestic output to get critical imports) is when they are
suffering from out-right economic warfare, like Iran or Cuba.</p><p>Incidentally, what nation has the lowest exchange rate against the USD? It is Iran.
But they have a fair enough justice system. They are a good example of how political
decision in Washington exerts trade effects upon exchange rates. Yet their people are
not suffering terribly badly. Their average wage still buys a lot of stuff.
That is the thing about a fiat currency. When apples cost say 20,000 tax credits per
kilogram, but your wage is 50,000,000 tax credits a month, you might be grumpy, but
you are probably not starving.</p><h3 id=the-mmt-base-case-is-where-to-start><a class=anchor href=#the-mmt-base-case-is-where-to-start title='Anchor for: The MMT Base Case is Where to Start.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The MMT Base Case is Where to Start</h3><p>All such issues of superimperialism accounted for and acknowledged, what
is the best policy for the weaker nation to pursue?</p><p>In all cases, without exception, it is the MMT Base Case.</p><p>The fact the MMT Base Case analysis fails to apply for a weak, corrupt, periphery
nation held under oppression of imperialism, is not an argument against MMT, and nor
is it an argument something other than MMT should be their monetary system. In all
cases they are better off employing MMT operations to run full domestic employment.
They gain <em>nothing</em> in real terms by unemploying their workers.</p><p>If their workers are being exploited to produce military munitions for foreigners,
then MMT is not the problem, the political economic warfare is the problem.</p><p>Now I wrote this little section before reading part-3 of Vergnhanini and
De Conti&rsquo;s paper. I did this because I expected, or hoped, to be surprised that
they would refute this assertion that regardless of the nation&rsquo;s standing on the
international stage, they are <em>still</em> better off adopting MMT Base Case policy. I was
prepared to be awed by any counter-argument to this assertion.</p><h2 id=the-general-criticisms><a class=anchor href=#the-general-criticisms title='Anchor for: The &ldquo;General&rdquo; Criticisms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The &ldquo;General&rdquo; Criticisms</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s first see if the general criticisms raised by Vergnhanini &
De Conti are of any merit (and if not, why are they repeating them?).</p><ol><li><strong>Origin of Money</strong> &mdash; The criticism is that MMT places too much emphasis on
tax-driven demand. The critics say MMT ignores the secondary functions of: means of
payment, store of value, and &ldquo;unit of account&rdquo;. The third of these is a stupid
critique, since the tax-driven chartal currency <em>is</em> the unit of account, so
Vergnhanini and
De Conti are off to a poor start, not giving MMT its due. The first two
functions are fully recognized by MMT. Why does a currency attain a store of value
functional and means of payment function? It&rsquo;s because there is demand. What drives
that demand is the point in question. MMT does not deny methods <em>other</em> than taxes can
drive demand, see Wray&rsquo;s latest readable book
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61723716-making-money-work-for-us target=_blank>“Making Money Work for Us”</a>
and the earlier <a href>“Modern Money Primer”</a>
and <a href=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110016/1/770835929.pdf target=_blank>“Modern Money Theory 101: A reply to critics”</a>
.</li><li><strong>Consolidated Government Framework</strong> &mdash; MMT analysis often consolidates Central
Bank and Treasury, even while acknowledging they have different functions and
mandates. Marc Lavoie this time, and Palley (again) are called upon as the critics.
This is again a completely stupid critique. Firstly, MMT recognizes the separation of
functions (monetary and fiscal policy). But consolidating governments is the correct
framework for the most basic sectoral balances. For when Treasury makes payments to the
central bank, it is the left pocket of government paying the right pocket. Lavoie is
the fictionalizer here. If Treasury defaults on payments due to the CB it&rsquo;d be
entirely pointless, and those liabilities have zero real economic consequence
other than exerting some false psychology effects (policy insanity). It is the false
psychology of policy makers that is at fault here, not MMT. Lavoie is better to start
teaching the reality, which is that for many purposes it&rsquo;s a good idea to consolidate
government in an analysis. If you <em>think</em> Parliament has to constrain spending because
it &ldquo;owes&rdquo; the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; Central Bank scorepoints, <em>you</em> are the problem, not MMT.</li><li><strong>Inflation and Interest Rates Explanation</strong> &mdash; MMT is &ldquo;lacking a rigorous
explanation&rdquo; says Palley. This is truly Orwellian. Total bollocks. Only MMT <em>has</em> an
explanation of the general price level, which implies also rate of change, i.e.,
inflation. The general framework can be found in Mosler and Forstater,
<a href=http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-General-Analytical-Framework.pdf target=_blank>“A general framework for the analysis of currencies and commodities”</a>
. For
the interest rate the framework is found in another Mosler and Forstater paper, <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4228167 target=_blank>“The Natural Rate of Interest is Zero”</a>
.
The &ldquo;L shaped&rdquo; inflation (Phillips) curve described by MMT is not seen in the real
world not because MMT is a flawed framework, but because no government runs a Job
Guarantee labour buffer. If they did, by definition the Phillips curve would flatten,
it would not even be visibly L-shaped. It would be &lsquo;&mdash;&rsquo; shaped. But we will not know
this empirically
until some government runs a Job Guarantee policy. However, the theory is solid, and <a href=http://www.billmitchell.org/publications/journals/J74_2010.pdf target=_blank>Bill Mitchell, here: “Full Employment Abandoned: shifting sands and policy failures”</a>
has plenty of modelling
to show the basic idea of flattening the Phillips curve.</li><li><strong>ZIRP Effects</strong> &mdash; Tom Palley again, asserts ZIRP would lead to asset price
inflation. This is wrong, or would need to be supported by lax bank credit collateral
requirements and/or government fiscal injections supporting asset prices. Both
effects could occur, and do occur. But MMT is not at fault here. How does a monetary
authority prevent asset price inflations caused by ZIRP? Firstly, ZIRP does not cause
anything, since the natural rate is zero. It therefore must be the regulatory policy
governing bank lending and collateral that supports rising asset prices. Moreover, in
the MMT Base Case a rise in interest rates will inject currency into the economy
whenever the government Treasury issue to GDP ratio is above about 50%, which is pretty
typical, in this case higher interest rates are more free money but only to people
who already have money. If this likely to push up asset prices? Over time youbetcha.
Short run it may drive savings into bonds rather than other assets, but once the
interest payments flow the asset prices will pick up. The opposite to how fools like
Palley see things.<br>     MMT suggests the role of government should be to
better regulate banks, not use interest rates. Palley cannot ever deny this is true,
unless it is tried and does not work. But of course regulating banks would work, if
enforced, if not corrupted. So is the &ldquo;critique&rdquo; of MMT that in the real world
governments are corrupt? That&rsquo;d be highly disingenuous, since it is not a critique of
MMT, it&rsquo;d be a critique of certain governments. This is, to their credit,
acknowledged
by Vergnhanini and De Conti, so this one of Palley&rsquo;s is recognized as not a
valid critique of MMT.</li><li><strong>Floating Exchange Rate</strong> &mdash; This critique is the more <em>apropo</em> for Vergnhanini &
De Conti&rsquo;s paper. Tom Palley again is resuscitated from the vampire crypt to
attack MMT, he claims floating exchange rates are insufficient to &ldquo;insulate&rdquo; a small
open economy from pass-through effects of inflation. This attack misses the mark by a
country mile, because the purpose of MMT informed policy for a small open economy is
not price stability, it is full employment. Price stability can be abandoned
indefinitely. Few critics of MMT understand this, and many MMT advocates also fail to
appreciate the purpose of price stability. Price stability is a political goal, not
an economic goal. The economic goal is a gradual improvement in the <em>real wage</em>, and
that can occur with any inflation level that is tolerated by political psychology.
The limits here are entirely political, not monetary, not real resources.
Since you will not see this in most standard MMT literature, I will reference the
analysis of the Weimar hyperinflation by
<a href=https://gimms.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Weimar-Republic-Hyperinflation-through-a-Modern-Monetary-Theory-Lens.pdf target=_blank>Armstrong and Mosler</a>
. It should suffice.</li></ol><p>It you take issue with any of these defences of MMT or the references let me know after
<a href=https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/ target=_blank>donating here</a>
so I can justify the time responding
to your argument.</p><h3 id=fixed-exchange-rate-brainworms><a class=anchor href=#fixed-exchange-rate-brainworms title='Anchor for: Fixed Exchange Rate Brainworms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Fixed Exchange Rate Brainworms</h3><p>The exchange rate criticism is a common one coming from post-Keynesians, who are
slightly dysfunctional parents to the MMT off-spring prodigy. Paul Davidson is a
prominent PK economist who advocates for Kenyes&rsquo; Bancor program of fixed exchange rates.</p><p>What the PK&rsquo;ers have is a mental disease, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of
the state currency purpose, which is to float supply in order to stabilize price.
I&rsquo;ll try to give a basic synopsis of the problem with fixed exchange rate policy, for
which concrete examples can be found all over the world, the Hong Kong currency board
problems (due to fixed exchange rate control and US$\$$ fiscal tightening), and the
Russian ruble late 1990&rsquo;s deterioration (due to fixed exchange rates and loss of tax
enforcement power), are two illustrative examples, but I will only give the abstract
case.</p><p>We start off with any normal state currency. A fixed exchange rate is desired, as is
full employment. It is not too violent a loss of abstraction to consider this
abstract country, say Peekayland, pegs to the US dollar (USD), thus offer convertibility
at their central bank from their currency the PKD to USD.</p><p>Holder of marginal PKD (no use for them) have only three options,</p><ol><li>Hold PKD in a deposit account.</li><li>Buy PKD Treasuries,, we&rsquo;ll cal these PKGB.</li><li>Swap PKD for USD at their central bank.</li></ol><p>Options 2 and 3 are competing. But could be initially &ldquo;in equilibrium&rdquo; (there is
indifference between 2 and 3).</p><p>But then something happens, it could be one critical import their economy needs (this&rsquo;d
usually be energy or grain) runs short and their import price goes up, or maybe the
USD rate is hiked, or Peekayland suffers some on-going chronic labour disruptions or
other supply shock. Note (for later) this disturbance need not be too big.</p><p>This creates enormous pressure for the holder of marginal ruble to go for option 3,
since why would they not? The option is available and they know the intrinsic value of
the PKD, which is backed by the industrial output of Peekayland&rsquo;s labour, is threatened.
The run &lsquo;out of&rsquo; the PKD &lsquo;into&rsquo; USD places downward pressure on the Peekayland exchange
rate. But wait! They&rsquo;re operating a fixed rate policy. The response of the Peekayland
central bank, the PCB, must be to raise the interest rate on PKD bonds, to attract
back some PKD, so they do not run out of USD reserves.</p><p>Note the PCB and their Parliament + Treasury can create PKD by fiat (Parliament
authorize, Treasury keeps books and advises, PCB makes payments), so solvency is
not a problem. But they are worried about price inflation too, so need to restrict
supply of PKD appropriately, through taxation or spending adjustments.</p><p>The issuance of more PKGB (Peekay Government Bonds) at the higher rate adds to their
government deficit, all other things equal. If this scenario is sustained for a while
this becomes a huge net injection of PKD into the Peekayland economy, creating
inflationary pressures (all demand for zero supply). Typically some inflation will
materialize, leading the PCB to hike rates further to draw in some of the excess
purchasing power into PKGB.</p><p>This can snow-ball, as the interest payments on the PKGB inject more PDK into the
top-end of the economy it can push up asset prices, but also &ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo; to even
more consumer spending, but then also more demand for USD, which the PCB cannot create
legally, so the reserves get drained, leading to an even higher PKGB rate, and
so more deficit injection, and so on.</p><p>How does this all get stabilized? Maybe the USD interest rate drops exogenously, or
the USA fiscal policy becomes expansionary, more Americans buying imports generally
and supply the foreign sector (hence Peekayland) with USD. This is chancy, it&rsquo;s not
going to happen by magic wands and wishes. If such exogenous exchange rate
adjustments fail to materialise (and typically they&rsquo;ll not materialize) Peekayland faces
a never-ending upwards pressure on the PKGB interest rate, or the option to run out of
USD and default on their swap obligations.</p><p>In the latter case they&rsquo;ve decided (or been forced) to go off the fixed exchange rate,
they will devalue, or move to a floating exchange rate.</p><p>If not, they could choose the highly regressive option of restricting PKD, impose
austerity. Either by raising taxes drastically (if they were Russian they&rsquo;d be unable
to enforce, so this&rsquo;d not work) or they could cut government spending drastically &mdash;
closing public utilities and maybe cutting pension payments (which ought to have been
guaranteed!) and whatnot.)</p><p>Their other source of exchange rate stabilization would be to export more to the USA,
or to other nations who have currencies convertible to USD or tradeable for USD.
But you again cannot wave magic wands to suddenly boost exports without contracting
the domestic real economy. Exports are a real cost. So this is also austerity by any
other name. They could seek to employ cheap immigrant labour for a time trying to
&ldquo;weather the storm&rdquo; (the immigrants are never the problem, they&rsquo;re your solution,
especially in these fixed exchange rate situations). The exporters could also make
their goods more attractive by cutting the wages they pay to reduce their rices.
Again, austerity. This always results in higher involuntary unemployment.</p><p>There is no non austere solution, I hope you can see.</p><p>The fixed exchange rate has directly undermined their real standard of living in
Peekayland. For sure, the supply shock or small disturbance started this ball
rolling, but they cannot insulate themselves from all possible shocks. It&rsquo;ll happen
sooner or later. We just had major flooding and earthquakes at the same time in New
Zealand. But luckily we&rsquo;ve got a floating exchange rate. Our imports will thus get
relatively dearer, but our economy will be fine. You have to pay in real terms for
natural disasters, no magic since we&rsquo;ve actually not got Gandalf here ensconced at
Hobbiton smoking pipe-weed, sorry to say.</p><p>The tragedy of countries like Peekayland, run by neoclassically trained but maybe
bastard Keynesians, is they will often in the real world choose this second scenario,
even if they&rsquo;re not Russia and <em>could</em> raise taxes. The least powerful political
constituency, the poor, the low waged, take all the bullets, in uncivilized societies.</p><p>You might say, &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t they just devalue the PKD manually themselves?&rdquo;
The answer is fistly, &ldquo;Devalue to what?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no magic formula for obtaining
PKD$\leftrightarrow$USD market stability, they&rsquo;d risk deflation and hence economic
contraction. Secondly, the central bankers who are neoclassical or bastard Keynesian,
tend to think the markets will correct, they tend to always make the exchange rate
devaluation too late, so the damage gets done. We know this because they&rsquo;re the type
suggesting fixed exchange rates in the first place. You&rsquo;d hope less damage occurs
than if no correction was taken, but needless unemployment of Peekaylanders results
all the same &mdash; a decline in the standard of living.</p><p>On an exchange rate float there is no such dynamic. Full employment can <em>always</em> be
maintained in perpetuity. The price paid for the supply shock is a lower exchange
rate, which redistributes imports domestically (who gets to play golf, who has to
show up at the factory). The loss in standard of living is then minimal, because
<em>domestically</em> such a government desiring to protect its people can always (if they
so desire) make the necessary fiscal adjustments to make sure everyone has about the
same amount of &ldquo;golf time&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=FairTradeIssues><a class=anchor href=#FairTradeIssues title='Anchor for: Fair Trade Issues.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Fair Trade Issues</h2><p>Here we are at the critical point where the critique of Vergnhanini &
De Conti coalesces with a similar critique of MMT by friend Steve Keen. The MMT
case is that <em>imports are a <strong>real</strong> benefit, and exports are a <strong>real</strong> cost</em>.
The issue is that some post-Keynesians see this as &ldquo;too simplistic.&rdquo; However, they
ignore the macroeconomics point of MMT, which is based on realism about the Base Case
for Analysis (no imperial despots, floating exchange rates, fiat currency driven by tax
liabilities). Under the Base Case it is a truism that imports are real benefits
and exports are real costs.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve grown used to these sorts of disingenuous or ignorant attacks on MMT.
A beginning MMTer can find them perplexing, but after some maturity you realise it&rsquo;s
the orthodox economists who are simplistic. Their level of comprehension of MMT is
extremely flawed and too simplistic. A case of Moles calling the Owl blind:
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see it because I can&rsquo;t see it, so if you see it you must be going mad.&rdquo;</p><p>For these purposes &mdash; for trade relations &mdash; the MMT Base Case applies pretty well to
New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, maybe the UK, any country trade-friendly with
both the USA and China. (Although the Japanese have not yet figured out their exports
are too high a cost, given their aging population dependency ratio problem.)</p><p>Steve Keen, for his ill part, oftens leaves off the qualifier &ldquo;real&rdquo;, and so false
frames the debate into monetary terms. Certainly, allowing foreigners to accumulate
your currency means they can buy your goods. But MMT would counter that this is no
risk unless governments make it a risk. Goods you produce domestically do not
<em>have</em> to be for sale to foreigners.</p><p>Keen also raises the &ldquo;de-industrialization&rdquo; fear-mongering. But why would being a net
importer mean you <em>have</em> to de-industrialize? It means no such thing. Anything that
can be produced at more expense domestically can be sourced domestically, if that is
desired for strategic reasons. So this is not a fair critique of MMT, because such
strategic resource policies are entirely up to governments to choose. They may choose
right or wrong for their people, regardless of what MMT teaches them. Better to
regard MMT, I say.</p><p>The purpose is to optimize your <strong><em>real</em></strong> terms of trade, not your current account
balances, which for governments are mere accounting records. Any nation may optimize
their real terms of trade. That does not mean all can be net importers, which is an
impossible state, there must be at least one net exporter, by capital account
balances.
That country is still seeking to get as many quality imports it can get for the
minimal amount they can export. Or, at least, that&rsquo;s what they ought to be doing in
trade negotiations. There&rsquo;s no telling for what ignorance will accomplish.</p><p>If you drop the qualifier &ldquo;real&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll misunderstand. The money becomes unimportant
in the case when we&rsquo;re analysing <em>real</em> terms of trade (since there is assumed no imperialism).</p><p>You may, like Steve Keen or Michael Hudson, still get it wrong if you are thinking in
currency terms and <em>fixed exchange rates</em> instead of real terms and floating exchange
rates. The trade risk is never nominal inflation. The risk is running out of real
resources, that is to say, the risk should be thought of in terms of real inflation
(eroding of the purchasing power of the annual wage).</p><p>Under MMT, there are still two major factors that can erode the <em>real</em> wage:</p><ol><li><strong>Rentiers</strong> &mdash; rent extraction to the top One Percent, which is tantamount to stolen
wages from the working class, although MMT generally is taken to subsume Keynes, so you&rsquo;d
be euthanizing your rentiers, would you not? So not much of a risk factor for an MMT
informed government wishing to protect <em>all</em> their people.</li><li><strong>Imperialists</strong> &mdash; a large nation simply refuses to trade with you. MMT is not going
to help here, but nor is any other school of economic thought, since it is a political
problem. So you might as well adhere to MMT policy and at least maximise domestic
non-bullsh*t output.</li></ol><p>Unemployment directly reduces output too, eroding the real wage, but that&rsquo;s not going to
happen in the MMT Base Case, so it is not a risk factor.</p><p>You might include other risks like plagues, droughts, asteroid strikes, war, general
stupidity and educational dumbing down and whatnot. All of which can erode the
real wage potentially.
If you can foresee these, then definitely include them in policy planning to mitigate
the foreseeable erosion of real wages. To <em>implement</em> those policies MMT is only going to be able to help, not hinder, and will help you far better than any other
school of economic thought. (&ldquo;You&rdquo; meaning a commoner, not necessarily you if you&rsquo;re
in the rentier upper class.)</p><p>Under an international imperialist despot (like the USA) of course this simple story
can get twisted. But this is hardly a fault or flaw in MMT. If you do not like
imperialism then failing to adopt an MMT system and policies will not help you, it&rsquo;ll
make things worse.
Remember, <em>any</em> pass-through effects of inflation can be tolerated indefinitely for a
monopoly currency issuer.</p><p>The problem is getting other nations who have things to sell to accept your currency.
If they will not accept your currency then you need to swap on the FOREX market,
which if done on a mass scale risks currency depreciation and pass-through inflation.
However, that inflation can go on forever. There is no limit, provided the domestic
currency is fiat and on a float.</p><p>In severe cases the FOREX market will not even accept your currency, in which case
you have bigger problems than monetary economics. Almost all nations today can
operate a FOREX desk, and should always find takers for their currency if they are
imposing domestic tax liabilities payable only in their unit of account. (The &lsquo;unit
of account&rsquo; being equivalent to the tax credit, which was misunderstood by Palley in
the note above &mdash; the state unit of account need not be the tax credit, but almost
invariably is!)</p><p>Basket case nations like Ecuador (converting to USD) and Argentina (using a dual
currency) and Venezuela (oligarchs looting billions and converting bolivar to USD)
are not cases proving MMT is false, because they&rsquo;re not employing an MMT Base Case
system.</p><p>The better way to understand all this is to understand the purpose of exporting real
goods: the exports pay for the imports. They are a price you pay for keeping
pass-through inflation under control while receiving a few nice imports.</p><p>The way to remove the damaging neoliberal psychological effect of inflation is to
raise domestic production over time. You cannot do this any better than with full
domestic employment, so you will <em>need</em> MMT in both theory and practice.</p><p>It is possible benign rich nations could gift you imports. Or they might lend at zero
interest rate. That&rsquo;d obviate the need for an exchange rate float, but who is ever going
to rely on such a commonwealth? Nice if you can get it.</p><p>What about trade embargoes, like those imposed upon Cuba?</p><p>Even here, Cuba is best advised to run an MMT system. There is no benefit to doing
otherwise. Why unemploy your workers just because some other nation is not trading
with you? It&rsquo;d be like punishing your dog for stepping in your neighbours doodoo
while he was warding off an intruder.</p><p><a href=../21_powerplays>Next chapter (Punked Plutocrat Power Plays)</a><br><a href=../12_pension_funds>Previous chapter (Pension Funds)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
