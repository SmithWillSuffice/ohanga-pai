I&rsquo;ve been posting to the Blog
recently more regularly, since starting the DougBot Project, and as part of that
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.</p><p>To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the
USA?&mldr; well, c&rsquo;mon, keep up you laggards).
I first wanted to dip into a topic dear to my heart, which is how MMT applies to
poorer nations, so-called &ldquo;on the periphery&rdquo; of international relations. Could it be
MMT does less to help these nations than advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or
bastardized Keynesian orthodoxy equally as deluded about the insights of MMT for
weaker nations as they are about decent small nations like New Zealand?</p><p>The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De Conti (2017),
<a href=https://www.braziliankeynesianreview.org/BKR/article/download/115/90 target=_blank>Modern Money Theory: a criticism from the periphery</a>
.</p><p>If you want to skip the preliminary defences of MMT, which reply to standard criticism, and go staright to the trade issues, then <a href=#FairTradeIssues>click here to the Trade Issues</a>

give a pretty good summary of MMT ideas, however, they fail at the last hurdle, and it is
not a trivial failure. The trouble being it is central to their (false) arguments
&ldquo;against MMT&rdquo;.</p><p>The weak chink they point to is Randall Wray&rsquo;s admission that sometimes international
markets might force a nation to purchase goods for sale in a foreign currency. This
would be <em>only</em> when the weaker nation <em>needs</em> critical imports that it cannot source
domestically or purchase in their own currency.</p><p>However, to argue <em>on common ground</em> we have to accept the MMT Base case, otherwise
the authors are being disingenuous. The base case is:</p><ol><li>The supposedly &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; nation is running a fiat currency on a floating exchange rate,
no peg, no fixed rate policy.</li><li>They are maintaining ZIRP &mdash; so any central bank bond issue is zero interest. For
purposes of running the payments layer only, interbank clearing. (Or not, the MMT
base case is really that currency issuers never need to offer bonds for sale, private
banks can be permitted to operate term deposits for customers).</li><li>The weaker nation runs a Job Guarantee, which supports a base wage floor,
permanent full employment for anyone wishing to work for the tax credits.</li></ol><p>We, they, cannot criticize &ldquo;MMT&rdquo; if they are not considering both ZIRP <em>and</em> the
Job Guarantee.</p><p>What this means is that the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; pointed to by Wray is false. It occurs in the
present day real world because the nations in the global south are not running Job
guarantee policy, thy ar instead forcing the poor, the unemployed, to pay the price for
getting the imports in the foreign currency.</p><p>With this all stated, we can see the first mischaracterization by of &ldquo;MMT&rdquo;, they write,</p><blockquote><p><span style=color:grey>&ldquo;The MMT recognizes that if the country is forced to
international indebtedness because it is obliged to issue debt in a foreign currency
or because it needs goods or services that are not available in
exchange for the domestic currency, then it would be subjected to constraints of
international markets (Wray, 2014a)."</span></p></blockquote><p>This &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; is an opinion and analysis of an MMT economist (Randy Wray) about
a putative global south nation that is <em>not running an MMT <strong>Base Case</strong> system</em>.
However, they probably still have an MMT system. The lack of following the
Base Case matters.
Why? It is because under a full MMT Base Case no nation is obliged to issue
foreign debt. Private citizens and corporation might want to, might do so, but the
government does not. They can pay all debts in their own currency and have no need
to borrow a foreign currency.</p><p>If &ldquo;international markets&rdquo; are obliging the <em>government</em> of the weak nation to issue
foreign debt this is <em>not</em> an MMT Base Case, it would be called neocolonialism or
economic warfare.</p><p>The MMT Base Case has to be adjusted, as Wray does so, in the event of international
warfare.</p><p>If the international markets, specifically the FOREX desks, refuse to exchange the global
south nation&rsquo;s currency for euro or USD, guess who is at fault?</p><p>It is not MMT or the global south nation at fault, it is the foreign empires.<br>Provided the global south nation are driving domestic demand for their currency via
taxation, their currency is always worth real value, specifically whatever that
nation&rsquo;s people can produce for a unit tax credit worth of their labour and industry.</p><p>The FOREX rate for that weak nation is thus never zero. It is zero only if imperial
nations force it to be zero by economic and political warfare. No nation should
accept this, and we have something called the United Nations to at least mildly
action against such imperialism.</p><p>It is something else too if that weaker nation is utterly corrupt and has no
functioning legal system. In that case it&rsquo;s currency is of highly indeterminate
value, but it is still never zero, so can still be exchanged. Which means they can
still pay for imports.</p><p>They might not get many imports, but that&rsquo;s the real price they pay for corruption
and lack of rule of law, or rule of fair law.</p><p>If one sets up a so-called &ldquo;periphery nation&rdquo; that is corrupt as hell to start with,
then that&rsquo;s not a far criticism of MMT. It is a criticism of that nation&rsquo;s politics.
MMT still applies if their government want it to apply. They can have as much
prosperity as their domestic production allows.</p><p>What that means is optimising their real terms of trade.</p><p>The only condition when the weaker nation cannot optimize it&rsquo;s terms of trade
(sacrifice some desired domestic output to get critical imports) is when they are
suffering from out-right economic warfare, like Iran or Cuba.</p><p>Incidentally, what nation has the lowest exchange rate against the USD? It is Iran.
But they have a fair enough justice system. They are a good example of how political
decision in Washington effect trade effects upon exchange rates. Yet their people are
not suffering terribly badly. There average wage still buys a lot of stuff.
That is the thing about a fiat currency. When apples cost say 20,000 tax credits per
kilogram, but your wage is 50,000,000 tax credits a month, you might be grumpy, but
you are probably not starving.</p><h3 id=the-mmt-base-case-is-where-to-start><a class=anchor href=#the-mmt-base-case-is-where-to-start title='Anchor for: The MMT Base Case is Where to Start.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The MMT Base Case is Where to Start</h3><p>However, all such issue of superimperialism accounted for and acknowledged, what
is the best policy for the weaker nation to pursue?</p><p>In all cases, without exception, it is the MMT Base Case.</p><p>The fact the MMT Base Case analysis fails to apply for a weak, corrupt, periphery
nation held under oppression of imperialism, is not an argument against MMT, and nor
is it an argument something other than MMT should be their monetary system. In all
cases they are better off employing MMT operations to run full domestic employment.
They gain <em>nothing</em> in real terms by unemploying their workers.</p><p>If their workers are being exploited to produce military munitions for foreigners,
then MMT is not the problem, the political economic warfare is the problem.</p><p>Now I wrote this little section before reading part-3 of Vergnhanini and
De Conti&rsquo;s paper. I did this because I expected, or hoped, to be surprised that
they would refute this assertion that regardless of the nation&rsquo;s standing on the
international stage, they are <em>still</em> better off adopting MMT Base Case policy. I was
prepared to be awed by any counter-argument to this assertion.</p><h2 id=the-general-criticisms><a class=anchor href=#the-general-criticisms title='Anchor for: The &ldquo;General&rdquo; Criticisms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The &ldquo;General&rdquo; Criticisms</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s first see if the general criticism raised by Vergnhanini and
De Conti are of any merit (and if not, why are they repeating them?).</p><ol><li><strong>Origin of Money</strong> the criticism is that MMT places too much emphasis on
tax-driven demand. The critics say MMT ignores the secondary functions of: means of
payment, store of value, and &ldquo;unit of account&rdquo;. the third of these is a stupid
critique, since the tax-driven chartal currency <em>is</em> the unit of account, so
Vergnhanini and
De Conti are off to a poor start, not giving MMT its due. However, the first two
functions are fully recognized by MMT. Why does a currency attain a store of value
functional and means of payment function? It&rsquo;s because there is demand. What drives
that demand is the point in question. MMT does not deny methods <em>other</em> than taxes can
drive demand, see Wray&rsquo;s latest readable book
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61723716-making-money-work-for-us target=_blank>“Making Money Work for Us”</a>
and the earlier <a href>“Modern Money Primer”</a>
and <a href=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110016/1/770835929.pdf target=_blank>“Modern Money Theory 101: A reply to critics”</a>
.</li><li><strong>Consolidated Government Framework</strong> MMT analysis often consolidates central
bank and treasury, even while acknowledging they have different functions and
mandates. Marc Lavoie this time, and Palley (again) are called upon as the critics.
This is again a completely stupid critique. Firstly, MMT recognizes the separation of
functions (monetary and fiscal policy). But consolidating governmetns is the correct
framework for the most basic sectoral balances. For when Treasury makes the central
bank payments, it is the left pocket of government paying the right pocket. Lavoie is
the fictionalizer here. If Treasury defaults on payments due to the CB it&rsquo;d be
entirely pointless, and those liabilities have zero real economic consequences
other than exerting some false psychology. It is the false psychology of policy
makers that is at fault here, not MMT. Lavoie is better to start teaching the
reality, which is that for many purposes it&rsquo;s a good idea to consolidate government
in an analysis.</li><li><strong>Inflation and Interest Rates Explanation</strong> MMT is &ldquo;lacking a rigorous
explanation&rdquo; says Palley. This is bollocks. Only MMT has an explanation of the
general price level, which implies also rate of change, i.e., inflation. The general
framework can be found in Mosler and Forstater,
<a href=http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-General-Analytical-Framework.pdf target=_blank>“A general framework for the analysis of currencies and commodities”</a>
. For
the interest rate the framework is found in another Mosler and Forstater paper, <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4228167 target=_blank>“The Natural Rate of Interest is Zero”</a>
.
The &ldquo;L shaped&rdquo; inflation (Phillips) curve described by MMT is not seen in the real
world not because MMT is a falwed framework, but because no government runs a Job
Guarantee labour buffer. If they did, by definition the Phillips curve would flatten,
it would not even be visibly L-shaped. it would be $-$ shaped. But we will not know
this empirically
until some government runs a Job Guarantee policy. However, the theory is solid, and <a href=http://www.billmitchell.org/publications/journals/J74_2010.pdf target=_blank>Bill Mitchell, here: “Full Employment Abandoned: shifting sands and policy failures”</a>
has plenty of modelling
to show the basic idea of flattening the Phillips curve.</li><li><strong>ZIRP Effects</strong> Tom Palley against asserts ZIRP would lead to asset price
inflation. This is wrong, or would need to be supported by lax bank credit collateral
requirements and/or government fiscal injections supporting asset prices. Both
effects could occur, and do occur. But MMT is not at fault here. How does a monetary
authority prevent asset price inflations caused by ZIRP? Firstly, ZIRP does not cause
anything, since the natural rate is zero. It therefore must be the regulatory policy
government bank lending and collateral that supports rising asst prices. MMT suggests
the role of government should be to better regulate banks, not use interest rates.
Palley cannot ever deny this is true, unless sit is tried and does not work. But of
course regulating banks would work, if enforced, if not corrupted. So is the
&ldquo;critique&rdquo; of MMT that in the real world governments are corrupt? That&rsquo;d be highly
disingenuous, since it is not a critique of MMT, it&rsquo;d be a critique of certain
governments. This is, to their credit, acknowledged
by Vergnhanini and De Conti, so is recognized as not a valid critique of MMT.</li><li><strong>Floating Exchange Rate</strong> This critique is the more <em>apropo</em> for Vergnhanini and
De Conti&rsquo;s paper. Tom Palley again is resuscitated from the vampire crypt to
attack MMT, he claims floating exchange rates are insufficient to &ldquo;insulate&rdquo; a small
open economy from pass-through effects of inflation. this attack misses the mark by a
country mile, because the purpose of MMT informed policy for a small open economy is
not price stability, it is full employment. Price stability can be abandoned
indefinitely. Few critics of MMT understand this, and many MMT advocates also fail to
appreciate the purpose of price stability. Price stability is a political goal, not
an economic goal. The economic goal is a gradual improvement in the <em>real wage</em>, and
that can occur with any inflation level that is tolerated by political psychology.
The limits here are entirely political, not monetary, not real resources.
Since you will not see this in most standard MMT literature, I will reference the
analysis of the Weimar hyperinflation by
<a href=https://gimms.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Weimar-Republic-Hyperinflation-through-a-Modern-Monetary-Theory-Lens.pdf target=_blank>Armstrong and Mosler</a>
. It should suffice,</li></ol><p>It you take issue with any of these defences of MMT or the references let me know after
<a href=https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/ target=_blank>donating here</a>
so I can justify the time responding
to your argument.</p><h2 id=FairTradeIssues><a class=anchor href=#FairTradeIssues title='Anchor for: Fair Trade Issues.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Fair Trade Issues</h2><p>Here we are at the critical point where the critique of Vergnhanini and
De Conti coalesces with a similar critique of MMT by friend Steve Keen. The MMT
case is that <strong><em>imports are a real benefit, and exports are a real cost</em></strong>. The issue
is that some post-Keynesians see this is &ldquo;too simplistic&rdquo;. However, they ignore the
macroeconomics point of MMT, which is based on realism about the Base Case for
Analysis (no imperial despots, floating exchange rate,s fiat currency). Under the
Base Case it is a truism that imports are real benefits and exports are rel costs.</p><p>Steve Keen, for his ill part, oftens leaves off the qualifier real&rdquo;, and so false frames the debate into monetary terms. Certainly, allowing foreigners to accumulate your currency means they can buy your goods. But MMT would counter that this is no risk unless governments make it a risk. Goods you produce domestically do not <em>have(</em> to be for sale to foreigners.</p><p>Keen also raises the &ldquo;de-industrialization&rdquo; fear-mongering. But why would being a net importer mean you <em>have</em> to de-industrialize? It means no such thing. Anything that can be produced at more expense domestically can be sourced domestically, if that is desired for strategic reasons. So this is not a fair critique of MMT, because such strategic resource policies are entirely up to governments to choose. They may choose right or wrong for their people, regardless of what MMT teaches them. Better to regard MMT, I say.</p><p>The purpose is to optimize your <strong><em>real</em></strong> terms of trade, not your current account balances, which for governments are mere accounting records. Any nation may optimize their real terms of trade. That does not mean all can be net importers, which is an impossible state, there must be at least one net exporter, by capital account balances.
That country is still seeking to get as many quality imports it can get for the minimal amount they can export. Or, at least, that&rsquo;s what they ought to be doing in trade negotiations. There&rsquo;s no telling for what ignorance will accomplish.</p><p>If you drop the qualifier &ldquo;real&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll misunderstand. The money becomes unimportant
in this case (since there is assumed no imperialism).</p><p>Under an international imperialist despot (like the USA) of course this simple story
can get twisted,. But this is hardly a fault or flaw in MMT. If you do not like
imperialism then failing to adopt an MMT system and policies will not help you, it&rsquo;ll
make things worse.
Remember, <em>any</em> pass-through effects of inflation can be tolerated indefinitely for a
monopoly currency issuer.</p><p>The problem is getting other nations who have things to sell to accept your currency.
If they will not accept your currency than you need to swap on the FOREX market,
which if done on a mass scale risks currency depreciation and pass-through inflation.
However, that inflation can go on forever. There is no limit, provided the domestic
currency is fiat and on a float.</p><p>The better way to understand it is to understand the purpose of exporting real
goods: the exports pay for the imports. They are a price you pay for keeping
pass-through inflation under control.</p><p>The way to remove the psychological inflation effects is to raise domestic production
over time. You cannot do this any better than with full domestic employment, so you
will <em>need</em> MMT.</p><p>It is possible benign rich nations could gift you imports. Or they might lend at zero
interest rate. That&rsquo;d obviate the need for an exchange rate float, but who is ever going
to rely on such a commonwealth? Nice if you can get it.</p><p>what about trade embargoes, like hose imposed upon Cuba?</p><p>Even here, Cuba is best advised to run an MMT system. There is no benefit to doing
otherwise. Why unemploy your workers just because some other nation is not trading
with you? It&rsquo;d be like penalizing your dog for stepping in your neighbours sh1t.</p><p><a href=../100_why_does_it_matter>Next chapter (Pension Funds)</a><br><a href=../12_pension_funds>Previous chapter (Pension Funds)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
