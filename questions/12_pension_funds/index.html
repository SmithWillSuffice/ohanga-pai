made a lot of sense. This was because at the time New Zealand was a small
open economy under the umbrella of the Bretton-Woods fixed exchange rate system.
Under this system the US dollar (USD) was a global reserve currency.
While the USD no longer swapped for gold, other currencies swapped for US dollars,
which is fine if the smaller economies never needed USD.</p><p>If NZ never needed USD then we would not have to borrow USD, so we would never
care about the exchange rate fix. But a lot of goods we import are only for sale in USD,
and so we did end up needing to swap NZD for USD. This puts pressure on the exchange rate,
which under Bretton-Woods was fixed.</p><p>That meant if someone overseas found themselves with a few million NZD,
say from selling to us what we imported, they would have a claim on NZD,
at the fixed exchange rate, and our reserve bank was obligated to supply the NZD,
if claimed. Or the foreigner could buy goods for sale in NZD.
Both actions place pressure on our domestic economy to send them millions
of NZD worth of our output, which also permits our exporters to raise their prices to
get a good return for selling our output.</p><p>Either way, our domestic economy loses, either from goods produced that we are
not consuming, or through a pass-through effect of the higher prices,
since our producers do not care who the sell to, so if the overseas price they
can get goes up, odds are the domestic price will too, all other things being equal.
That is, unless our government imposes export controls.</p><p>Some government will impose a few controls, but a lot do not, and a lot don&rsquo;t
impose controls that are of any benefit (save to the oligarchs).</p><p>But in any case, either way, the fixed exchange rate can be a problem for our
price stability, and particularly if our reserve bank ends up borrowing USD
(or any other foreign currency) because our central bank does not legally create
that currency, so we have to end up &mdash; in one way or another &mdash; artificially
suppressing domestic demand for our real output in order to keep the
fixed exchange rate fixed, otherwise we would soon get into unpayable debt to
the foreign central banks (the bankers for the foreign governments).</p><p>That sort of arrangement is all but neocolonial, since foreigners who have
lots of guns have no qualms about using the threat of military conflict,
or more often these days trade embargoes (and in the extreme case
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU" target=_blank>economic hitmen</a>
</em>),
to extract their claims.</p><p>We could survive fine provided we can produce enough domestically to meet our needs,
import what we fall short of, and still have some excess output that we
do not need &mdash; since in that case we can export our excess and so will not need
to borrow USD to keep our exchange rate fixed.</p><p>Remember now: it is not the exchange rate that is the problem.
The problem is price stability. The cost, under this regime, is incurred when
we cannot export enough, and so are forced to suppress domestic demand for goods.
This is also known as unemployment.
Any artificially suppressed domestic demand for goods results in unemployment,
again in one way or another (unemployment defined as people seeking to earn the
state currency who cannot get it).</p><p>Remember too: the price stability is not really the deep problem, since the
NZ government can always use policies to redistribute from rich to the poor
(Robin Hood taxes). The problem is they don&rsquo;t! Because the rich exert a
disproportionately powerful influence over governments. Robin Hood taxes are
considered politically unworkable. (Unless everyone is poor, so the rich are
not powerful, but then there is no one rich to redistribute from.)
The deep problem is that the price inflations hurt the poorest the most.
<strong><em>That is the problem.</em></strong> It is the <strong><em>only</em></strong> unavoidable problem with the
fixed exchange rate and the gold standard. But it is a <em>big f-ing problem!</em>
It&rsquo;s an enormous bloody problem that we have to eliminate if we desire
a decent society. And that is the goal of all macroeconomics from a
spiritual perspective &mdash; a decent society.</p><h3 id=the-fixed-exchange-rate-problem><a class=anchor href=#the-fixed-exchange-rate-problem title='Anchor for: The fixed exchange rate problem.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The fixed exchange rate problem</h3><p>This is a very insidious state of affairs, because if you think about it for a
second (and I assume you have) what we really need in order to produce the exports to
protect the exchange rate is more employment not less. Via using exports as the
price we pay to get our desired imports without pass-through price inflation.</p><p>But the economics nerds harp on to the politicians that the fix is to
generate unemployment! (to suppress domestic demand.) You see the problem!
The economists have no moral compass, it makes them into idiots.
The labour stick is too short for them, and no matter how much they carve
off it, it is still too short.</p><p>Now none of this occurs if instead we adopted a floating exchange rate.
Because under an exchange rate float the import/export balance will adjust
automatically, so without price inflation effects. If our exports drop off
(maybe due to shipping bottlenecks, transport costs, a war, or bad weather, or whatever)
but foreigners are raising their prices, we just buy less imports.
However, we can still run full employment, because in this case our domestic
currency is now not being constrained by a fixed exchange rate.
We cannot do any better than full employment under any circumstances,
so this is the optimum.</p><p>Under a fixed exchange rate we have a more severe problem if our exports drop off.
These were previously mentioned.</p><p>Finally this brings us to superannuation. Superannuation is a reasonable way
to suppress domestic demand for goods for sale today in the hope they&rsquo;ll be
cheaper to produce &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; (where &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; here means 15 to 30 years or so).
Workers get the same wage, no prices go up, but they save some of the wage in
the superannuation fund, which they know will be paid back through the pension
fund to us upon retirement &mdash; since government is fairly trustworthy
on this due to strong political pressures.</p><p>The government is a fiat currency issuer though, so they never have an <em>operational</em>
problem paying the pension cheques. They can always pay, even if the superannuation fund
goes into negative savings territory. This is just a fictional quantity after all,
points on a scoresheet: a negative on a balance sheet means you owe more than
someone has deposited.
It is not a problem for a currency issuer. They can always make the payments
no matter how negative the number in the fund gets.</p><p>The problem is the fixed exchange rate and more acutely the pressure on our
real supply of goods that we want available for retirees to consume.</p><p>It is not an operational problem for the government (to pay bills), it is a
political psychology problem.</p><h3 id=analogy-to-gold-standard><a class=anchor href=#analogy-to-gold-standard title='Anchor for: Analogy to gold standard.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Analogy to gold standard</h3><p>The best way to understand this is to make the analogy to the gold standard.
When currency is redeemable for gold, as long as the government has a supply of
gold, people will accept the currency. But if the government runs out of gold
they are screwed, and are forced to impose draconian crippling taxes to get back
the claims on the gold they do not have. Either way they tend to get frequent
mass riots, or mass starvation, while the rich hoarders of the gold play on
their fiddles sipping wine.</p><p>Same with a fixed exchange rate system like Bretton-Woods, here the &ldquo;gold&rdquo; is the
US dollar (or a &ldquo;weighted basket&rdquo; of foreign currencies). We can end up owing
other countries their currency, which we cannot type onto our balance sheets
with a computer or ink${}^\ast$. So we are back to the forced selling of our goods that
we might not be able to afford to sell. If we cannot sell enough, then we get
import price hike inflation events.</p><p>${}^\ast$ Why we cannot fake a foreign currency is because of the
central banking system. All banks, and <em>only</em> banks, run the payments clearing system,
and they are all licenced by the state. The central bank holds <em>all</em> the
other bank&rsquo;s reserve accounts.
So any anomalies in the accounting clearances at the end of the
reserve maintenance periods will be automatically red alerts.
The diplomats who are actually economic hitmen will be knocking on our
government doors if we created so much as a few hundred of their currency units.
US dollars do not get through any payments without the central bank knowing.
This is not a matter of imperialism or anything, without the central bank
accounting no currency would be trusted, it&rsquo;d become like bitcoin or worse,
completely wild, at least until some warlord seized hold of all the cash
registers and normalized things again.</p><p>New Zealand is a relatively productive country with surplus output capacity
of goods others want, so we never suffered terribly under Bretton-Woods.
But the risk was always there. Then absurdly, once we removed the choke of
Bretton-Woods, our successive governments <strong><em>invented</em></strong> a risk (called the NAIRU)
that never needed to be invented (more on this soon &mdash; the neoliberal
hysterics era, which tragically continues to this day).</p><p>The Superannuation fund thus acts in this case to defer our spending, for a
hopefully sunnier time ahead, when our exports are back to strength.
Or that&rsquo;s the idea.</p><p>Hopefully you can see the superannuation is not guaranteed to fix the problem.
The real problem is adopting a fixed exchange rate.
The deferred consumption that the superannuation scheme imposes is good
in this case <em>only if</em> in future we can raise our productivity. This is not guaranteed.</p><p>When New Zealand adopted a floating exchange rate in 1985 we forevermore got rid
of this problem. Which meant we no longer needed a superannuation fund for our
retirees. Now the NZ government can pay the pension payments without suffering
price inflation events, because our exchange rate is on a float, it adjusts to
the export level we are able to sustain at full domestic employment. Everyone wins,
or at least everyone absent corruption by our greedy export oligarchs,
stand a chance of winning (in economics that means living up to our full means).</p><h2 id=the-tragedy-in-new-zelaand><a class=anchor href=#the-tragedy-in-new-zelaand title='Anchor for: The Tragedy in New Zelaand.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Tragedy in New Zelaand</h2><p>We did not end up winning from the exchange rate float in 1985. Instead we got cycles
of massive unemployment, sometimes up to 10%, but with underemployment more like 20%.
Even post-COVID-19 stimulus and rebound we are still at 4% unemployment, and
likely 10% under-employment.
A massive waste of Kiwi lives. A massive loss of real output. But why?</p><p>Why did the NZ government not adopt a full employment policy once we moved to a
floating exchange rate?</p><p>The tragedy is that they chose not to run full employment because they still
thought in terms of fixed exchange rate paradigms. They thought unemployment
had to be tolerated to suppress inflation.</p><p>This is the myth of the NAIRU.</p><p>They were ignorant, and still are to this day, because on a floating exchange
rate there is no NAIRU, it is a fictional concept. But those who believe in it
run our government, and their belief tells them unemployment is a &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;
cost we have to pay to keep prices stable. These people are completely${}^\ast$ mad.
But they run our government.</p><p>${}^\ast$ OK, not <em>completely</em> mad, but on this one issue they are completely insane.</p><h2 id=the-nairu-myth><a class=anchor href=#the-nairu-myth title='Anchor for: The NAIRU Myth.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The NAIRU Myth</h2><p>The NAIRU (Non-Accelerating-Inflation Rate of Unemployment) is a fictional concept
that a Kiwi engineer named Bill Phillips is credited with &ldquo;discovering.&rdquo;
This NAIRU is manifested in what is known as the <em>Phillips Curve.</em></p><p>This is a curve plotting unemployment ($x$ axis) against inflation ($y$ axis).
Phillips showed that if import prices are relatively stable, and labour wage bids
are effective, then the private sector cannot reach full employment without
accelerating inflation (they need to raise prices continually to afford the ever
higher wage demands). The workers will demand the wages because the prices rise.
There follows a spiral upwards (hypothetically).</p><p>The unemployment level that equilibrates this competition between capital
and labour is computed numerically to be roughly where a unit increase in wage
results in the same percentage unit rise in the price level (i.e., at unit slope,
but this is only in a model, in the real world it will depend upon industrial and
political and social institutions).
That is the NAIRU rate. (The word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; here can confuse scientists,
it means the percentage change.)
If we go below the NAIRU labour wage demands gain more power and we go back
up the curve, conversely if the price level goes too high above NAIRU employers
gain more power and can bid down the wage demand (or fire workers) and we go
back down the curve.</p><p>The thinking of the elite snobs is that if labour ever gain too much power
they will push the whole economy up the Phillips curve, which we
call <em>hyperinflation</em> &mdash; which is <em>the</em> big bogeyman for people who like to live off
inheritances.</p><p>The conservative and neoliberal solution to avoid hyperinflation is to
suppress wages, artificially, and so we have had generations suffering
labour union crushing and semi-fascistic state police crackdowns on
labour strikes and whatnot that in the old days used to be the way workers
could get their fair wage bargain.</p><p>In modern times the wage bargain is more unfair than it has ever been in
probably 100 years, the capitalist bosses won, and organized labour lost.
We live in misery in the working class. Or at least relative misery. Life ain&rsquo;t bad
for many in New Zealand because we&rsquo;ve always profited off our productive land.
But life is tougher today than it ever needed to be for Gen-X and Gen-Y,
because the Neoliberals (Gen-Boomer) drank the NAIRU koolaid and deliberately
used government power (through privatization, deregulation, union-busting,
and laissez faire) to crush the working class.</p><p>So why was Phillips wrong?</p><p>Bill Phillips was not wrong. It was the economists who were wrong in reading Phillips&rsquo;
papers (remember Phillips was an engineer, not an economist, so he was not
allowed to interpret his own work for the elite educated class of academic
ivory tower economists). John Maynard Keynes understood though, and never would
have subscribed to the NAIRU mythology.</p><p>What Keynes knew (and I suspect Phillips too) was that
<strong>(i)</strong> while it was true that the private sector being given enough sales
to afford the wage demands of workers who see the rich getting richer off their
fat lazy asses, cannot sustain full employment without raising their sales prices,
<strong>(ii)</strong> the government can always hire any unemployed, without putting pressure
on <em>their</em> prices! the monopolist is price setter, not price taker, and the
government is the currency monopolist.</p><p>What Keynes implicitly understood was that governments were currency monopolists,
so never can run out of their own money, and can always pay the wages for
anyone willing to work.
Thus, in a state currency system, there is no NAIRU, it is a total myth,
invented by conservatives and neoliberals who hate the idea of &ldquo;big government&rdquo;
empowering the working class.</p><p>Because if government is known to be powerful enough to hand out meaningful
jobs to anyone who wants to work, &ldquo;Where will we bosses of industry find our
workers to exploit for our profits?&rdquo; (say the neoliberals).
You can see why if John Maynard Keynes were alive today he would not be branded
as a liberal, but as a commie, since he was saying <strong>(a)</strong> governments are that
powerful and <strong>(b)</strong> they ought to be doing this &mdash; running full employment.</p><p>It is not up to liberal elites to say what types of jobs should be available &mdash;
public or private sector, or a mix. It is up to the demos, the people, to decide.
That&rsquo;s the idea of a democracy at least. In most countries communism has no sway
because people generally like private industry. Communists will never gain significant
power in such a society (like the USA, at present). But what Keynes said was that
any country issuing it&rsquo;s own currency (aka. tax credits) can have as much
communism or as little communism as its people desire. The NAIRU is just not a
constraint to such governments, if only they knew.</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title='Anchor for: Caveats.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>I do not have too many caveats for this chapter. One is that building
monetary system models that show the Phillips curve effect (NAIRU) is easy,
all you need to do is delete the government sector from your model.
Similarly it is easy to show the NAIRU is a myth, simply by putting back in the
government sector, and then setting parameters for your model equivalent to
full employment.</p><p>I am still working on writing the software for such models in a human readable
form, so would like to promise the appearance of dashboards for these models soon,
but I cannot promise a fixed due date.
