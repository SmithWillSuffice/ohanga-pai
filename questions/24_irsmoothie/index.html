<p>Internet friend Derek McDaniel posted some
<a href=https://derek7mc.medium.com/how-raising-rates-smooths-inflation-929bd37ae9e3 target=_blank>interesting stuff on Medium</a>
worth writing about. I&rsquo;ll use it as an entry into some wider issues of a continued
massive need for MMT awareness. Right?&mldr; as if we don&rsquo;t all know this need! What am I
doing here? Trying to activate activated activists?</p>
<h2 id=if-you-are-the-government><a class=anchor href=#if-you-are-the-government title="Anchor for: If &ldquo;You&rdquo; are the Government."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> If &ldquo;You&rdquo; are the Government</h2>
<p>&mldr; or a monopoly currency issuer, driving demand for your currency with coercive tax liabilities or similar means.</p>
<p>Given this, one way Derek points out for limiting inflation is to pull cash out
of circulation by issuing bonds (Treasury securities). MMT helps simplify by
noting a Tsy bond is simply a very secure savings account or term deposit
(government guaranteed).</p>
<p>If you wish to get bogged down in legal niceties, hey, be my guest, but what I do is
write from an MMT lens for the generic nation, so I am not considering the insanity
of US Treasury needing a nominal positive balance in Its account at the FED to make
legal payments &mdash; with all the subsequent repo and reverse repo fidgeting.</p>
<p>We can instead assume Treasury and Central Bank are consolidated, so
if the CB payments guys demand money from the Treasury gals, they can just use an
over-draft. It&rsquo;s Left Pocket of government owing the Right Pocket of government.</p>
<p>This MMT consolidation followed by a latter apparent separation
(left-pocket/right-pocket) is important because the records need to be kept track of,
to prevent fraud, and to allow public oversight.</p>
<h3 id=then-you-can-do-many-things-to-limit-inflation><a class=anchor href=#then-you-can-do-many-things-to-limit-inflation title="Anchor for: Then You can do many things to limit inflation."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Then You can do many things to limit inflation</h3>
<p>The particular case I am going to imagine (only in my imagination) Derek was perhaps
considering is when the inflation is being driven by a supply shock event, like a
pandemic, or a war, famine, asteroid strike, hurricane, oligopoly price gouging,
oil monopoly, fresh drinking water monopolist (who could that nest lé be?), or
whatever.</p>
<p>In this case a supply contraction means existing purchasing power (effective demand)
is going to cause a market problem in <em>some</em> relative price adjustments upwards. If
severe enough this can bleed into other sectors and cause a general increase in the
price level, or at least blips in the CPI that become sustained and do not drop back
down too fast.</p>
<p>Add to this the problem that when consumers get accustomed to higher prices, the
firms tend to stay at the current level. Although no firms like losing out, they also
do not want to lose customers. But if the consumer sentiment is for permanent upward
price adjustment no firm will loose too many customers if they stay at the upwards
adjusted price. Only a few firms tend to drop back down to previous prices when the
supply shock ends. In this way price inflation is a bit of a ratchet. Mainstream
economists call it &ldquo;sticky prices&rdquo; which is a dopey metaphor, but it makes the same
point, if you like some obscurity as a cost for getting fewer words.</p>
<h3 id=why-not-invest-to-boost-supply><a class=anchor href=#why-not-invest-to-boost-supply title="Anchor for: Why not invest to boost supply?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Why not invest to boost supply?</h3>
<p>Why not indeed. This would be an MMT &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; option.
In a supply shock event, first seek to bring back supply.</p>
<p>It is after-all the <em>standard of living</em> that most people desire to be elevated,
not inflation.</p>
<p>I guess the psychological order or preferences for public sentiment in a supply shock event are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get supply back first.</li>
<li>Failing supply getting back fast enough, limit demand (cause unemployment).</li>
<li>Failing limiting demand let the inflation run its course and support the real wage.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dumb-dumb normie public. An MMT informed public would reverse 2 and 3. In
fact option 2 would never occur. In a supply shock the very worst thing to do is
cause more unemployment. You want <em>more</em> employment, not less. Workers make stuff.
It&rsquo;s fascinating mainstream economists never seem to admit this to themselves, or out
loud, but they <em>must</em> know it?</p>
<p>In fact, under MMT analysis <strong><em>unemployment is never a permissible policy option.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id=what-about-bonds-for-cash-withdrawal><a class=anchor href=#what-about-bonds-for-cash-withdrawal title="Anchor for: What about bonds for cash withdrawal?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> What about bonds for cash withdrawal?</h3>
<p>But ok, hiking interest rates does not directly cause unemployment, and is in fact a
stimulus via trickle down effects, provided the government debt-to-GDP ratio is high
enough. The question then is whether trickle-down is a good and fair way to smooth out
a supply shock inflation era?</p>
<p>I would argue no, it is not.</p>
<p>Why do we want the people who already have savings to earn more, when the problem
is a supply shortage? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rewarding savers&rdquo; is one thing, but savers do not need rewarding, they are a
curse &mdash; in the macro. Paradox of Thrift.</p>
<p>The public purpose is best served when currency circulates. So government has no
purpose in rewarding savers. Savers know how to reward themselves, and that will
always be in relative terms. There is no need on Earth for a government that issues
Its own currency to incentivise more savers. Even in a supply shortage crisis.</p>
<p>But if governments have no clue and can see no other way, then issuing bonds to
withdraw cash out of circulation is a viable option for smoothing the supply-shock
inflation out over time.</p>
<p>However, there is a progressive way to do this: rather than issuing bonds, the
government can give wage earners an income partially in bonds, so the savers are
those who might not otherwise save. Basically the policy adopted in war time
footings: war bonds, but in peace times it&rsquo;s just a social impact bond of a sort.
This prevents the regressive trickle-down of indiscriminate bond issuance to only
people who already have money (so who would not be restricted in purchasing power
anyway).</p>
<p>It is more trickle-up this progressive way. A low wage earner can choose later to
sell their bond to get cash if needed, but can likely command more than the coupon
price, or at least not much lower.</p>

<h2 id=conclusion><a class=anchor href=#conclusion title="Anchor for: Conclusion."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>All right. But at the end of the day why choose to force the central bank to smooth
inflation in this fashion? There really is no need. It is simply one policy option,
not the best.</p>
<pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>Note for another day:
</code></pre><p>Had a few ideas about Minksy &ldquo;Stability is destabilizing.&rdquo; MMT gives us insights
into how to avoid instability, to have stability that is not unstable.
Minksy was of course following Keynes. But we have to understand their assumptions.
What drives euphoric behaviour?</p>
<p>Ultimately it is greed, but &ldquo;greed&rdquo; can also be low level anxiety and simply a desire
to &ldquo;get ahead&rdquo; under a competitive system. That, I think, is the real problem.
If I am right then this points to some fairly clear solutions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate economic anxiety.</li>
<li>Eliminate needless speculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are at least key goals. Then the question is how? I think MMT gives us plenty of
policy options. I can&rsquo;t even list them all, but I&rsquo;ll mention a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand pensions. No one needs to be forced to save for retirement.</li>
<li>At the same time reduce all support for savers. Government does not need, and has
no role, in incentivising saving. Let that be a private sector concern, with sensible
regulations.</li>
<li>Run currency inflation hot, but energy cool. (q.v. Sam Levey.)</li>
<li>Hot currency inflation can create anxiety or FOMO though, so the <em>way</em> to run
inflation hot is to do it <em>only</em> at the base, target the real wage floor.</li>
<li>Make such pro-inflation policy clear and transparent. Much like a Gesell currency,
everyone should know what the upwards wage adjustment (only at the base) will be and
when.</li>
<li>Eliminate as much speculation as possible: allow trade only in real goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last policy might be tricky. How to avoid people speculating on financial
derivatives and whatnot without creating a black market?</p>
<p>I think in finance a black market here is a fair price to pay for outlawing pure
speculative finance. It is a moral position. If you get caught you know the
consequences. The question is only what policy can be easily enforced with limited
fraud investigation and prosecution resources.</p>
<p>For the latter, maybe it is regrettable, but I think digital payments have to be on
record for seller. Anonymity for buyers I think is sufficient public protection.
Even in MMT circles people debate this, I favour a civil society that is
non-anarchic, but also as liberal as we can make it without financial instability.</p>
<p>The stability of a financial system is a greater freedom from anxiety for all so is
in many ways a goal that is somewhat self-justified. This is always the way: by
allowing one freedom we almost always necessarily curtail others. The question for a
democracy is one of preferences for possible freedoms.</p>
<p>I think using the state currency is not a freedom that should come without reciprocal
obligations when conducting commerce. But maybe that&rsquo;s just my taste. My taste is
that I do not want government playing too heavy a hand, nor do I want so feeble a
government that the public, especially lower income groups, suffer needless anxiety.</p>
<h2 id=why-other-systems-cannot-prevent-instability><a class=anchor href=#why-other-systems-cannot-prevent-instability title="Anchor for: Why other systems cannot prevent instability."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Why other systems cannot prevent instability</h2>
<p>Investors can also hedge their risk using various financial instruments like
credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and so forth. But in a world governed
by stock&ndash;flow consistent accounting rules these instrument cannot be guaranteed 100%
safe. If agent B buys instruments to offload their risk some other agent C is now
bearing the risk.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say <em>financial fragility</em> is broadly speaking any systemic risk of a
credit crisis.</p>
<p>The only way as a whole &ldquo;The System&rdquo; can avoid financial fragility is if credit
and income grow in proportion to real output. The Keynes&ndash;Minsky euphoric psychology
always gets ahead of the real output curve, or so history seems to tell us.
Thus no amount of hedging risk can protect The System as a whole, it can only protect
some but at the cost of exposing others. (Usually exposing those who can least
afford it, or who have played no hand in creating the fragility in the first place.)</p>
<p>So the problem is to get rid of the greed that fuels the euphoria.</p>
<p>I have always believed an economy based on morality, not markets, is the best
framework for achieving the desired stability. Unfortunately this probably awaits
a spiritual transformation of the human species in-the-large. Fortunately, whether
nature&rsquo;s circumstances or ordinary decent working people push us there, I think
the wait need not be too long. Because purely darwinistic &ldquo;natural forces&rdquo; cannot
well regulate markets or policy, the choice of whether this stability and peaceful
economics transform society within our lifetimes is indeed a choice humanity has
available.</p>
