The MMT lens suggests the
inflation rate *<em><em>is</em></em> the interest rate, or at least a high enough
interest rate will equal the inflation rate.
But not all MMT informed economists would agree, and that is pretty much only
because the econometric data analysis is inconclusive. However, we are working
on analysis to show the MMT base case is correct under most &ldquo;normal&rdquo; opening
circumstances, which is that in normal times an upwards adjustment in the
interest rate is inflationary, one-for-one.</p><p>This occurs when the <em>own price</em> for the currency dominates the general price level.
(The &ldquo;<em>own price</em>&rdquo; being the interest rate).</p><p>This is because the interest rate directly, one-to-one, raises forward prices,
as well as provides the necessary free money to afford those prices (through interest income).</p><p>The nuance is that for people who are forced by circumstances to take out bank credit,
this way of generating inflation is incredibly unjust and regressive.
It feeds interest income to people who already have money, fueling the economy at the top,
but crushes the poor who are reduced to buying food on credit cards.</p><p>The instability of high interest rates is thus more a social instability.
The purely monetary nominal inflation cna e sustained for ever, but the debt burden
faced by the poor cannot.
They will either die or file for bankruptcy and thus incur all the downstream costs
of having filed for bankruptcy (credit downgrades, lose of houses, and all that).</p><p>The fair discipline on a booming hot economy is thus not the interest rate
upwards adjustment. The discipline has to be on real resource rationing and
fine sand taxes on unnecessary pollution, waste, fraud and corruption. The latter
methods of discipline hit the rich the harder, but never unfairly.</p><h2 id=proving-interest-rates-hikes-are-pro-inflationary><a class=anchor href=#proving-interest-rates-hikes-are-pro-inflationary title='Anchor for: Proving Interest Rates Hikes are Pro-Inflationary.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Proving Interest Rates Hikes are Pro-Inflationary</h2><p>We are working on this for the case of New Zealand. But for a few cases
Richard Werner has already done some of the analysis. In his paper
<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521915001477 target=_blank>Reconsidering Monetary Policy: An Empirical Examination of the Relationship Between Interest Rates and Nominal GDP Growth</a>
Werner shows that for the UK, USA, Germany and Japan.</p><blockquote><p>In 6 out of 8 cases the hypothesis that &ldquo;<em>low interest rates cause economic growth</em>&rdquo; can be <strong><em>rejected.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>This goes against the grain of about 95% of all economics analysis by the
major schools of thought for over 200 years.
Yet it is fully in accord with the MMT lens. Hihg interest rates add to
bank reserves whenever the government Treasury issue is above about 50% of GDP.
The reason? When government Treasury bill issue is above 50% of GDP the
government is a huge net payer of interest, which prevailing tax return cannot drain.</p><p>Yes, it is highly regressive stimulus, and it is basic income but only for people
who already have money, but it is a stimulus nonetheless.
MMT people do not advocate for this type of stimulus, and would prefer the
central bank interest rate to be dropped to zero.</p><p>The way to stimulate an economy is to invest in productive fruitful jobs,
and the government, as the monopoly currency issuer, can always do the minimum
necessary by hiring all sustainable resources (especially labour) which the
private sector is unwilling to hire.</p><p>This results in higher purchasing power in the pockets of labour, who spend most
of their income, which drives sales for firms. That is the correct functionally
targetted type of stimulus a failing economy needs, not higher interest rates.</p><p>Werner&rsquo;s results are more consistent with the story that central banks raise
interest rates always &ldquo;too late,&rdquo; after a supply shock has already caused
cost-push inflation. The recession is then already baked-in and the
inflation pressure eases as lower income households get crushed.
Then again, too late, the central bank takes their foot off the gas pedal and
lowers the interest rate, which accelerates the recession.</p><p>It is all a bit perverse and backwards you see. There is no reason why the
monetarist policies will work as advertised, and they never really do, and
what is really driving the macroeconomic cycles is the government&rsquo;s automatically
baked-in fiscal stabilizers (tax revenues and welfare spending).</p><p>The central bankers think they are doing the job, but they&rsquo;re not,
and what they might be doing to counter the cycle at the credit margins is
backwards, pro-cyclical, not counter-cyclical, and regressive
(favouring the rich, hurting the poor). As Werner&rsquo;s data analysis shows,
for the most part.</p><h3 id=methodology><a class=anchor href=#methodology title='Anchor for: Methodology.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Methodology</h3><p>Initially we are going to redo Werner&rsquo;s analysis for New Zealand.
Our conclusion will differ though, since Werner thinks central bankers dominate,
whereas MMT analysis shows the fiscal authority is by far more dominant.</p><p>At Ōhanga Pai we favour stimulating an economic system from the base,
from where real people are in desperate need for spending power,
and not from the top where excess spending power already exists.
So we would advocate zero interest rate policy, coupled with a Job Guarantee
and targetted fiscal stimulus &mdash; such as government direct investments
(no &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; your own IOU) in start-up worker cooperatives running
sustainable production enterprises.</p><p>This advocacy sounds good to us, but to be credible we will need to show that
the low interest rates are not a stimulus, and the high rates are a stimulus
under certain conditions, but in a terrible socially unjust way.
We can do this by looking at how the lags and leads in the time series go,
using Grange Causality tests, and if possible by looking at rate of change
of household debt/credit by income levels, if the data has been published.</p><p><a href=./>Next chapter (TBC)</a><br><a href=../5_deficit_myths>Previous chapter (Deficit Myths)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
