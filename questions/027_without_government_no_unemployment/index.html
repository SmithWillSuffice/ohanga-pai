crudest form: <em>without government there is no unemployment</em>. But MMT has a
very different perspective. We want a good government <strong><em>and</em></strong> we want full
employment, and we can in fact have both. It is a political choice, not a
whim of natural markets.</p><p>The (correct) MMT statement is,</p><blockquote><p>With government there is unemployment by design, from inception, but also
<em>with government</em> all the unemployment generated should (morally and
optimally) be immediately eliminated.</p></blockquote><h2 id=question-without-government-rightarrow-full-employment><a class=anchor href=#question-without-government-rightarrow-full-employment title='Anchor for: Question: Without Government $\Rightarrow$ Full employment?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Question: Without Government $\Rightarrow$ Full employment?</h2><p>Yes. But it is a bit more nuanced.</p><p>I had a private conversation with Prof Steve Keen on this, and he was
disagreeing with Mosler and Mitchell. For what it&rsquo;s worth I side with Mosler
and Mitchell. But it comes down to definitions. I suspect Steve was thinking
of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; as people working, which it is not.</p><p>People are working whether they are getting a pay check or not, typically.
Maybe working hard watching YoutUbe and eating junk food, but if they are
not actively seeking to exchange their labour for the currency then they are
not unemployed. In Steve keen&rsquo;s definition they would be &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; &mdash; but
what he means is idle.</p><p>In a monetary economy idleness does not equate to unemployment.</p><p>People often get this wrong about MMT. MMT uses a certain definition that
others are perhaps not fully aware of:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Unemployment</strong> or <strong><em>to be unemployed</em></strong> is defined by seeking to
exchange one&rsquo;s labour time for the tax credit.</p></blockquote><p>What makes this a truly important definition is that it is useful and has
several concrete functional implications &mdash; implications for how the monetary
system is governed&mldr;. or negligently governed.</p><p>In the olden days you could substitute an analogous definition, such as
seeking not to be beaten to death by a slave owner, or seeking to not have
one&rsquo;s hut burned down by the colonists. I am pretty sure most people, even
libertarians would see the MMT definition as the less evil. But that&rsquo;s no fault
of MMT that <em>unemployment</em> sounds pretty nasty. It is a fault of the currency
monopolist. They have no reason to keep people unemployed nor any reason to
make the work people seek to earn tax credits onerous.</p><h3 id=how-is-the-answer-yes><a class=anchor href=#how-is-the-answer-yes title='Anchor for: How is the answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How is the answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?</h3><p>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when you suitably generalize what the word &ldquo;government&rdquo;
means. The MMT generalization is,</p><blockquote><p><strong>Government</strong> is the, or one of several, monopoly powers that are using
tax liabilities to drive an otherwise worthless currency.</p></blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s abstract and call this governing power simple $\mathfrak{G}$.</p><p>This applies even if the $\mathfrak{G}$ promises to redeem their scorepoints
for gold or silver or pizza. This does not make the currency a real commodity,
it is still nominal scorekeeping. Not just because $\mathfrak{G}$ could at any
time (with monopoly power) decide to stop redeeming, but also because even
when $\mathfrak{G}$ promises to redeem for a real commodity that is determined
by their imposed rate of exchange. They tell you what their currency is worth.
They set both the own price and the exchange price.</p><p>It is also true regardless of how weak the $\mathfrak{G}$ is, if they are
puppets swayed by oligarchs, then all that really means is you&rsquo;ve got a
specific type of government, but still one of the generalized forms. In this
case the form of government is a hybrid perhaps, but mostly an oligarchy. It
is still a $\mathfrak{G}$.</p><h3 id=how-is-the-answer-no><a class=anchor href=#how-is-the-answer-no title='Anchor for: How is the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How is the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</h3><p>If you do not have a $\mathfrak{G}$ &mdash; of some foprm, any form, &mdash; then you
have no currency. Maybe you have some weird hybrid currency system, but
whoever controls the scoprepoints is your $\mathfrak{G}$, or one of many. If
they are not using a tax system &mdash; or something like it &mdash; to drive demand
for the otherwise worthless scorepoints, then you have no currency, as MMT
defines the currency unit.</p><p>If you have no currency then no one is seeking to exchange their labour for
getting those scorepoints. So there is no unemployment.</p><p>Thus, no matter how you slice things, unemployment is created by
$\mathfrak{G}$. Of one form or another. Steve Keen was wrong.</p><p>But of course, to be generous, Keen is using hios own <em>different</em> definition
of unemployment, which presumably has the idle rich being &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; (not
wage earning). MMT sees things differently,. the existence of those people is
a loss of real output, and an effective rent on the labour of everyone else
who is producing real goods for society. But still, those idle slackers are
not unemployed. They are just <em>not working</em>. If they are not <em>seeking</em> to
exchange their labour time for the currency then they are fully employed.</p><h2 id=what-do-we-really-want><a class=anchor href=#what-do-we-really-want title='Anchor for: What Do We Really Want?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What Do We Really Want?</h2><p>We want more than full employment. By MMT definitions full employment is
desirable, but not necessarily optimal.</p><p>What is optimal is everyone contributing to real output according to their
capacity, with mild tax obligation motives, but more importantly for the
motive of desiring a healthier society. That means all work being done needs
to be useful work, in terms of some ill-defined but meaningful sense of
increasing the prosperity of society at all levels, not just for those at the
top of the heap.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:35%><col span=1 style=width:10%><col span=1 style=width:35%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../026_tradebackwards>Previous Question</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Q</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../100_why_does_it_matter>Next Question</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../026_tradebackwards>Trade Backwards</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../100_why_does_it_matter>Why MMT Matters</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
