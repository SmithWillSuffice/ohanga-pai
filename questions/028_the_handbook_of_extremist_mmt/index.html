None of the aphorisms in this chapter
are &ldquo;from MMT&rdquo;. They are all my own opinion. However, it is not satirical
or parody in any _other_respect but the chapter title and heading.
Or is it? ðŸ¤£</p><p>If in doubt: a good aphorism is often a humorous half-truth, the funny bit
about it is because the bit that is a lie is completely beside the point
but will nevertheless be misconstrued by all and sundry potatoheads. In this
case, the latter are all professional economists.</p><h2 id=extremist-mmt-aphorisms><a class=anchor href=#extremist-mmt-aphorisms title='Anchor for: Extremist MMT Aphorisms.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Extremist MMT Aphorisms</h2><p>MMT&rsquo;ers are <em>not</em> economists, they are legal realists and anthropologists,
despite whatever else they tell you.</p><p>Gold has never been money, but the money has sometimes been made of gold.ðŸ¤¯</p><p>Inflation is never a financial nor economic problem, the policy response
is the problem.</p><p>Inflation is an <em>effect</em> not a cause.</p><p>&ldquo;Ballooning government deficits and debt&rdquo; enable the non-government
sector to fly.</p><p>&ldquo;Living beyond our means and borrowing from China!&rdquo; is what reactionary
conservatives feverishly type into social media streams all night to train
the LLM&rsquo;s. But it is also what well-educated progressives have no retort
or counter-response towards, which means we are all screwed and ruled over
by idiots.</p><p>There are only about 1% of humans alive who are living beyond our means.
Unfortunately, when <em>they</em> say, &ldquo;We need to cut government spending because
we are living beyond out means!&rdquo; the last clause is true.</p><p>There will never be an AI Singularity with such LLM training texts.</p><p>Left-wing politics is pro-worker, period. But so should be right-wing
politics: that the latter is not is a total moral disgrace.</p><p>The real costs of unemployment in one decade exceed the real costs and
social fabric destruction of all wars in all human history, so inflation
fear mongering is a mental illness.</p><p>The government deficit is the non-government sector surplus, but only if
you are not an economist.</p><p>The government debt is &ldquo;paid off&rdquo; (retired) every single accounts settlement
day, so every month&mldr; without a single tax-payer in sight. But tell that
to the economists and they will not believe you.</p><p>If a government body says or tries to borrow their own currency off the
banks they created by state licence, the appropriate remedy is to vote them
out of office on mental illness grounds alone.</p><p>When the government is &ldquo;spending like a drunken sailor&rdquo;, the appropriate
response is to shut-up and take their money.</p><p>Inflation is a <em>de facto</em> tax on hoarded wealth. Wait&mldr; where was the
aphorism? The aphorism is that Austrian School lunatics are not
always wrong about everything, just about most things.</p><p>Yes, oligarchs and their price mark-ups cause an undesirable form of
inflation through relative price adjustments, the harm is caused by
hysteresis in wage adjustments not by the inflation <em>per se</em>, but it
would not occur with a wise government.</p><p>Never worry about inflation. Fully employ anyone willing to work for tax
credits, and give them the freedom to decide how to contribute to their
community if they do not despite public sector jobs.</p><p>Never worry about private sector causes of inflation. Just don&rsquo;t allow
them.
(This aphorism can only be aimed at a currency monopolist, not you or me,
if aimed at you or me it is a poisonous snake, in the sense of blame on
the victim for their inaction.)</p><p>Political inaction from the demos is not the fault of the workers, they
are slaving to eat to survive. Any workers making just demands on their
government are heroes, superior to Captain American and Superman (but <em>only</em>
because the latter two people are fictionalðŸ¤£).</p><p>One must sometimes give comic book geeks a comic&mldr; to learn MMT from.</p><p>Knowledge of MMT is not wisdom. MMT wisdom is knowing the fair and just
policy response available.</p><p>A wise government is by definition a strong government.</p><p>A strong government does not need a large army to a first approximation,
because strength is in the love of the people. They will then rise to their
own defence, and their government&rsquo;s, and in defence of other people of other
nations, in un-numbered guerrilla ways if attacked.</p><p>You people cannot rise to their own defence is you immiserate them through
an unemployed labour buffer scheme, or other fiscal austerity (and the rest).</p><p>Cryptocurrency is a plan cooked up by compsci nerds to (sort of legally)
take money off silly people with their full consent. It is pretty ingenious.
But morally and ecologically repugnant, which means not all genius is good
to have.</p><p>Full employment is not a conspiracy theory policy and CIA Op.
It is justice. The idea of a &ldquo;job&rdquo; however needs to be updated, to mean
any spiritual endeavour in a trade, craft, art or profession that serves
one&rsquo;s community.</p><p>One (of sound mind and moral clarity) never compensates spiritual endeavour
with a pittance of a UBI.</p><p>One should always <em>fully</em> compensate spiritual endeavours if One is the
currency monopoly. There is no reason not to.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../027_without_government_no_unemployment>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../027_without_government_no_unemployment>"Without Government, Unemployment?"</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
