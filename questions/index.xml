I will always consider spiritual economics (which Ōhanga Pai is all about) as way above and beyond MMT. The thing about cold hard MMT is that it is open to the critique of &amp;ldquo;fetishizing work.&amp;rdquo; Although plenty of MMT scholars point out that&amp;rsquo;s a false bad-faith attack. To understand this, first let&amp;rsquo;s define,
f-MMT as just &amp;ldquo;The MMT framework&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; this is the macroeconomics lens you get when you understand raw MMT, as in Mosler&amp;#39;s books or Bill Mitchell&amp;#39;s brilliant blog (even Aussies are useful for some things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure Bill is an &amp;ldquo;Aussie,&amp;rdquo; he&amp;rsquo;s more like a gangly hairy human unicorn who talks like he&amp;rsquo;d smell of weed but probably smells of 1960&amp;rsquo;s aftershave dude).</description></item><item><title>Inflation Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/4_inflation_myths/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/4_inflation_myths/</guid><description>Myths about Inflation and the Reality Inflation is defined as a continual increase in the general price level. It is imprecisely measured by indictors like the CPI (consumer price index, a weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale in the state currency units).
Does Government Net Spending Cause Inflation? If you think &amp;ldquo;yes,&amp;rdquo; then you have succumbed to the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) myth.
The reality is that never in all rcorded history has governemnt deficits cuased hyperinlfaitons.</description></item><item><title>Tax Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/3_tax_myths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/3_tax_myths/</guid><description>Myths about Taxation and the Reality The reality:
Currency issuers do not, and cannot logically, use tax return for their spending. Currency users (like provincial or municipal governments) do not need tax receipts for their funding either, but local currency-using governments that do not receive sufficient central government grant funds can be forced to impose taxes to get funds (numbers, scorepoints, in their bank accounts). The myth is that governments need to get their own currency off tax-payers before they can spend it!</description></item><item><title>What is Money?</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/2_what_is_money/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/2_what_is_money/</guid><description>This post is foundational. I know it is not what leftie activists like to here staraight up. Defiintions about finance and economci systems are for nerds, right?
Wrong. We can pont out severl things both lefties and conservatives get wrong, even when their hearts are in the right place. Foremost among these is the tax payer funding myth. The trouble is, the requisite background to understanding why &amp;ldquo;tax yaer funding&amp;rdquo; is an understanding of what money is, in essence, and in practice.</description></item><item><title>Basic MMT and Economic Justice</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/</guid><description>For most of this whole course on MMT I am going to use the example of New Zealand, since many people claim MMT only applies to a country like the USA which enjoys a global reserve currency status. This would be false. MMT applies perfectly well to a small open economy like New Zealand. The currency is the NZD.
The Bare Minimum If you have a very sharp mind and keen intelligence you can almost derive answers to most of the basic questions concerning state currency monopoly systems (which would describe most monetary systems in all major countries today) using the principles in the following four subsections:</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Ōhanga Pai Q&A</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/0_introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/0_introduction/</guid><description>This section Questions is for mostly philosophical discussions (in article form). Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy and fiscal versus monetary policy. For public banking (really just banking in general) I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn heavily upon the prior work of Warren Mosler, Randall Wray, and Eric Tymoigne.
For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and Bill Mitchell &amp;amp; Pavlina Tcherneva . For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon Money on the Left and Stephanie Kelton @Market Watch.</description></item></channel></rss>
