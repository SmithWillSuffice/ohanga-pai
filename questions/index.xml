I&amp;rsquo;ll use it as an entry into some wider issues of a continued massive need for MMT awareness. Right?&amp;hellip; as if we don&amp;rsquo;t all know this need! What am I doing here? Trying to activate activated activists?
If &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rdquo; are the Government &amp;hellip; or a monopoly currency issuer, driving demand for your currency with coercive tax liabilities or similar means.</description></item><item><title>Shadow Banking</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/23_shadow_banking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/23_shadow_banking/</guid><description>Short article for this chapter, and mainly some links. Shadow banking arises when people find a need for credit and cannot get it from a licenced bank. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the basic story.
Overview Synopsis: (a) There is no essential need for shadow banks. (b) Shadow banks nevertheless pop up because government licencers fail to adequately provision the private banks. (c) The basic provision needed is not cash, but full 100% deposit insurance.</description></item><item><title>Interest Rate Discount</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/22_discounting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/22_discounting/</guid><description>In recent Twitter discourse (or should that be childish spats?) a few MMT&amp;rsquo;ers are sniping at other MMT&amp;rsquo;ers on how to best conduct socail discoourse. To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are major disagreements in MMT analysis, but the emphais on the politics varies form person to person.
Thus, we get wbmosler who emphasises how the US economy is on a mild boom or bull run, thanks to interest rate hikes.</description></item><item><title>Why does all this matter?</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/100_why_does_it_matter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/100_why_does_it_matter/</guid><description>Why does anything matter? I will always consider spiritual economics (which Ōhanga Pai is all about) as way above and beyond MMT. The thing about cold hard MMT is that it is open to the critique of &amp;ldquo;fetishizing work.&amp;rdquo; Although plenty of MMT scholars point out that&amp;rsquo;s a false bad-faith attack &amp;mdash; and I agree, most MMT economists and activists also share the same spiritual lens I do, they are just too sheepish to admit macroeconomics is more about justice than &amp;ldquo;distribution of output.</description></item><item><title>Punked Plutocrat Power Plays</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/21_powerplays/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/21_powerplays/</guid><description>The Hard Problem of MMT It&amp;rsquo;s about time I start writing more about the Hard Problem of MMT. This is the problem of getting nations that have MMT currency systems to actually (a) acknowledge this, and (b) use this knowledge to implement the MMT Base Case, meaning,
Permanent Zero Interest Rate Policy National Job Guarantee Pension Payments Made When Due (scrap the phony Trust Funds) Narrow Banking proposals It goes without saying that anyone dimly aware of MMT will run this base case, if in power.</description></item><item><title>Problems with 'Sovereignty' in the Periphery Nations</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/20_peripherynations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/20_peripherynations/</guid><description>Some fresh MMT education material starts today. I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting to the Blog recently more regularly, since starting the DougBot Project , and as part of that research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.
To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the USA?&amp;hellip; well, c&amp;rsquo;mon, keep up you laggards).</description></item><item><title>Pension Fund Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/12_pension_funds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/12_pension_funds/</guid><description>In this chapter we take a look at superannuation schemes, why they are useless today and maybe even harmful, and why they were at one time useful in the past.
Up-front, to avoid you going away immediately, I will say superannuation funds are not harmful if governments running the schemes do not use them to create mass unemployment. The trouble is they do! Yet it&amp;rsquo;s just a policy mistake, so can be corrected.</description></item><item><title>Interest Rate Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/6_interest_rate_myths/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/6_interest_rate_myths/</guid><description>This is one of the more contentious chapters. The MMT lens suggests the inflation rate is the interest rate, or at least a high enough interest rate will equal the inflation rate. But not all MMT informed economists would agree, and that is pretty much only because the econometric data analysis is inconclusive. However, we are working on analysis to show the MMT base case is correct under most &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; opening circumstances, which is that in normal times an upwards adjustment in the interest rate is inflationary, one-for-one.</description></item><item><title>Deficit Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/5_deficit_myths/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/5_deficit_myths/</guid><description>There are two prevalent myths about government deficits.
(Myth 1.) Government deficits accumulate to government debt, which must be paid back in higher taxes. (Myth 2.) Government deficits are not stimulus, because increasing the money supply (which is what a net government deficit does) will just increase prices, if no taxes are raised, so the purchasing power of the extra dollars lowers to adjust to the status quo, and the net effect is just a temporary disruption in the market.</description></item><item><title>Inflation Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/4_inflation_myths/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/4_inflation_myths/</guid><description>Myths about Inflation and the Reality Inflation is defined as a continual increase in the general price level. It is imprecisely measured by indicators like the CPI (consumer price index, a weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale in the state currency units).
Does Government Net Spending Cause Inflation? If you think &amp;ldquo;yes,&amp;rdquo; then you have succumbed to the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) myth.
Note that the QTM identity is an equation that expresses an identity, so it is not wrong.</description></item><item><title>Tax Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/3_tax_myths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/3_tax_myths/</guid><description>Myths about Taxation and the Reality The reality:
Currency issuers do not, and cannot logically, use tax return for their spending. Currency users like you and I do not use tax return for our spending either, because we have legal authority to impose taxes. Special currency users like provincial or municipal governments) do not need tax receipts for their funding either, but local currency-using governments that do not receive sufficient central government grant funds can be forced to impose taxes to get funds (numbers, scorepoints, in their bank accounts).</description></item><item><title>What is Money?</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/2_what_is_money/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/2_what_is_money/</guid><description>This post is foundational. I know it is not what leftie activists like to read straight up. Definitions about finance and economic systems are for nerds, right?
Wrong. We can point out several things both lefties and conservatives get horribly wrong for their own causes, even when their hearts are in the right place. Foremost among these is the tax payer funding myth. The trouble is, the requisite background to understanding why &amp;ldquo;tax payer funding&amp;rdquo; is a myth, involves an understanding of what money is, in essence, and in practice.</description></item><item><title>Basic MMT and Economic Justice</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/</guid><description>For most of this whole course on MMT I am going to use the example of New Zealand, since many people claim MMT only applies to a country like the USA which enjoys a global reserve currency status. This would be false. MMT applies perfectly well to a small open economy like New Zealand. The currency is the NZD.
The Bare Minimum If you have a very sharp mind and keen intelligence you can almost derive answers to most of the basic questions concerning state currency monopoly systems (which would describe most monetary systems in all major countries today) using the principles in the following four subsections:</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Ōhanga Pai Q&A</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/0_introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/0_introduction/</guid><description>This section Questions is for mostly philosophical discussions (in article form). Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy and fiscal versus monetary policy. For public banking (really just banking in general) I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn heavily upon the prior work of Warren Mosler, Randall Wray, and Eric Tymoigne.
For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and Bill Mitchell &amp;amp; Pavlina Tcherneva . For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon Money on the Left and Stephanie Kelton @Market Watch.</description></item></channel></rss>
