rich. So is disconnected from working class concerns</p></blockquote><p>Nick continues:</p><p><em>&ldquo;The system arose from trade settlements (oil, mostly) using the dollar.
It creates demand for the dollar. It is just ledger-keeping by foreign banks for (mostly) oil-rich folk and corporations.</em></p><p>&ldquo;<em>If they didn’t want to transact in US$, then nobody is stopping them from using a different currency. But that would make everything slower, more complicated, and costly.</em>&rdquo;</p><h3 id=extra-liquidity><a class=anchor href=#extra-liquidity title='Anchor for: Extra Liquidity?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Extra Liquidity?</h3><p>No. The FED does foreign reverse repos to manage liquidity and demand. And
all US$ transactions are recorded by the “mother” ledger at the NY FED. Same
for any other central bank. No one needs the eurodollar system for
macroeconomic liquidity management.</p><h3 id=secured><a class=anchor href=#secured title='Anchor for: Secured?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Secured?</h3><p>No.</p><p>Similar to a Euroyen or &ldquo;&ldquo;Europeso&rdquo; (if there were such a thing), you would
not have central bank or other government insured deposits, making these
&ldquo;euro-currencies&rdquo; more risky to hold.</p><p>The social status of &ldquo;eurodollar&rdquo; is thus largely fictional, and is leaning
on the &ldquo;US dollar&rdquo; for psychological support.</p><p>People still seem to believe these tokens have intrinsic value and are
somehow metaphorically &ldquo;dug up out of the ground.&rdquo; But as they say, if a
myth persists it can be materially effective. e witness this in complete
inverted terms with the Samuelson myth of the &ldquo;need&rdquo; to keep the public
ignorant of MMT. You know, the whole: &ldquo;If people understood the government
creates currency by fiat then the government would start spending like a drunken sailor and we&rsquo;d have hyperinflation!&rdquo;</p><p>Well dear Sirs, if the government caused hyperinflation by spending on hiring
people to do nice things, then that&rsquo;d be a darned good thing. For starters, a billionaire&rsquo;s hoard of &ldquo;$&rdquo; from a decade ago would be reduced to pennies
(in real terms).</p><p>There really is no real economic purpose for these euro-currencies. In many
ways I view them as similar to cryptocurrencies, because there is no authority
promising to redeem them, and so their intrinsic values is zero. Like baseball
cards. Unlike postage stamps (you can redeem a postage stamp for postal
delivery, if not for tax credits.)</p><h3 id=is-it-like-fractional-reserve-banking><a class=anchor href=#is-it-like-fractional-reserve-banking title='Anchor for: Is it like Fractional Reserve Banking?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Is it like Fractional Reserve Banking?</h3><p>No.</p><p>Traditional textbook description of &ldquo;fractional reserve banking&rdquo; does not
accurately describe how <em>either</em> US bank credit is created today, nor does
it apply in the same way to the eurodollar system.</p><h3 id=us-bank-credit-creation-is-not-reserve-constrained><a class=anchor href=#us-bank-credit-creation-is-not-reserve-constrained title='Anchor for: US Bank Credit Creation is Not Reserve-Constrained.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>US Bank Credit Creation is Not Reserve-Constrained</h3><p>In the modern US banking system, banks do <strong>not</strong> lend out existing deposits
nor are they constrained by the amount of reserves they hold. Instead, banks
create deposits &ldquo;ex nihilo&rdquo; (from nothing) when they make loans. They only
need to ensure they have enough reserves to meet settlement obligations and
regulatory requirements, which, since March 2020, have been set to zero for
transaction accounts by the Federal Reserve. If additional reserves
are needed, banks can obtain them after the fact (ex post) from the interbank
market or the central bank.</p><p>The key constraint for US banks is <strong>creditworthiness of the borrower</strong> and
the bank’s own capital requirements, not the level of reserves on hand.</p><hr><p>I think this covers the basics, for more depth it might be useful to write
a little bit on the history and some operational details.</p><h2 id=issuance-origins-and-convertibility><a class=anchor href=#issuance-origins-and-convertibility title='Anchor for: Issuance, Origins, and Convertibility.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Issuance, Origins, and Convertibility</h2><p><strong>Who Issues Eurodollars?</strong></p><p>Eurodollars are US dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside the
United States or in offshore branches of US banks. These deposits are not
subject to US banking regulations and are created by foreign banks through
the process of credit creation—essentially, they are &ldquo;loaned into existence&rdquo;
via the same fractional reserve banking practices as domestic dollars
(my account here is an MMT analysis, see <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar target=_blank>wikipedia</a>
or <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp target=_blank>Investopedia</a>
for other &mdash; potentially slightly erroneous &mdash; orthodox accounts).</p><p>Thus, the only issuers of eurodollars are banks (and sometimes non-bank
financial institutions) that are licensed to accept dollar deposits outside
the US There is no central authority or state entity that issues eurodollars;
they exist as promises by these banks to pay US dollars, not as liabilities
of the US government or Federal Reserve.</p><p><strong>Origins of the Eurodollar System</strong></p><p>The eurodollar system originated in the aftermath of World War II, when
large amounts of US dollars flowed into Europe through mechanisms like the
Marshall Plan and international trade surpluses. European entities,
including governments and corporations, preferred to keep their dollar
holdings in European banks rather than repatriate them to the US.
The first eurodollar accounts were often established to shield dollar assets
from potential US government seizure, as in the case of the Soviet Union
and Communist China during the early Cold War. Thus, the initial stock
of eurodollars was indeed US dollars, physically or legally held offshore.</p><p>The
[Wikipedia entry on the eurodollar](<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar target=_blank>wikipedia</a>
is fairly reliable as a source of much of this history, and as
far as I can tell not too controversial on the histroy.</p><p><strong>Are Eurodollars Now Decoupled from US Dollar Deposits?</strong></p><p>Over time, the eurodollar system evolved from merely holding surplus US
dollars offshore to a system where offshore banks create new
dollar-denominated deposits through lending, independent of any direct
inflow of physical US dollars. Today, eurodollars are largely &ldquo;decoupled&rdquo;
from the original stock of physical US dollars; they are created as book
entries by offshore banks, just as domestic US banks create dollar deposits
through lending. The eurodollar market is now a vast,
self-sustaining network of dollar-denominated liabilities and assets, not
simply a pool of redeposited US cash.</p><p>However, <em>more importantly</em> as I remarked earlier, the eurodollar system is
entirely a rich guys game, and decoupled from all working class interests.
The government does not need eurodollar systems in order to drive full
employment. The sole driver of full employment in non-ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs is
government policy decision making, not &ldquo;finding the money&rdquo;.</p><p>Having eurodollars floating around the ledgers does absolutely nothing to
diminish the government capacity to run full employment policy, and if
expanded eurodollar credit was actually causing some inflation it would
still not diminish the government capacity. Inflation is not a
real constraint for the government, it is a psychological constraint, and
so can be removed by a mysterious process called <em>thinking</em>.</p><p><strong>Are Eurodollars &ldquo;Backed&rdquo; by Anything?</strong></p><p>From an MMT perspective, the key distinction is that only the US government
(via the Federal Reserve) can issue the dollars necessary to pay taxes or settle payments to the US state. Eurodollars are promises by foreign banks to pay US dollars, but these banks are not part of the Federal Reserve System and cannot directly access US central bank reserves. These banks may also run out of USD
reserves, and so can be at risk of needing to acquire USD through their own borrowings. Which begs the question why any one bothers?</p><p>As the history seems to record, the Europenas simply perhaps do not trust
US banks to keep the deposits secure. This is slightly mad, since no one of
decent repute has ever had a US bank default on a deposit guarantee. But
there is sometimes little rational sense in accounting for the psychology
of the ultra-rich. You can tell them there is no risk in holding accounts
in US banks, but they have toe power to act as if things are otherwise.
(Though as do we all! I can swap my US dollars for NZD, if I am prepared
to suffer the transaction fee.)</p><p>Therefore, eurodollars are not really &ldquo;backed&rdquo; by a promise of redemption by
the US state. Their value rests on the ability and willingness of the issuing
bank to convert them into actual US dollars if demanded, typically by settling
through correspondent accounts with US banks. In times of stress, the risk
is that eurodollar holders may not be able to redeem at par, introducing
credit and liquidity risk absent from domestic US dollar deposits.</p><p><strong>Are Eurodollars Directly Convertible to USD for Payments to the US Government?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p>Eurodollars are not directly convertible to US dollars for settling payments
to the US government. To do so, a eurodollar deposit must be converted into
a US bank deposit—typically via a correspondent banking relationship &mdash; before
it can be used to pay taxes or settle with the US Treasury. Only deposits
within the US banking system, backed by Federal Reserve reserves, can be
used for such payments. There is no legal or institutional guarantee that
a eurodollar can always be converted to a US dollar at par, especially in
periods of financial stress.</p><h2 id=table-eurodollars-vs-us-bank-dollars><a class=anchor href=#table-eurodollars-vs-us-bank-dollars title='Anchor for: Table: Eurodollars vs. US Bank Dollars.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Table: Eurodollars vs. US Bank Dollars</h2><div class=scroll tabindex=0><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Eurodollars (Offshore USD)</th><th>US Bank Dollars (Onshore USD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Issuer</td><td>Foreign banks/offshore US banks</td><td>US banks (regulated by Fed)</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory regime</td><td>Not subject to US Fed regulations</td><td>Subject to US Fed regulations</td></tr><tr><td>Backed by State?</td><td>No (not redeemable by US state)</td><td>Yes (Fed liabilities, insured)</td></tr><tr><td>Use for US tax payments</td><td>No (must convert to US deposit)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Redemption guarantee</td><td>By issuing bank only</td><td>By US state (FDIC, Fed)</td></tr><tr><td>Creation mechanism</td><td>Credit creation (loans)</td><td>Credit creation (loans)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=summary><a class=anchor href=#summary title='Anchor for: Summary.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Summary</h2><ul><li>Only banks (and some non-banks) outside the US banking system issue
