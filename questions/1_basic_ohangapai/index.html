.
If any economy does not satisfy these conditions then it is not necessarily well described by MMT, but MMT might still be useful with a few tweaks.
An example would be when a nation runs a fixed exchange rate policy.
They can always <em>choose</em> to move to floating exchange rate, but if they choose not to, then their fiscal policy space is severely reduced compared to a proper MMT economy.</p><p>Almost all post-Keynesian, Neoclassical and New Keynesian analysis implicitly adopts fixed exchange rate thinking, and so will not be correct according to MMT.</p><p>For example, under fixed exchange rates a government will have a deficit constraint (aka. fiscal injection limit), but what the constraint is exactly will be impossible to compute, because it depends upon microeconomics and resource capacity. The point is that full resource capacity cannot be used when a nation fixes their exchange rate, they may be forced to tolerate involuntary unemployment, while a proper MMT system never has to tolerate any unemployment.
There is no inflation constraint in an MMT system when a floating exchange rate is adopted.
Later questions will explain why.
There is however, <em>always</em> a <strong>real resource constraint</strong> &mdash; that&rsquo;s just physics.</p><p>Post-Keynesians think there is an inflation constraint.
They are wrong.
They would be correct if a fixed exchange rate was applied.</p><p>For roughly the same reason, post-Keynesians think a large government debt is a problem, since &ldquo;debt servicing&rdquo; has to be &ldquo;funded&rdquo; by raising taxes.
(What they mean by &ldquo;funded&rdquo; is that there is a need to keep the exchange rate fixed &mdash; so it is bad language framing.)
This is of course incorrect in a proper MMT system.
The government operating a floating exchange rate has no debt constraint, they have <em>only</em> real resource constraints.</p><p>MMT tells us that &ldquo;debt servicing&rdquo; for a government sovereign is nothing but <em>typing numbers into bank accounts</em> of Treasury bond holders.
There is no constraint here other than psychological, or political.
Governments can refuse to type in those numbers.
Then the bond holders are defrauded, the governments defaults.
<em>Why would a government choose to voluntarily default on such debt obligations?</em>
There is no <em>good</em> reason other than to either, (i) defend a gold supply (inapplicable today post Breton-Woods), or (ii) defend a desired exchange rate.</p><p>But otherwise post-Keynesians are very close to MMT in all other respects on macroeconomics.</p><p>Neoclassicals and New Keynesians have far more diverging views other than just obsessing on fixed exchange rates, they for instance still have completely idiotic thinking about money supply, marginal product of labour, marginal cost of production, and the champion of all bone-headed macroeconomic thinking &mdash; the NAIRU (a total and utter myth).
There is a NAIRU only if governments refuse to hire the unemployed. But most governments are prepared to hire plenty of people who cannot find employment in the private sector, so the NAIRU is at best just an artefact of stupid government policy (governments who think (or act as if) the private sector is supposed to be responsible for full employment).</p><p>Today Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and the USA are all examples of MMT systems. This does not mean their politicians understand MMT, and typically they will not, so bad policy choices that MMT would tell you are harmful to workers can often result &mdash; this is no fault of the MMT system that exists in these countries.</p><p>The analogy would be like playing Football in a system that is governed by Rugby, or even worse, it could be in the USA a lot like trying to play NFL with the rules of baseball, completely messed up government policy, for no good reason other than ignorance of the monetary system.
Under such political conditions one cannot blame MMT for any economic crises, the blame has to fall upon the decision makers who utterly fail to understand ther own nation&rsquo;s monetary operations.</p><p><a href=./>Next chapter (TBC)</a><br><a href=../0_introduction>Previous chapter (Introduction)</a><br><a href=/questions/>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
