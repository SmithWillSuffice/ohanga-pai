The myth is that <em>has</em> has to be repaid.
But there is a second sub-myth associated with this one, which is about the tax return that &ldquo;pays for&rdquo; the rising government deficit.</p><p><strong>Myth 2</strong> is the Ricardian Equivalence fallacy.
It is a false myth because it implicitly uses the QTM myth, that increasing money supply causes price inflation.
We already debunked this in the <a href=../4_inflation_myths#what-is-the-qtm-myth>chapter on inflation,</a>
but below we can add a few more nuances.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at these in more detail.</p><h2 id=the-myths-about-the-deficit-pay-back><a class=anchor href=#the-myths-about-the-deficit-pay-back title='Anchor for: The Myths about the Deficit pay-back.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Myths about the Deficit pay-back</h2><h3 id=government-deficits-accumulate-to-government-debt-----true><a class=anchor href=#government-deficits-accumulate-to-government-debt-----true title='Anchor for: Government deficits accumulate to government debt &mdash; true.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Government deficits accumulate to government debt &mdash; true</h3><p>Government debt however, is held in the form of each of these money forms:</p><ul><li>cash in wallets,</li><li>bank deposits,</li><li>Treasury bonds.</li></ul><p>Treasury bonds are functionally like government guaranteed bank term deposits, they promise interest payments.
Cash and bank deposits that are not being spent are demand leakages, so are not causing inflation, and thus not causing any higher tax return.</p><p>The government does not need to take back this cash and those bank deposits.
The government has already issued the money that was used to buy bonds
(it was formerly cash or bank deposit, swapped now for an interest bearing Treasury security).</p><p>Most people think of &ldquo;national debt&rdquo; as only the Treasury bonds &mdash; why?
Because these are the only forms of government deficit that the government promises to pay interest on, so is an &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; over and above the obligation to merely accept the currency back as payment (redemption) for tax liabilities.</p><h3 id=rising-government-debt-means-higher-tax-return-----true><a class=anchor href=#rising-government-debt-means-higher-tax-return-----true title='Anchor for: Rising government debt means higher tax return &mdash; true.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Rising government debt means higher tax return &mdash; true</h3><p>For most economies, when the government debt rises there is more currency, but it is not always being spent.
But let&rsquo;s suppose it is being spent (so not all held as bonds).
Then the increase financial activity in the government&rsquo;s tax credits will <em>automatically</em> increase tax return.</p><p>But this is automatic, no new extra taxes are needed.
Sales tax and FIA tax for example is sufficient. But those are regressive taxes.
Suppose there was just a flat land tax per acre of unoccupied land, or per cubic metre of occupied real estate.</p><p>There is no &ldquo;burden&rdquo; on the government in accepting back their own currency for payment of these taxes.
They always redeem! Why would they not?</p><p>The burden is on the non-government sector.
But this is a good thing.
The myth is that this is a bad thing.</p><p>If the economy is booming the non-government sector is dong well, and any poverty and unemployment is dealt with by distribution policies, not monetary or tax policy.
So the increased automatic tax return has the function of automatically helping stabilize prices, this is a good thing, not a bad thing.</p><p>This Warren Mosler&rsquo;s Seventh of the <em><a href=/ohanga-pai/pdf/Mosler_2010_Seven.Deadly.Innocent.Frauds.of.Economics_original.pdf>Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy</a></em> :</p><blockquote><p>No. 7: &ldquo;<em>Rising Government debt today means higher tax return tomorrow.</em>&rdquo;
This is true.
The myth is that it is a bad thing.</p></blockquote><h2 id=myths-about-the-deficit-not-being-stimulus><a class=anchor href=#myths-about-the-deficit-not-being-stimulus title='Anchor for: Myths about the deficit not being stimulus.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Myths about the deficit not being stimulus</h2><p>I already gave the one-liner on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence target=_blank>Ricardian Equivalence.</a>
It&rsquo;s a false myth.</p><p>The idea is that government deficits are &ldquo;not stimulus,&rdquo; because increasing the money supply
(which is what a net government deficit does) will just increase prices,
if no taxes are raised, so the purchasing power of the extra dollars lowers to adjust to the status quo, and the net effect is just a temporary disruption in the market.
That&rsquo;s the idea of Ricardian Equivalence. It is a false idea.</p><p>The popular economics reasoning behind Ricardian Equivalence is a deification of the average person with market power (someone who has a lot of currency):
which is that they take a look at the government deficit, and factor this into their consumption choices: to hold on to cash or to spend.</p><p>The mythical idea is that such rational people we all are, and that we go on a short spending spree, but then defer our consumption if we see a rising government deficit because we think this will inflate prices soon, so we wait until we starve or deplete what we got from our spree before making our consumption in the future once inflation comes down &mdash; or something like this.
(Interest rates also will play a minor role in this, to the extent the interest rate is the penalty for holding cash rather than bonds or spending it.)</p><p>Total bullsh*t of course.
No one thinks and acts this way except a neoclassical economist, and even then, only in their dreams.</p><p><strong>The reality</strong> is that prices are determined by relative value stories, and so,</p><ol><li>government deficits targeted to move production from wasteful sectors to productive sectors violate Ricardian Equivalence, meaning they are direct stimulus.</li><li>Other demand leakages (savings) can be insatiable, and they obviate the need for tax return to stabilize prices, so <em>provided</em> there are people with insatiable desires to save, Ricardian Equivalence is again violated, and government net spending can be a great stimulus, if spent wisely on real production.</li></ol><p>Having stated these points the burden of proof is on economists who still think Ricardian Equivalence is effective.
For any given country it <em>might</em> be the case Ricardian Equivalence will apply, but that will only be the case if their economy is at full employment, or has reached some other bottleneck.</p><p>if you do not like this theoretical reasoning, then I urge you to take a look at any reasonably healthy economy during war time.
Their governments always increase the government deficit, and it is a massive stimulus.</p><p>The &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of this is a shift of production from say farm implements to missiles, guns and ammo.
But it is still a stimulus, and can be empirically checked.</p><p>The tax &ldquo;pay for&rdquo; is automatic, as per Mosler&rsquo;s 7th of the Seven Deadly Frauds.
Governments get the war time stimulus needed without needing to raise taxes, provided the existing tax rate is progressive.</p><p>In major wars, like WW-2, governments typically have to do a bit more than rely on automatic stabilising tax return, they typically need to withdraw demand from the sectors that the war effort is borrowing real resources from, such as labour, non-war machinery production (automobiles, and other equipment) and oil.
The point is not to deprive the economy of those goods, but rather to shift them away
from private sector production into the war effort production.</p><p>You do not have to agree that this is a god type of stimulus! That all depends on
the reason and cause and justification for the war effort (usually there is no moral
justification, unless it is purely defensive).</p><p>Yet everything just said can also apply to non-war effort, like greening the
energy sector of the economy or providing free healthcare and education. The
perennial war on ignorance. Governments almost always out-bid the private sector for
hiring of teachers, but not well-enough, there are still plenty of useful
teachers who remain under-employed (which can mean simply under-paid).</p><p>The governments withdraw this demand with a mix of polices, some fees, a lot of war bonds, and a lot of rationing, and some price fixing along with subsidies.
So there is a weak Ricardian effect here, but it is not anything any rational agent can foresee, since no one knows when a war will end.</p><p>(It is debatable whether modern neoliberal governments understand any of this,
they probably do not, so if they get into a major war they&rsquo;ll probably cause hyper-inflation, until the war stops.
MMT tells them they do not need to tolerate hyperinflation during a pandemic or a war, but will they listen?
Probably not, they&rsquo;re ideologues who do not respect the reality of monetary systems.)</p><h3 id=keynes-knew-this-already-before-mmt><a class=anchor href=#keynes-knew-this-already-before-mmt title='Anchor for: Keynes knew this already before MMT.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Keynes knew this already before MMT</h3><p>In the <a href=http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368KeynesOpenLetFDRtable.pdf target=_blank>letter to FDR,</a>
Keynes put it fairly plainly:</p><blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, therefore, an increase of output cannot occur unless by the operation of one or other of three factors.
(1) Individuals must be induced to spend more out of their existing incomes;
or (2) the business world must be induced, either by increased confidence in the prospects
or by a lower rate of interest,
to create additional current incomes in the hands of their employees,
which is what happens when either the working or the fixed capital of the country is being increased;
or (3) public authority must be called in aid to create additional current incomes through the expenditure of borrowed or printed money.
In bad times the first factor cannot be expected to work on a sufficient scale.
The second factor will come in as the second wave of attack on the slump after the tide has been turned by the expenditures of public authority.
It is, therefore, only from the third factor that we can expect the initial major impulse.</p></blockquote><p>Euro economist <a href=https://econoblog101.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/discussion-with-ben-fine-about-keynes-and-keynesianism/ target=_blank>Dirk Ehnts</a>
put it like this:</p><blockquote><p>A bit further down the text Keynes says that monetary policy should aim at &ldquo;maintenance of cheap and abundant credit and in particular the reduction of the long-term rates of interest.&rdquo; Clearly Keynes thinks about combinations of interest rates and levels of government spending that lead to full employment, but it is government spending that is of utmost importance.</p></blockquote><p>Another way to put this is that government net spending provides the collateral whereby firms <em>in the macro</em> can be confident bank credit they use for investment can be paid back by households without a private sector debt-deflation collapse.</p><p>Or, <strong><em>a growing economy needs a growing net money supply.</em></strong></p><p><a href=../6_interest_rate_myths>Next chapter (Interest Rate Myths)</a><br><a href=../4_inflation_myths>Previous chapter (Inflation Myths)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Questions TOC</a></p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
