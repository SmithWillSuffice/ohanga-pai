Preparing for a mmm-0.3 model, with Godley Tables, I wanted to also take a 
breif excursion into fetching empirical data, specifically for New Zealand, 
since I do not see much point i =n making the effort to model the banking 
operations without some realistic empirical inputs. 

This turns out to be painful, since NZ does not have a nice facility like 
the St Louuis FED. In fact at presetn I get some betetr quality NZ data 
from the FRED.


### Refinement--0.3


**Issue 1.** 
We'd rather not write an arbitrary Investment function, right? The level 
of investment should be determined by the interest rates. But in a 
government centred economy --- like every nation today --- the interest 
rate is a policy parameter. So we can just look-it-up from the RBNZ or 
FRED or wherever. The banker only needs a credit-worthy customer. This is 
good for us, it means we do not need to solve some awful market equilibrium 
problem.


**Issue 2.** While I think the Two-Sector model is worth refining, and is 
a good one to use, it does not reveal much about the all important aspects 
of a nominal "democracy", which is the Firm vs Worker conflict. It is a 
vitally nasty bit of the present neoliberal capitalist system. Bosses do 
not need to work to eat, Workers do. So,


> <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; margin: 10px 0px;">The labour market is an unfair game.</div>

One might even say grossly unfair, and it is not even a game, it is 
life & death stuff.  Hence important to model you might think?

I do so think.

Unfortunately, the painfulness of model complexity starts to rare its 
ugly time-sucking head. I need Godley Tables at this stage if for no 
other reason that to avoid $\pm$ sign mistakes. But also to ensure 
stock-flow consistency. 

Our Model is now **(Three+1)**-Sector Model (sounds a bit Minkowski! Have 
we gone relativistic?), 
but still closed, or if you prefer:

> **Workers** = All workers domestic and foreign, but wages in NZD.  
**Firms**  = All firms domestic and foreign, dealing in NZD.  
**Government** = NZ Government.  
**Banks** = agents of the state, but still in the Godley Tables.

So the Bank sector is the "+1".

This way we do not need to worry about imports and exports, they are taken 
into account.

Although our Government does not explicitly insure _all_ bank deposits, 
they have a track record in propping up commercial banks, so _for all 
intents and purposes_ the banks are in the Government Sector, which is why 
I'd call this a (3+1) model.


### Investment (3+1) Sectors

The investment function can now be more complicated. We considered 
split private debt + loans. If we had two sectors suffering different 
interest rates they would just split the term into Loan and Debts,
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D) \& = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_d D + i_g D_g\\\\
\text{into},\qquad \mathcal{I} \&= \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D + i_g D_g \\\\
\end{align*}
$$
where $F_L$ are the Firm loans, and $F_D$ are the Firm debts. But this 
would very soon almost necessitate introducing Godley Tables to keep the 
loan and debt ledgers balanced, which means banking. I want to delay this 
modelling for now, so we will bookmark it as something to do.

As before, $D_g$ is government debt, so is the interest-earning asset of 
the Firms and Workers now. Though I was not sure if all of $D_g$ should go 
to Investment. Probably we should split this using a savings propensity, 
$s_g$. Then,
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta \mathcal{I} \&\sim  (1 -s_g) i_g D_g \\\\
\Delta S \&\sim  s_g i_G D_g
\end{align*}
$$
and so,
$$
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D_g) = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D +
(1-s_g) i_gD_g 
$$

OK, but this means we have to put $s_gi_GD_g$ somewhere else. Obviously in 
Firm and Worker deposits, $F_D$, $W_D$. But how much of the share? Should 
we just use the monopoly parameter $\sigma$ from before? Or add another 
knob to twiddle? Well, this depends on thee size of the firm I guess, so 
it will require a new parameter. But is is something we should have 
empirical data to guide us.

From the [IMF datamapper](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/NZL) 
we can get $D_g$ and the interest paid on $D_g$. 
But not the sector breakdown, for which we might need to dig into RBNZ data.
But in lieu of that, there is a split of all 
"private debt, loans and securities". That might include Tsy securities, 
I am not sure, but the indicator or ratio aught to be a fair proxy for the 
share of government interest-income.

| Year | Debt, loans, securities | % GDP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023 | Private | 161.32 |
|  | Household | 91.61 |
|  | Nonfinancial |  60.71 |

Let's conjure up a symbol for this ratio, say 
$$
\sigma_G = 0.37
$$
for "share of government interest-income (to firms)".

**Note:** I will need to automate downloading these indicators. They are 
our "weather data". I have not fetched from the IMF before. But is seems a simple API, just a URL that gets a JSON file, [instructions here](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/help). For the indicator codes see: <https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1/indicators>
```
TODO:
Automate these downloads (annual cron job). 

# "Total stock of loans and debt securities issued by households and nonfinancial corporations as a share of GDP."

# "Total stock of loans and debt securities issued by households as a share of GDP."
https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1//HH_LS/NZL
```
Since the IMF table is two years behind, but the variation smooth, I think 
a simple cubic spline extrapolation is ok.

The ratio has changed over time:

{{<PVD_LS_NZ>}}


#### Other Deposit and Loan Data (could be good)

Let's not clog up this chapter. I have another chapter on how to get 
some NZ economic data.  A few series we will like are bank deposits, 
loans, and money aggregates. The RBNZ publishes these as xls 
spreadsheets. I will write some python scripts for retrieving these, which 
I will test over on the [data chapter](/ohanga-pai/empirical/100_00_nzecon/#bank-data-rbnz). 

There are lots of nice looking series there, like Consumption (**M2** table) 
and Investment (**M3** table), and **M9**=labour market. **M5**=GDP. For 
our Godley Tables: bank liabilities=**S40**, which used to be **C17** 
before 2017 I think? and the bank assets=**S34** used to be **S9**.



### Justifying No Foreign Sector

As regards impact on the NZ economy, we are only concerned with NZ$. 
But all trade balances can be converted to NZD, and New Zealand operates 
a floating exchange rate. So we care not about foreign flows of finance. 
They are part of the NZ economy at large.


**What we Lose?**  
With this **Three+1** model we cannot model the impact of foreign capital flows 
on the government policy and price level. This is a major flaw in the event 
of a foreign monopolist marking-up their price, especially today Crude Oil.

OK, but we'd have to manually adjust the Foreign Import price variable 
anyway, it's not a market reaction function easily modelled. Thus I'm going 
to put off modelling the Foreign Sector and the exchange rate 
entirely until much later on.

Also, note we do not have a single exchange rate, the NZD floats with 
respect to all currencies. So this external sector modelling truly is 
a nightmare. It's just worth noting what analysis we lose as a result.
* No response to forex movements.
* No response to import prices, especially crude oil.
* No response to capital flows.
So we will have to try to capture such variables in some other fashion, by 
using empirical data, just like the Meteorological Office uses weather 
balloon and satellite data as inputs to revise weather forecasts.

One way to kludge this is to have an arbitrary factor adjustment in the 
price level that does an "all-in-one" adjustment to all three above 
factors. Supposing we do this by just looking at the CPI, or PCE, then 
our model would be empirical and would be only "good" to a few weeks out.


### Government Debt


To model government bonds, or $D_g$ we could simplify a bit, since 
we really only need to increase the effects of $i_B$ and $i_g$ to an 
equivalent effective $i^\ast_B$=interest 
on bank deposits. What I mean is,

> $i_B^\ast\cdot (F_D + W_D)$ is functionally the same as $i_B\cdot(F_D+W_D) + i_g\cdot D_g$.

This is an extreme form of what Mosler says: banks are agents of the State.

This is because it is functionally the same whenever the 
government insures bank deposits, which maybe despite neoliberal threats, is 
typically the case these days post-GFC. The government bond is only 
different in that it gets booked as "Government Debt" rather than 
Bank Liabilities. In a stable country like NZ there is a legal and 
psychological difference, but no practical difference (except in behavioural 
response functions, which of course do matter, but we will not worry since we have 
no clue what the behaviours will be, yet).

The psychological difference is that government bonds are considered more 
secure, less risky. All the risk is at the margins for traders, and who 
cares for them? Not me. They're not the people feuling the real economy. 
()Actually we might care, since they are the parasites. But I will care later.)

Use my PDFLaTeX notes.

I think that's it, I think, for `mmm_0_3`. Try and see if it compiles and runs.

**Exercise:** Have a think about the need for a Foreign Sector? Is there 
a need?

Hint: The MMT lens is perfectly good for "highly macro", meaning we can 
have Two Sector Balance, just Government and Non-Government. What is the 
loss in using a Two Sector model?

**Reflections:** In MMT unemployment is _defined_ by:

> **(Unemployment)** _People seeking to exchange their labour or goods 
for tax credits._

But wat... that means we do not need a Foreign Sector. Foreigners needing our government scorepoints are unemployed in our currency, which is a waste 
of human lives (or at least some sort of dopiness needing elimination --- 
maybe the Aussies borrowed some NZD off us, for whatever silly reason). 

Unemployment of NZ dollars is pointless, so we can really regard foreigners 
as part of our economy, they are "Kiwis who do not live in NZ and do 
not own NZ things." You can add,  "... and who do not pay NZ taxes." 
Big deal, whoop-dee-doo.

What's the downside then?

Obviously we will not have any iodea about international fincial flows, 
and FOREX and sop forth can be a source of parasitic wasteful human 
activity, so it might be nice to use  a Three Sector model. But if we are 
not too worried about those flows, then we should not care.

## MMM-1.0 --- Slightly More Monetary

The next job is the modify `mmm_0_3` to include an explicit Foreign Sector
and a Job Guarantee.  Maybe I will go for the JG first. The Job Guarantee 
is the superior automatic stabilizer. We want to understand that this is 
indeed "as advertised".

If not? Well, then either our model is bad, or our model is good but 
the JG does not function as advertised. That'd be important to know!

I see it as a model test. You may not? As a model test the JG works by 
**pure logic**, so if our model does not produce an automatic stabilizer 
effect then our model will be wrong, and will need debugging.

Once we have confidence in the model, then the last task (for this course 
of study) will be to compare policies, like full JG versus full UBI.






















## Getting to Pro Models

Just a quick note on what to do if you are a salaried professional, but 
have no experience in building ODES models.

1. Take the Toy model and add whatever features you think necessary for 
more realism, which will not be computational no-gos; and remove bits of 
the model you think are superfluous.
2. Fetch relevant real world data for the government of interest. My minimum 
set currently is: (1) Unemployment (U6); (2) wage share; (3) output, 
(4) price level (CPI is only a rough approximant). Then we need the policy 
parameters: (5) interest rates (at least two); (6) tax rate (effective average).
3. Use parameter fitting tools, like Monte Carlo nonlinear regressions to 
get fits to your other model parameters and structural constants.
4. Needless to say, if you fitting was for 2023-Q1 data, then your 
testing needs to be for 2024-Q1, and then your forecasting can be made 
for 2025-Q1.

### Time Periods

I have no idea yet, but I think it'd be unwise to run an MMT model for 
more than a quarter of the next year. But the idea would be the model has all 
four quarterly parameter adjustments. So we'd be able to in a single 
run integrate the ODE for 12 months. Any longer is mere **policy analysis** 
(the "what if's"), not **not forecasting**.


### Fetching Data

The USA is the best studied case, since the FRED have all the empirical data 
you would need to get a nice fit. Maybe also the EU as a whole? Maybe also 
the UK? But I have not looked into other nations.  Fetching time series 
from the OECD and BIS portals can be automated, just not as smoothly as 
with the FRED.

For NZ I could not find good Treasury Statements except form the NZ Treasury
XLS spreadsheets. StatsNZ is too cumbersome, and does not have the Treasury 
data in any convenient form I can find.

If you want to develop some neural net predictors in parallel with ODES 
models then banking sector data can be useful, but again our RBNZ does not 
have a seamless portal for fetching this data from what I can tell.

Part of the problem here is that I am only doing this as an unpaid 
volunteer, working "for the community" (I am my own boss, and I raise my 
pay by 100% every year). If some pro time were devoted to the effort then 
perhaps we could build a nice MMT data portal for NZ.
