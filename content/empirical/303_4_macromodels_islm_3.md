* Write-up ISLM scenerio studies.
* Figure out some metric(s) for comparing with our other macromodels.

Basically we want to know for what the model can predict, how good is it?
An AIC score might be nice too. 














## Last Word

You might notice the inordinate amount of work we had to do to fetch empirical
data to get the parameters for our IS and LM curves. But the ISLM model only
spits out a static equilibrium analysis, and only gives us two outputs, Income
and Interest rate. But (we will see later) we can use plain old econometric
forecasts or modern neural networks to better predict output $Y$ changes in
response to policy variable changes within reason. Is the ISLM model going to
really give us a good estimate for how $Y$ might respond to money supply or
investment variables? Let alone changes to public employment and welfare policy?
Impossible! 

This places into serious question whether there is _any_ use for an ISLM model
in informing good policy? 

The case seems extremely weak, or weak to completely backwards!

Our conclusion is that ISLM is hazardous to use as a predictive tool. It should
not even be taught in schools. 

Every ISLM model, or anything like it, should come with an obligatory warning
from the Surgeon General:

> **Caution:** This is a bullshit equilibria macroeconomic model, if
persistently used in policy it can damage the health of all of society. 
Possibly leading to extinction of your species.
