This section is for discussions (in article form) of theory and empirical research development. 

Contributors are welcome, but will need to submit through the [Contact](/contact/) form. 
Your article needs to be technical, not philosophical.

The [philosophy and questions section](/questions/) of this website goes through in a breezy way some of the concepts and possible avenues of research for the Ōhanga Pai community.

This section of articles gives you just a little taste of some projects I might be working on, time and *willing* collaborators permitting.
