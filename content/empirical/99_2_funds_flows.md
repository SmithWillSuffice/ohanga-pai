The second in the planned series on Macro Trading MMT (MT for short.)

## Sectoral Balances for Trading

Alan Longbon wrote an interesting [article on SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569870-the-white-house-fed-inflation-and-flow-of-funds-for-january-2023) 
which outlined his investment strategy, which is pretty simple and *highly* MMT informed.

> "My investment approach is very simple. I find countries with the highest and 
strongest macro-fiscal flows and low levels of private debt and invest in them using 
country ETFs and contract for difference (CFDs)I use functional finance and sectoral 
flow analysis of the national accounts of the nations I invest in."

He obviously doesn't publish his returns, but you cna easily imagine he could be often ahead of the market or the mythical 7%.

At MMT Macro Trader Douglas is going to get around to putting up a similar model on 
the Patreon page (or whatever platform he later migrates to permanently, to escape 
the Patreon.com hosting fees).

## Proving MMT

My own interest is in building a model for Longbon's CFD trades retrospectively, 
so not to make investments, but to track what one *would have gained historically* 
**_if_** one had been using the MMT informed strategy.

As I've written about elsewhere, [this is not "proof of MMT"](/ohanga-pai/blog/10_proof_of_x/) --- but it is Bayesian style evidence in favour of the MMT principles:

1. Governments operating fiat currencies and floating exchange rates have no fiscal constraints (other than self-imposed).
2. They have real resource constraints.
3. Sectoral balances sum to zero (otherwise an accountant made a mistake).

What Alan's strategy amounts to really is finding the governments who have the fewer 
self-imposed constraints, then estimating the relative strengths of the currencies. 
The CDF's (contracts for difference) and ETFs (exchange traded funds) --- 
[some explainers here](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/trading-guides/cfd-vs-etf) or [here](http://investpost.org/stocks/what-s-the-difference-between-an-etf-and-a-cfd/)--- are 
these days open for small retail investors. So there one has an opportunity to either 
make some decent investments for retirement, or provide empirical evidence in favour 
of MMT hypotheses as opposed to the Null Hypotheses like: "loanable funds is the 
operational reality."

Again, let me repeat, as I've [written elsewhere](/ohanga-pai/blog/10_proof_of_x/), 
you're a bit dull if you think such evidence is needed to "prove MMT", because MMT 
makes no claim on how funds markets will move, all you need to "prove MMT" is a look 
at the law of the land. Unfortunately that means reading legal Acts of parliaments, 
not time series charts.

How funds markets move can be deduced from the MMT principles, but only with a whole 
bunch of other assumptions.
The "test" of MMT in this case is more convoluted, since those additional assumptions 
then also ned to be tested. Just curve fitting to data can be done with any old 
nonsense model (DSGE) provided with enough free parameters (order up your Ptolemaic 
epicycles).
