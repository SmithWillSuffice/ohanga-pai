This is a new chapter as fo 2024, inserted in a rough pedagogical order.

## The Mosler Frame

The original MMT contribution the 
[The Bond Story](../001_basic_ohangapai#the-bond-story) concerned 
pure monetary operations between central bank and Treasury.

When the government spends it adds to reserves. Banks can statutorily 
lend reserves, and may seek to do so to gain interest, but if the 
government spending result sin overall excess reserves for the whole system, 
then the interbank lending rate drops rapidly to zero. A good thing, you 
might say.

However, some central bankers dislike zero interest rates (for false reasons, 
but that is another story) and so in order to "offset operating factors"
the central bank will either sell bonds to drain the reserves or pay interest 
on the reserves so the banks do not mind holding excess reserves.

Total smoke & mirrors. But that's what they do in central banking for the 
bullsh1t jobs maintenance of employment of professional accounts clerks.

### No Fixed Exchange Rate

We no longer have a fixed exchange rate nor a commodity peg in New Zealand, 
we operate a floating exchange rate. This means government bond operations and 
the Debt management Office are anachronisms.

All NZ government spending can be directly "monetized" by simply instructing 
the RBNZ to credit accounts when the government makes payments.

In the old days government bonds may have been useful for purposes of 
pass-through inflation control, which is a political realpolitik. People do 
not like to see inflation even though there are no bad economic consequences, 
and inflation can even be beneficial for the poorest (in the inflation comes 
from rising lowest real wages).)"

You might ask when did the lowest real wage ever rise? Not often is the 
answer. But governments have full power to make that happen if they choose. 
It is just a policy choice.

OK, but _given_ we do not want to get voted out of office, even if the 
political psychology is false, the government may desire to keep inflation 
stable, and in the low digits. This is a problem to manage if there is a 
fixed exchange rate or anything else the government promises to convert that 
it cannot create.

In the fixed exchange rate case the government effectively promises to swap 
NZD for other currencies, for if they do not, and exports are weak, then 
the exchange rate may deteriorate, and the government then faces unsavoury 
policy options for targeting the exchange rate, such as using unemployment to 
"discipline" labour. Including cutting back on government services. 
Both terrible socially destructive policies.

An alternative is to offer bonds, so that come consumption is forestalled, 
as well as demand for NZD rises, relative to other currencies and other 
assets. But this is also a terrible policy, since it amounts to a highly 
regressive basic income scheme. _Basic income but **only** for people who 
already have money, and in proportion to how much money they already have._


## The Mitchell Frame

Bill Mitchell alerted me (I was just reading his work, catching up) to the 
fact that he agrees with Warren, but has another way of explaining why 
government bond instruments exist.

It was already bad enough on a fixed exchange rate regime, where the only 
semi-reasonable policy options in the face of weakening exports was to offer 
rich folks free money, in the form of Treasury bonds.  Mitchell explains it 
is even worse than this!

To see why, we have to go beyond Warren Mosler's frame, and consider 
Realpolitik.  For a start, recall we have a floating exchange rate, so the 
pure monetary purpose for government bonds has completely disappeared. They 
are an anachronistic instrument that only fraudulent or ignorant central 
bankers and Treasury officials insist still be in place.  They can avoid 
disruptive overnight cash rate fluctuations${}^\dagger$ by simply permitting 
all banks clearing payments each day to have an interest free overdraft.

${}^\dagger$I always regard these "disruptions" as elitist concerns. But on 
occasion they could bleed over into the real economy and lead to banks 
wantonly charging their customers excessive fees, so generally we do not want 
unavoidable interbank payments clearing disruptions. It's like the playground 
bully. If a bigger bully hits them up, the little kids cop the punishment. 
Yeah, that's right, most people in "finance", banking, trading and economics 
are frickin' children. They rather lose $\\$$10,000 than 
gain $\\$$50,000 only to 
see their neighbour go up $\\$$20,000.

Mitchell explains that even if the central bankers and Treasury officials 
know this, there is still a further Neoliberal minded impulse for why they 
are happy to persist in perpetuating the myth of the need for the 
government to issue bonds to offset spending. 

It is pretty simple, and yet shocking:

> The neoliberals want to control government and the politicians, they 
want politicians to believe more government spending, such as to run full 
employment, will cause market havoc and "destroy the currency". 

The fake bond story is a perfect rhetorical vehicle for this, which the 
"financial" press eats up like hungry zombies feeding on the brains of the 
working class. Brain drain of Kiwis to Australia perhaps comprehensible --- 
but will not help those workers, the Aussie neoliberal elite zombie hoards 
are probably worse.

It is about power and control.

First of all though, you are entitled to a rotfl at: "It'll destroy 
the currency!" ðŸ¤£

... since you by now know exactly where the price level comes from, and 
where (insatiable) demand for the currency originates.

**For the serious suff:** 
The power elites appear to (whether ignorantly or knowingly out of malice) 
want to "reign in the government" to avoid any hope of prosperity for the 
poorest among the working class. We can call this class warfare, since that 
is what it is. Who of any compassion and loving kindness would not want to 
see the poorest workers lifted up in prosperity?  The answer is plenty of 
people, the neoliberal elites in particular. The oligarchs for another class.

If not, if these groups really want to see the poorest people lifted up out 
of poverty, then where is their charity? It cannot be found. So either they 
are incredibly dumb and ignorant, or they are engaging in class warfare, or 
they just could not give as stuff. 

There really is no other explanation for this mindset. Since 
as we noted the operational purpose for government bonds has disappeared.

The neoliberals and their oligarchs need the general public to have a fear 
of the **government debt** and need to make sure citizens and the mass media 
know the government debt is a terrible thing.  It is of course ostensibly the 
opposite of a terrible thing.

The government debt is nothing but all the dollars spent by the government 
that have not yet been used to pay taxes. It is the net private wealth held 
in the form of NZD balances of the non-government sector.

Non-ostensibly, the only major problem with a large and growing government 
debt is the make-up of the owners of the deposit and bond accounts who have 
most of the net government spending. Particularly the bond holders.

Most bond holders (other than the government itself, the RBNZ) 
are either institutional money manager funds, or wealthy people. They are 
getting the free basic income. The poorest workers are not.

The problem with government debt is not how large a sum it is, but how it 
is distributed. The Top Ten Percent have it all.


## Left Pocket

Note that if the RBNZ held 100% of the Treasury debt, that'd be perfect. The 
neoliberal zombies and former bond traders could cry all they like. It is 
the left pocket of government owing the right pocket. Yippee! Whoop-de-do. 

Revealing the farce that continued government bond operations are: 
complete pro-inflationary --- in the most regressive way --- useless waste of 
human time.
