## Q & A

**How exactly does the monetary payments and clearing system work in New Zealand?** <br>
<font style="color: palegreen">Same as everywhere else, the government 
marks-up bank accounts using a computer when it spends, and marks-down 
your bank account when you pay the tax due.</font>

Our central bank, the RBNZ, mediates inter-bank payments clearing, so your 
local supermarket does not have to care your bank is different to theirs.

**Is it signifantly different to other countries?** <br>
<font style="color: palegreen">No.</font>


**Does anyone at the RBNZ understand this?** <br>
<font style="color: palegreen">Yes.</font> <font style="color: tomato">A few.</font> 


**Does anyone in leadership power understand this?** <br>
<font style="color: tomato">No.</font> <font style="color: palegreen">Or mostly no.</font> 


**Does anyone at NZ Treasury understand this?** <br>
<font style="color: tomato">No.</font> 


**Do local councils and government departments really need accounts at Westpac or ANZ?**<br>
<font style="color: tomato">No.</font> <font style="color: palegreen">They 
could have accounts only at the RBNZ. It would make no significant operational 
difference, since they'd still be on a budget constraint. Just the pretense 
of being constrained by real 'gold' or 'tax payer counterfeit dollars' 
goes away.</font>


**Do local councils still need to impose rates and levies?**<br>
<font style="color: palegreen">Yes. For now, since the NZ central government 
is not block grant funding the councils, They should be block grant funding 
the counciks though --- to remove all the waste of effort fighitng the rate 
payers who are being gutted in order to fund scorepoint impoverished 
councils </font><font style="color: tomato">--- to eliminate the need for 
local council fees, fines and levies, which serve no 
useful public purpose.</font>


## Longer Discussion

This is from an email with Otago University researcher Morgan Edwards.
It's got the appropriate irreverence, but is perfectly accurate.

I asked Morgan about where I could find more "software layer" details. It is 
easy enough to read the Public Finance Act and other public banking statutes, 
but they do not explain how the software works.  My complaint was that I'd 
come across "very left-brain types" who like to point out the NZ Treasury always 
has a positive account balance _before_ it spends. Hence, 
the _very left-brained person_ may say, the government is always getting the 
NZD off the tax payer or the private banks through bond operations. 
The _very left-brain_ creatures are dead wrong! 


Here is Morgan's response: ---

---

I’ve attached Callaghan 2023 (apologies - cocked up the the title: 
[How the Reserve Bank Implements Monetary Policy]()) and the LSAP review 
Note that the review is just a crock of shit (as you’ll see) and that 
Karen Silk’s speech (Monetary Policy Implementation in New Zealand) is good too.
 
Frazer 2004 is the best you’ll find on ‘software implementation’ (i.e., 
mechanics of government finance) – although I think there is a slight mistake 
in the settlement cash box (box 2, p. 6). Primarily, the end of day balance of 
the Treasury’s ESAS account (equivalent to the daily sum of consolidated 
cash flows in accounts at Westpac Government Branch minus whatever else NZDM 
has in it for other cash management purposes --- ESAS accounts cannot be 
overdrawn) indicates whether there has been a net injection or withdrawal 
of settlement cash which represents the government cash influence. This 
triggers reflexive bond issuance (if the GCI is negative) to ‘fill the 
spending gap’ (in other words, replenish the CSA adherent to the cash 
management strategy in place --- amongst other things, the $15 billion 
NZD ‘liquidity buffer’). 
Department/Crown bank accounts cannot be overdrawn as is stipulated in 
Treasury instructions (although sub accounts may be overdrawn, but the net 
position must remain positive). Note here too that departmental and Crown 
bank accounts at the Westpac Government Branch are on the Treasury’s balance 
sheet --- not Westpac’s (I’ll come back to this soon). 

> The CSA are the Crown Cash Settlement Accounts.

Our left-brain-only friends have been duped by New Public Financial 
Management --- they’re ignoring the complicated institutional processes that 
underlie the numbers they read in those reports. Honestly unbelievable and 
frustrating how people can be ‘progressive’ and ‘critical’ but still adhere to 
the NPFM lunacy (or fail to recognise that there’s more to life than 
accountancy). Another thing to note here for our left brain only type friends 
is that the overdraft in respect of the CSA has probably been used far more 
than what has been let on. One person who works in the Financial Markets Team 
at the RBNZ (who operate the CSA at the RBNZ) said to me ‘yes it has been 
used before COVID and if you look at our annual reports you’ll see us 
reporting on it’ to which I replied ‘there was no mention of the use of the 
overdraft before 2020’. She looked pretty surprised! Now, we know that all 
spending starts from 0 (i.e., every dollar the government spends is a new 
dollar) and that the overdraft facility really indicates an inability of NZDM 
to do its job effectively (which is likely why cash management isn’t 
mentioned (barely at best) in any Treasury Annual Reports), but the use of 
the overdraft facility to meet bond maturities and other spending obligations 
proves – even in the left brain only logic --- that the government is always 
able to meet its payment obligations.  That’s worth keeping in mind and 
pointing out to people. 

I’m going to surprise you here and tell you that the RBNZ Building at 2 
The Terrace is probably not filled with monetarist soldiers. In fact, in 
my meetings with RBNZ types (managers etc), there is actually a lot of 
frustration with the status quo. Namely, people are frustrated with the 
perception that monetary policy is the only game in town and want fiscal 
policy to enjoy a more prominent role in economic management. Paul Conway 
has actually been quite open about this in webinars/MPC Decision pressers 
etc, but it does run deeper than that within the RBNZ. My suspiscion is that 
they are worried to rock the boat --- coming out and saying that monetary 
policy is ineffective would get them in trouble with their ideological 
stewards across the street at 1 The Terrace (although, the ineffectiveness 
of MP has been noted to me privately by RBNZ people in the past). It may be 
naïve, but I do think that the RBNZ could be allies in shifting the dial 
on economic management in New Zealand (i.e., from monetary dominance to 
fiscal policy supporting the economy --- which is exactly what me and my 
RBNZ manager contact were talking about). 

> I kept the name Paul Conway in here, since Morgan says Conway's views 
are a matter of public record. 

On your first question Bijou, it depends what you are looking at and how you 
view things. Do interest rates actually result in price stability in the 
first place? The MPIF (MP implementation framework) stuff is very mechanical 
and is consistent with how they currently implement their mandate --- and it’s 
the closest you get in the mainstream paradigm to understanding how government 
spending actually works. When it comes to stuff like the NAIRU however, we 
know that that has nothing to do with price stability and is only a reflection 
of the neoliberal dominance of capital over labour (and the full employability 
framework --- i.e., employees should be able to adapt to market conditions). 

On your second question, I don’t know anyone at IRD, but I can almost 
guarantee that none of them would know anything about mechanics of 
government finance/MMT (though they do have an OIA that refers to the fact 
that they don’t retain the tax they collect --- not much but it is a start, 
I guess). 

I’m going to come back to what I promised I would before. I have had a few 
chats with a guy who used to work at the front desk at NZDM (so, managing 
disbursements from the CSA) and he told me that any bank balances in 
Departmental and Crown bank accounts are swept to the CSA to avoid Westpac 
default risk. 

This isn’t the case at all. Departmental and Crown bank accounts are on 
The Treasury’s balance sheet --- not Westpac’s. There is no solvency risk for 
the government. So NZDM’s rationale for ‘sweeping’ departmental and Crown 
bank account balances to the CSA is completely false --- which bemused Westpac’s 
senior manager of Government banking operations (who I had a 2hr chat with 
last Friday). From that --- and this is the point of this particularly long 
and drawn out tirade --- we were talking about the general lack of understanding 
at how settlement cash (including the banking system and, of course, 
government spending) operates. 

You might be wondering --- what's the rationale then? Well, the RBNZ pay the 
OCR on overnight deposits in the CSA, so that’s it.

My point is that there’s no (broad) knowledge on how these processes work 
even (especially) at NZDM and RBNZ --- let alone IRD.

Hopefully this is useful.

Chat soon!

Cheers,
Morgan

*NB:** I had asked Morgan if it was worthwhile trying to speak to IRD 
(New Zealand's tax department) people to get them to change the mere wording 
on their website, which makes it out they are the Robin Hood heroes grabbing 
our Sheriff of Nottingham tax dollars in order to keep the starving 
government peasants going!

It's not that they are not civil services heores, they've just got it the 
wrong way around, they're the Sheriff of Wellington spending tax credits 
when they spend their salaries, which gives us peasants the scoreponts with 
which we can pay the tax.

That's all for today, just this note, but I hope it is useful to you, it 
was for me. Even if you lose in an ear drum bashing contest, called a 
"debate" with a hihgly left-brained economist nerd, you cna sleep ok at night 
knowing you were right, and just have no debating skills. It sucks to have 
no debating skills, but the upside of it could be that it means you are an 
empathetic person. That's not a bad consolation prize.
