A classic paper today. Mandatory MMT reading.

Warren Mosler's 1997 [](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4538575) is a little bit of MMT 
gold in a highly readable nugget of 17 pages. 
I recommend the journal article for the elegant typesetting, for educational fair
use contact me and I can send you an electronic copy. For the free public version 
you can go to the UMKC website 
[here: Full Employment and Price Stability](http://k.web.umkc.edu/keltons/ECON501/Mosler.htm).


## Take-aways from Fixed vs Floating Exchange Rates

Mosler analyses tow illustrative cases:

1. The Russian ruble under a fixed exchange rate policy.
2. The Hong Kong dollar under a currency board.

In both cases the artificial self-imposed constraints will tend to cause interest rate pressure from the money market, resulting in inflation risk if full employment is also 
adopted. In the two case studies full employment was not even achieved.

* A fixed exchange rate is a constraint on the government, an artificial constraint.
* This limits available policy space.
* Full employment could still be achieved, but at the risk of continual inflation, 
though not necessarily hyperinflation. Possibly not even increasing inflation, but 
obviously quite likely a high constant rate of inflation.
* For political (psychological and political constituency ``tolerance'') reasons it 
is better to keep inflation moderate to low.
* With this goals, a floating exchange rate would be preferred.

### You Get it all backwards

A floating exchange rate economy is so vastly different to an economy constrained by 
a fixed exchange rate or currency peg, that it flips conventional orthodox economic 
thinking. One can say if the policy mentality carried over form a fixed exchange 
rate period of governance gets moved unchanged into a flaoting exchange rate regimes, 
then this mainstream orthodox thinking will be in many senses completely backwards, 
and hence potentially very regressive.

**Think:** 
> The economy is an elite athlete and the economists want to put a plastic bag over 
her head and whip her to make her run faster.
