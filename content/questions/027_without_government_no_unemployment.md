There is this issue libertarian nut-cases and MMT'ers might agree upon in 
crudest form: *without government there is no unemployment*. But MMT has a 
very different perspective. We want a good government **_and_** we want full 
employment, and we can in fact have both. It is a political choice, not a 
whim of natural markets.

The (correct) MMT statement is,

> With government there is unemployment by design, from inception, but also 
*with government* all the unemployment generated should (morally and 
optimally) be immediately eliminated.


## Question: Without Government $\Rightarrow$ Full employment?

Yes. But it is a bit more nuanced.

I had a private conversation with Prof Steve Keen on this, and he was 
disagreeing with Mosler and Mitchell. For what it's worth I side with Mosler 
and Mitchell. But it comes down to definitions. I suspect Steve was thinking 
of "employment" as people working, which it is not.
 
People are working whether they are getting a pay check or not, typically. 
Maybe working hard watching YoutUbe and eating junk food, but if they are 
not actively seeking to exchange their labour for the currency then they are 
not unemployed. In Steve keen's definition they would be "unemployed" --- but 
what he means is idle.

In a monetary economy idleness does not equate to unemployment.

People often get this wrong about MMT. MMT uses a certain definition that 
others are perhaps not fully aware of:

> **Unemployment** or **_to be unemployed_** is defined by seeking to 
exchange one's labour time for the tax credit.

What makes this a truly important definition is that it is useful and has 
several concrete functional implications --- implications for how the monetary 
system is governed.... or negligently governed.

In the olden days you could substitute an analogous definition, such as 
seeking not to be beaten to death by a slave owner, or seeking to not have 
one's hut burned down by the colonists. I am pretty sure most people, even 
libertarians would see the MMT definition as the less evil. But that's no fault 
of MMT that *unemployment* sounds pretty nasty. It is a fault of the currency 
monopolist. They have no reason to keep people unemployed nor any reason to 
make the work people seek to earn tax credits onerous.

### How is the answer "yes"?

The answer is "yes" when you suitably generalize what the word "government" 
means. The MMT generalization is,

> **Government** is the, or one of several, monopoly powers that are using 
tax liabilities to drive an otherwise worthless currency.

Let's abstract and call this governing power simply $\mathfrak{G}$.

This applies even if the $\mathfrak{G}$ promises to redeem their scorepoints 
for gold or silver or pizza. This does not make the currency a real commodity, 
it is still nominal scorekeeping. Not just because $\mathfrak{G}$ could at any 
time (with monopoly power) decide to stop redeeming, but also because even 
when $\mathfrak{G}$ promises to redeem for a real commodity that is determined 
by their imposed rate of exchange. They tell you what their currency is worth. 
They set both the own price and the exchange price.

It is also true regardless of how weak the $\mathfrak{G}$ is, if they are 
puppets swayed by oligarchs, then all that really means is you've got a 
specific type of government, but still one of the generalized forms. In this 
case the form of government is a hybrid perhaps, but mostly an oligarchy. It 
is still a $\mathfrak{G}$.


### How is the answer "no"?

If you do not have a $\mathfrak{G}$ --- of some form, any form, --- then you 
have no currency. Maybe you have some weird hybrid currency system, but 
whoever controls the scoprepoints is your $\mathfrak{G}$, or one of many. If 
they are not using a tax system --- or something like it --- to drive demand 
for the otherwise worthless scorepoints, then you have no currency, as MMT 
defines the currency unit.

If you have no currency then no one is seeking to exchange their labour for 
getting those scorepoints. So there is no unemployment *in that currency* but 
there could be unemployment in some other currency (namely whoever is 
imposing the obligations to earn that currency) but then they are some sort 
of $\mathfrak{G}$.

You now see the mental problem with those who think "unemployment" is a 
natural phenomenon? 

Thus, no matter how you slice things, unemployment is created by 
$\mathfrak{G}$. Of one form or another. Steve Keen was wrong. 

But of course, to be generous, Keen is using his own *different* definition 
of unemployment, which presumably has the idle rich being "unemployed" (not 
wage earning). MMT sees things differently. The existence of those people is 
a loss of real output, and an effective rent on the labour of everyone else 
who is producing real goods for society. But still, those idle slackers are 
not unemployed. They are just *not working*.  If they are not *seeking* to 
exchange their labour time for the currency then they are fully employed.

Definitions matter for civilized discourse. But the point of this article 
goes beyond the word games and political linguistic gymnastics. The real 
point is to see how we can obtain a better society. It is clearly by producing 
real output everyone needs for a decent sort of life, not in excess, just 
decent. And by the Twentieth century we had the collective means to achieve 
this goal. It was political choice that prevented humanity from realizing 
this goal.  Neoliberalism (of both left-wing and right-wing varieties) 
succumbed to the neo-darwinist disease of thinking competition is good, and 
if the evil hand of government was just relaxed more we'd find a decent 
society.

I am afraid that is not how political economy based on a monetary system 
ever works. I mean literally *afraid* because this ideology is a cause of 
so much unnecessary suffering. Base case suffering is involuntary 
unemployment $\Rightarrow$ people seeking unsuccessfully to exchange their 
labour for the 
currency. There is little indication this baleful ideology will be dying off 
any time soon. We are infested with neoliberals, and we have friends and 
neighbours who are neoliberals without even knowing it, it is soaked and dyed 
into the popular culture.


## What Do We Really Want?

We want more than full employment. By MMT definitions full employment is 
desirable, but not necessarily optimal.

What is optimal is everyone contributing to real output according to their 
capacity, with mild tax obligation motives, but more importantly for the 
motive of desiring a healthier society.  That means all work being done needs 
to be useful work, in terms of some ill-defined but meaningful sense of 
increasing the prosperity of society at all levels, not just for those at the 
top of the heap.
