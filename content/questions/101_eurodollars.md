Much like Petrodollars, the Eurodollar system is widely misunderstood, and 
not just by people who are not using it!


## What Are Eurodollars?

This is from analysis Nick Gomez, and is better than the Wikipedia entry:

> _"The Eurodollars are simply ledgers recording loans (bank assets) denominated in the US dollar."_ 

I would put in in Dirtbag MMT terms:

> The eurodollar system is all just shifting scorepoints around among the 
rich. So is disconnected from working class concerns

Nick continues:

_"The system arose from trade settlements (oil, mostly) using the dollar.
It creates demand for the dollar. It is just ledger-keeping by foreign banks  for (mostly) oil-rich folk and corporations._

"_If they didn’t want to transact in US$, then nobody is stopping them from using a different currency. But that would make everything slower, more complicated, and costly._"


### Extra Liquidity?

No. The FED does foreign reverse repos to manage liquidity and demand. And 
all US$ transactions are recorded by the “mother” ledger at the NY FED. Same 
for any other central bank. No one needs the eurodollar system for 
macroeconomic liquidity management.


### Secured?

No.

Similar to a Euroyen or ""Europeso" (if there were such a thing), you would 
not have central bank or other government insured deposits, making these 
"euro-currencies" more risky to hold.

The social status of "eurodollar" is thus largely fictional, and is leaning 
on the "US dollar" for psychological support.

People still seem to believe these tokens have intrinsic value and are 
somehow metaphorically "dug up out of the ground."  But as they say, if a 
myth persists it can be materially effective.  e witness this in complete 
inverted terms with the Samuelson myth of the "need" to keep the public 
ignorant of MMT. You know, the whole: "If people understood the government 
creates currency by fiat then the government would start spending like a drunken sailor and we'd have hyperinflation!"

Well dear Sirs, if the government caused hyperinflation by spending on hiring 
people to do nice things, then that'd be a darned good thing. For starters, a billionaire's hoard of "$" from a decade ago would be reduced to pennies 
(in real terms).

There really is no real economic purpose for these euro-currencies. In many 
ways I view them as similar to cryptocurrencies, because there is no authority 
promising to redeem them, and so their intrinsic values is zero. Like baseball 
cards. Unlike postage stamps (you can redeem a postage stamp for postal 
delivery, if not for tax credits.)


### Is it like Fractional Reserve Banking?

No.

Traditional textbook description of "fractional reserve banking" does not 
accurately describe how _either_ US bank credit is created today, nor does 
it apply in the same way to the eurodollar system.

### US Bank Credit Creation is Not Reserve-Constrained

In the modern US banking system, banks do **not** lend out existing deposits 
nor are they constrained by the amount of reserves they hold. Instead, banks 
create deposits "ex nihilo" (from nothing) when they make loans. They only 
need to ensure they have enough reserves to meet settlement obligations and 
regulatory requirements, which, since March 2020, have been set to zero for 
transaction accounts by the Federal Reserve. If additional reserves 
are needed, banks can obtain them after the fact (ex post) from the interbank 
market or the central bank.

The key constraint for US banks is **creditworthiness of the borrower** and 
the bank’s own capital requirements, not the level of reserves on hand.

I think this covers the basics, for more depth it might be useful to write 
a little bit on the history and some operational details.


## Issuance, Origins, and Convertibility

**Who Issues Eurodollars?**

Eurodollars are US dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside the 
United States or in offshore branches of US banks. These deposits are not 
subject to US banking regulations and are created by foreign banks through 
the process of credit creation—essentially, they are "loaned into existence" 
via the same fractional reserve banking practices as domestic dollars
(my account here is an MMT analysis, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) or [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurodollar.asp) for other --- potentially slightly erroneous --- orthodox accounts). 

Thus, the only issuers of eurodollars are banks (and sometimes non-bank 
financial institutions) that are licensed to accept dollar deposits outside 
the US There is no central authority or state entity that issues eurodollars; 
they exist as promises by these banks to pay US dollars, not as liabilities 
of the US government or Federal Reserve.

**Origins of the Eurodollar System**

The eurodollar system originated in the aftermath of World War II, when 
large amounts of US dollars flowed into Europe through mechanisms like the 
Marshall Plan and international trade surpluses. European entities, 
including governments and corporations, preferred to keep their dollar 
holdings in European banks rather than repatriate them to the US. 
The first eurodollar accounts were often established to shield dollar assets 
from potential US government seizure, as in the case of the Soviet Union 
and Communist China during the early Cold War. Thus, the initial stock 
of eurodollars was indeed US dollars, physically or legally held offshore.

The 
[Wikipedia entry on the eurodollar]([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) is fairly reliable as a source of much of this history, and as 
far as I can tell not too controversial on the histroy.

**Are Eurodollars Now Decoupled from US Dollar Deposits?**

Over time, the eurodollar system evolved from merely holding surplus US 
dollars offshore to a system where offshore banks create new 
dollar-denominated deposits through lending, independent of any direct 
inflow of physical US dollars. Today, eurodollars are largely "decoupled" 
from the original stock of physical US dollars; they are created as book 
entries by offshore banks, just as domestic US banks create dollar deposits 
through lending. The eurodollar market is now a vast, 
self-sustaining network of dollar-denominated liabilities and assets, not 
simply a pool of redeposited US cash.

However, _more importantly_ as I remarked earlier, the eurodollar system is 
entirely a rich guys game, and decoupled from all working class interests. 
The government does not need eurodollar systems in order to drive full 
employment.  The sole driver of full employment in non-ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs is 
government policy decision making, not "finding the money".

Having eurodollars floating around the ledgers does absolutely nothing to 
diminish the government capacity to run full employment policy, and if 
expanded eurodollar credit was actually causing some inflation it would 
still not diminish the government capacity.  Inflation is not a 
real constraint for the government, it is a psychological constraint, and 
so can be removed by a mysterious process called _thinking_.

**Are Eurodollars "Backed" by Anything?**

From an MMT perspective, the key distinction is that only the US government 
(via the Federal Reserve) can issue the dollars necessary to pay taxes or settle payments to the US state. Eurodollars are promises by foreign banks to pay US dollars, but these banks are not part of the Federal Reserve System and cannot directly access US central bank reserves. These banks may also run out of USD 
reserves, and so can be at risk of needing to acquire USD through their own borrowings.  Which begs the question why any one bothers?

As the history seems to record, the Europenas simply perhaps do not trust 
US banks to keep the deposits secure. This is slightly mad, since no one of 
decent repute has ever had a US bank default on a deposit guarantee. But 
there is sometimes little rational sense in accounting for the psychology 
of the ultra-rich. You can tell them there is no risk in holding accounts 
in US banks, but they have toe power to act as if things are otherwise.
(Though as do we all! I can swap my US dollars for NZD, if I am prepared 
to suffer the transaction fee.)


Therefore, eurodollars are not really "backed" by a promise of redemption by 
the US state. Their value rests on the ability and willingness of the issuing 
bank to convert them into actual US dollars if demanded, typically by settling 
through correspondent accounts with US banks. In times of stress, the risk 
is that eurodollar holders may not be able to redeem at par, introducing 
credit and liquidity risk absent from domestic US dollar deposits.

**Are Eurodollars Directly Convertible to USD for Payments to the US Government?**

No.

Eurodollars are not directly convertible to US dollars for settling payments 
to the US government. To do so, a eurodollar deposit must be converted into 
a US bank deposit—typically via a correspondent banking relationship --- before 
it can be used to pay taxes or settle with the US Treasury. Only deposits 
within the US banking system, backed by Federal Reserve reserves, can be 
used for such payments. There is no legal or institutional guarantee that 
a eurodollar can always be converted to a US dollar at par, especially in 
periods of financial stress.

## Table: Eurodollars vs. US Bank Dollars

| Feature                  | Eurodollars (Offshore USD)         | US Bank Dollars (Onshore USD)    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Issuer                   | Foreign banks/offshore US banks    | US banks (regulated by Fed)      |
| Regulatory regime        | Not subject to US Fed regulations  | Subject to US Fed regulations    |
| Backed by State?         | No (not redeemable by US state)    | Yes (Fed liabilities, insured)   |
| Use for US tax payments  | No (must convert to US deposit)    | Yes                              |
| Redemption guarantee     | By issuing bank only               | By US state (FDIC, Fed)          |
| Creation mechanism       | Credit creation (loans)            | Credit creation (loans)          |

## Summary

- Only banks (and some non-banks) outside the US banking system issue 
eurodollars, via credit creation.
- The eurodollar system began with surplus US dollars held offshore but 
now operates as a largely independent credit system, with new eurodollars 
created by offshore lending.
- Eurodollars are not directly redeemable for US dollars by the US government; 
they must be converted through correspondent banking relationships.
- There is no state guarantee backing eurodollars; their value relies on 
market confidence and the creditworthiness of the issuing bank.
- From an MMT perspective, eurodollars are not "money" in the sense of being 
state liabilities usable for settling obligations to the US government—they 
are private promises to pay US dollars, with associated credit and 
liquidity risks.

In essence, eurodollars are a market-driven, offshore system of 
dollar-denominated account entries, with value determined by confidence 
and convertibility rather than any intrinsic or state-backed guarantee.
