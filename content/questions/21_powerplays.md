## The Hard Problem of MMT

It's about time I start writing more about the <font style="color:#cc66ff">*Hard Problem of MMT*</font>. This is the problem of getting nations that have MMT currency systems to 
actually **(a)** acknowledge this, and **(b)** use this knowledge to implement the MMT 
Base Case, meaning,

* **Permanent Zero Interest Rate Policy**
* **National Job Guarantee**
* **Pension Payments Made When Due** (scrap the phony Trust Funds)
* **Narrow Banking proposals**

It goes without saying that anyone dimly aware of MMT will run this base case, if 
in power. 
They might even run a periodic Debt Jubilee, or equivalently relax some punitive 
aspects of bankruptcy law. Whether they be capitalist, socialist, autocracy, 
communist or anarchist societies (and most are mixed --- let's be honest *all* are 
mixed societies) they *will* run these three policies, all they need is a smidgeon of 
populism (meaning a bit of vainglory desire to be wildly popular without lies and 
deception, by being a genuine character). And let's face it, pretty much every 
politician has such vainglory. There is no other option absent stupidity.

As I often say, only half-joking, the only political ideology incompatible with MMT is 
neoliberalism. If we fudge a bit I can make the case this is no joke.

It's a huge f-ing problem because while knowing almost all nations (even the EU in a way) 
run an MMT system (non-convertible fiat currencies driven by taxation) the 
influential academics, the prominent industrialists, the more dangerous lobbyists, 
the dumb-dumb lefties, the right-wingnuts, almost all the politicians, the permanent 
civil service, almost to a person, do not understand this. Even if they understand 
the system they seem to in their actions and speech not understand the implications.

Thus education is the first element of the 
<font style="color:#cc66ff">Hard MMT Problem</font>. Without knowledge, there is no power leveraging that knowledge.
So this is one theme I will write about. It seems a simple problem to solve, but once 
you understand academic paradigms in a largely non-scientific profession like 
economics (dearth of good data for testing rival theories) you'll see education is 
indeed a hard component of the The Hard MMT Problem. I will try not to belabour this 
point, but once you get the gist of it I encourage you to go out into the world and 
try teaching people MMT. That'll be sufficient empirical proof it falls under the 
Hard Problem.

### Rough notes

* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Educational Hard Problem</font> is greatly aided and mitigated by the fact once you grok MMT there is no going back to false knowledge. So there is a ratchet effect. This is always powerful in slowly driving a paradigm change.
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The language framing HP</font> --- a tough one. Even good MMT'ers capitulate to standard language framing, unconsciously perhaps. It takes a fair bit of will power and tolerance of people staring weirdly at you to overcome.
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Inertia HP</font> --- pretty darn tough. "I'm doing good, leave things alone."
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Seizing Government Seats HP</font> --- this may come last, but I suspect I might end up concluding this is an easy problem, or only moderately hard. The principle behind this being politicians are sheep, they are followers not leaders. So putting MMT aware politicians into government depends on the educational HP. 
Once the Education HP is solved, it should be (this is the question) easy to first locally nominate good people, then get them elected. What workers anywhere is not perpetually freaked out by the threat of being unemployed?

#### Supplemental Notes

These scrap notes are important, but I'll give away the sneak peek.

* The <font style="color:#cc66ff">Seizing Government HP</font> has a very interesting 
Lemma, which is that you really must (I say "must" but I'd be ok with "should") adopt 
a non-partisan local political nomination strategy. If your country has a partisan 
party system this is tough, but you can always try getting an MMT candidate on all 
the party ballots. The beauty of MMT is that this should be relatively easy, 
conditional upon the Educational HP being largely solved.

Let the political parties battle out the culture wars. As long as they all acknowledge 
MMT were going to all be better off regardless. I mean, for heavens sake, give the fascism 
a rest will you right-wingers! Give the violent militancy pretensions a rest tankies! 
Some culture war issues are just fake issues, pretensions of knaves and fools.


## Punking the Plutocrats

There is a common thread to all the above Hard Problems, which is overcoming the power of 
the present day powers. The oligarchs and plutocrats. 

General popular public opinion is in our favour here, and that's the leverage, this 
and of course the knowledge of MMT. But there is a third more invisible lever we 
probably have to pull, which is spirituality, or in the common parlance: morality and 
ethics, or in even less pretentious parlance --- basic human dignity and decency. But 
all these are the same in my eyes. (There is a time and a place for being pedantic, 
but this ain't it.)

When I say "we probably have to pull" I mean I know I have to pull on that lever, it's the most powerful lever, and I hope others recognize this too. 

### Levers of Power

Plutocrats and oligarchs certainly exercise temporal institutional power, and 
financial power. But this is not the most powerful force in society, not even in 
a monetary production system.

Money can't do squat without labour and machines to produce the output, wherever they 
happen to reside, domestic or on foreign shores. 
This means labour really has the upper hand. the problem is in generating the 
consciousness of this power. there almost is none!
This power is all nascent and latent, it used to exist to some degree during the 
golden age of the labour movement, but neoliberal psychology has deeply suppressed 
worker cooperatives and unions.

Unions of course, after initial fantastic gains, proved eventually to have 
diminishing returns on activism and so became largely ineffective because they were 
eventually dominated by class traitors and corruption at the top level. So if we are 
going to go back to a union movement to spur MMT and spiritual economics we'd better 
be careful.

To my mind a few basic principles should be adopted:

1. Unions cannot be plural. It works better f there is only one union, fighting for all workers, not just sector-by-sector (which often pts worker against worker). 
2. The wage demand has to be a demand for freedom form wage slavery too! This implies a job gaurantee has to be the principle demand: make the bosses fight for workers.
3. Workplace democracy: this means the demadn has to also be for collective worker ownership in the private sector. There's no need to have state ownership (centrally planend socialism) but there is a need for more worker autonomy, hence workplace democracy. People need a say in their workplace, we know this form basic psychology, Maslow's heirarchy and all that, "the happy worker is the more productive one" is the (exagerated but spiritually correct) meme.
4. Lower the work week. Removing bullsh*t jobs can be done by heating up the monetary economy simultaneous with cooling down the real energy use economy. "Cool otput, hot wages."

On the first principle, a very recent class case of dysfunction is in the airline 
industry, where one airline offers their workers sweet deals which undermine unions 
efforts for wage bargaining at a competition airline. The COVID lockdown effects on 
travel and hospitality brought such dysfunction and schisms to light, but it's always 
been present in unions that are not truly unions. A union has to be a worker's union, 
not a trade union, so has to be *all workers everywhere*.

The old model of unions bought too heavily into neoclassical economics myths. it was 
all about competition for wages from "loanable funds" which automatically pits worker 
against worker, a great win for the capitalist class. Damaging for output for all in 
society. Even the upper class Tories lose when worker competition for wages drives up 
prices if blue-blood government is not supporting the rentiers through Treasury bond 
issue!

On the 4th point: over-heating the real economy would not necessarily be a problem, 
except that today it is!  We're exceeding planetary boundaries in some sectors, while 
under-utilizing others. Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics framework is the 
appropriate lens for dealing with the real resource economics. The monetary economy 
side however has infinite room for inflation --- on floating exchange rates of 
course. Boosting inflation at full employment is healthy: the bosses will have to compete 
for workers. This is the proper way to turn the labour market into a fairer game.

Beyond this of course, there is a human rights case for de-commodifying labour 
completely. I'm not sure yet how to get there politically, but I suspect civil 
societies will get there, I just cannot see when. It's a spiritual problem, not 
material. People need to be able to stop succumbing to fake moral panic when they see 
workers become stronger.
Every worker earning income is sales for the other firm. You're only going to honestly 
see this is a panic if you're a rentier or a viscous employer, in which case good 
riddance to you!

While political time horizon is hard to see, the spiritual dynamic is pretty clear. 
Useful work is a service to humanity. Most people appreciate this is not slavery, but 
cooperation and altruism. Most people also recognize if given the chance people will 
work hard to help each other. We can continue for now with monetized labour, but in a 
spiritual civilization you can clearly see the wage form could become simply 
unnecessary. (By "spiritual civilization" I do **_not** mean disembodied beings, I mean 
honest, kind, just, wise and trustworthy people in your societies.)
We are a terribly long way away from such mass spiritual social conscience. So I am 
not sure if this s worth writing too much about for now, but maybe another day.

The great thing about spiritual society is that these attributes work in aid of each 
other, not in competition. A wise person, for instance, will always be inclined to be 
more honest and trustworthy, and same in the other direction --- when you are honest 
you also become wiser (e.g., although you might start as a collaborative learner you 
will eventually learn things fully internalized for yourself, not from received blind 
ideology). When you are trustworthy you might also be trusting yourself more, which 
redounds to confidence and humility, you also know better what you do not know, and so 
are always prepared to learn more.


### MMT and the Spiritual

Let me re-emphasise that I always use a populist conception of *spiritual* --- 
kindness, compassion, honesty, trustworthiness. Abstract virtues in other words, not 
metaphysical states of being. (The abstract virtues *are* metaphysical, but we're 
seeing them manifested in physical creatures).

I've always seen MMT as a critical inseparable component of Spiritual Economics. Why?

It is because MMT is the only truly <font style="color:#cc66ff">*honest*</span> 
framework for macroeconomics. 
If you disagree than by all means let me know 
(please [donate](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/) so I can justify listening to 
your arguments.)

Honesty is the key spiritual virtue here. It's another question whether you can trust 
or find kindness and compassion in MMT, since MMT is a framework for analysis I argue 
you cannot find these spiritual qualities, however, they are latent because when 
real people implement just policies by employing their knowledge of MMT then you get the 
greater gamut of spiritual qualities manifested in material relations.

((Even a dumb Marxist can understand this in terms pf their jargon of base structure 
and superstructure. Superstructure is mostly abstract. Hence in the superstructure 
you can recognize spiritual virtues or the lack of them.))
