It's about time I start writing more about the *Hard Problem of MMT*. This is the 
problem of getting nations that have MMT currency systems to actually 
**(a)** acknowledge this, and **(b)** use this knowledge to implement the MMT Base Case, meaning,

* **Permanent Zero Interest Rate Policy**
* **National Job Guarantee**
* **Narrow Banking proposals**

It goes without saying that anyone dimly aware of MMT will run this base case. Whether 
they be capitalist, socialist, autocracy, communist or anarchist societies (and most are 
mixed --- let's be honest *all* are mixed societies). They *will* run these three 
policies. There is no other option absent stupidity.

As I often say, only half-joking, the only political ideology incompatible with MMT is 
neoliberalism. If we fudge a bit I can make the case this is no joke.

It's a huge f-ing problem because while knowing almost all nations (even the EU in a way) run an MMT system (non-convertible fiat currencies driven by taxation)
