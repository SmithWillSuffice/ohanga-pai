## The Hard Problem of MMT

It's about time I start writing more about the <font style="color:#cc66ff">*Hard Problem of MMT*</font>. This is the problem of getting nations that have MMT currency systems to 
actually **(a)** acknowledge this, and **(b)** use this knowledge to implement the MMT 
Base Case, meaning,

* **Permanent Zero Interest Rate Policy**
* **National Job Guarantee**
* **Pension Payments Made When Due** (scrap the phony Trust Funds)
* **Narrow Banking proposals**

It goes without saying that anyone dimly aware of MMT will run this base case, if 
in power. 
They might even run a periodic Debt Jubilee, or equivalently relax some punitive 
aspects of bankruptcy law. Whether they be capitalist, socialist, autocracy, 
communist or anarchist societies (and most are mixed --- let's be honest *all* are 
mixed societies) they *will* run these three policies. There is no other option 
absent stupidity.

As I often say, only half-joking, the only political ideology incompatible with MMT is 
neoliberalism. If we fudge a bit I can make the case this is no joke.

It's a huge f-ing problem because while knowing almost all nations (even the EU in a way) 
run an MMT system (non-convertible fiat currencies driven by taxation) the influential academics, the prominent industrialists, the more dangerous lobbyists, the dumb-dumb lefties, the right-wingnuts, almost all the politicians, the permanent civil service, almost to a person, do not understand this.

Thus education is the first element of the <font style="color:#cc66ff">Hard MMT Problem</font>. Without knowledge, there is no power leveraging that knowledge.
So this is one theme I will write about. It seems a simple problem to solve, but once you understand academic paradigms in a largely non-scientific profession like economics (dearth of good data for testing rival theories) you'll see education is indeed a hard component of the <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Hard MMT Problem</font>. I will try not to belabour this point, but once you get the gist of it I encourage you to go out into the world and try teaching people MMT. That'll be sufficient empirical proof it falls under the <font style="color:#cc66ff">Hard Problem</font>.

### Rough notes

* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Educational Hard Problem</font> is greatly aided and mitigated by the fact once you grok MMT there is no going back to false knowledge. So there is a ratchet effect. This is always powerful in slowly driving a paradigm change.
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The language framing HP</font> --- a tough one. Even good MMT'ers capitulate to standard language framing, unconsciously perhaps. It takes a fair bit of will power and tolerance of people staring weirdly at you to overcome.
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Inertia HP</font> --- pretty darn tough. "I'm doing good, leave things alone."
* <font style="color:#cc66ff">The Seizing Government Seats HP</font> --- this may come last, but I suspect I might end up concluding this is an easy problem, or only moderately hard. The principle behind this being politicians are sheep, they are followers not leaders. So putting MMT aware politicians into government depends on the educational HP. 
Once the Education HP is solved, it should be (this is the question) easy to first locally nominate good people, then get them elected. What workers anywhere is not perpetually freaked out by the threat of being unemployed?

#### Supplemental Notes

These scrap notes are important, but I'll give away the sneak peek.

* The <font style="color:#cc66ff">Seizing Government HP</font> has a very interesting 
Lemma, which is that you really must (I say "must" but I'd be ok with "should") adopt 
a non-partisan local political nomination strategy. If your country has a partisan 
party system this is tough, but you can always try getting an MMT candidate on all 
the party ballots. The beauty of MMT is that this should be relatively easy, 
conditional upon the Educational HP being largely solved.

Let the political parties battle out the culture wars. As long as they all acknowledge 
MMT were going to all be better off regardless. I mean, for heavens sake, give the fascism 
a rest will you right-wingers! Give the violent militancy pretensions a rest tankies! 
Some culture war issues are just fake issues, pretensions of knaves and fools.


## Punking the Plutocrats

There is a common thread to all the above Hard Problems, which is overcoming the power of 
the present day powers. The oligarchs and plutocrats. 

General popular public opinion is in our favour here, and that's the leverage, this 
and of course the knowledge of MMT. But there is a third more invisible lever we 
probably have to pull, which is spirituality, or in the common parlance: morality and 
ethics, or in even less pretentious parlance --- basic human dignity and decency. But 
all these are the same in my eyes. (There is a time and a place for being pedantic, 
but this ain't it.)
