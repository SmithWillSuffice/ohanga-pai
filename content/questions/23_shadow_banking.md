Short article for this chapter, and mainly some links. Shadow banking arises when 
people find a need for credit and cannot get it form a licenced bank. At least that's 
the basic story. 

## Overview

Synopsis:
: **(a)** There is no essential need for shadow  banks.
: **(b)** Shadow banks nevertheless pop up because government licencers fail to adequately provision the private banks.
: **(c)** The basic provision needed is not cash, but full 100% deposit insurance. 
The proper place for discipline on private banks is on their asset side, not their 
liabilities.

The last policy is critical. On a floating exchange rate the monopoly currency issuer 
(aka. government) is not financially constrained, so **(i)** can always provide full 
deposit insurance, and **(ii)** does not risk a currency depreciation nor 
hyperinflation when doing so. On a fixed exchange rate there would be such risk, but 
thy are entirely inapplicable to the USA economy today, and to most nations operating 
a fiat currency monopoly.

### Excess Credit Risk

The argument from free market and neoclassical ideologues is that if the government 
insures deposits the "tax payer" is stiffed with holding the bill. 

**MMT lens correction:** This is completely inapplicable for a government running a 
floating exchange rate policy for a non-convertible currency (aka. the tax credits).

The other argument is that private banks that are not heavily regulated need market 
discipline. 

**MMT lens correction:** The market cannot adequately discipline bank credit, no one, 
not even the new AI systems, knows what the true risk of depositing at any particular 
bank might be. The government should just remove all such risk. The discipline on 
banks should then be strict credit assessment and prudential requirements, these can 
be made very simple: tell bankers only what they *can* do. They are not allowed to 
do anything else. If banking is *narrow* in this sense, with the list of activities 
banks "can do" made very narrow (basically clear payments and assess credit 
worthiness) then the regulatory bureaucratic burden is minimised, and fits with the 
public purpose.

The last point answers critics of MMT who claim MMT is a sort of hyper-government 
approach. It is not. MMT allows us to have as small a government as we desire. The 
point of regulation should be as simple as needed, but no simpler. Banks can be 
easily well-regulated with simple regulations telling banks the "can" and forget 
about listing the "cannots". Needless to say, all such regulations should be 
enforceable, and can be drafted to require minimal bureaucracy.

If you are a critic of private commercial banking and have not yet read 
Warren Mosler, this is all you need to know for starters. This goes the same if 
you are a critic of public banking too, or a critic of *any* banking system.

There is little point to going through parliamentary motions to pass regulatory 
legislation that cannot be enforced. It is a waste of time of policy makers. Only 
in some rare exceptions are regulations useful in serving a symbolic purpose.

For example, a nation might wish to retain a "death penalty" for certain heinous 
crimes, but choose to never enforce it, as a symbolic gesture. Such symbolic policy 
might be practical if, for instance, such crime rates were non-existent.

A lot of banking regulations could be automatically enforced by licenced 
open source software.

### "As small or as big a government as we desire""

My colleague [Douglas the MMT Macro Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader) gave us a (I think original) metaphor.

We can have super big government that is also non-invasive in the private market, 
and as liberal as the culture desires. He proposed the wide and flat versus tall 
and skinny axis concept.

You can incorporate this into the old 2D political landscape map, where,

* Forward = total anarchist
* Backwards = totalitarian government
* Left = so liberal you can walk around naked
* Right = so conservative you cannot bare your knuckles.

Douglas adds a third dimension, which is the policy space of government is completely 
recognized, and government is always "big" enough to issue enough currency for full 
employment, but the space is:

* Down = (government is short and very wide) big as in spending on fully public 
programs, as few as possible private markets. So private markets only for leisure 
goods and services, non-essentials.
* Middle = (robust government physique, neither tall and skinny, nor short and fat) 
big as in fully spending on all desired public services that hire all the unemployed 
the tax liability plus savings desires create, but no more. So this could be a system 
where the public sector might provide some public arts programs and the like, in 
addition to the social essentials.
* Up = (tall and skinny) big as in minimal tax liabilities only sufficient to drive 
the currency, no more. The culture desires otherwise no government services except 
tax system and legal system. The tall size of government here is in the tight 
regulatory control over taxation and legal contracts. It is akin to a form of 
totalitarianism, but highly *non-invasive* in peoples lives otherwise. Tall and 
narrow fits the picture I think. 

Notice this Up--Down axis has nothing to do with cultural morés. It is purely about how big we desire our government to be to fit the democratic consensus on "what is the public purpose." Which is mostly a currency monopoly set of operating parameters. 
The MMT axis, you might day.


### VCP for Bank Capital Requirements

One of the issues for small banks is the regulatory need to have capital, to 
satisfy capital adequacy requirements, which do tend to be well enforced. 
(See the list of Mosler proposals below.)

Mosler suggests a work-around for banks which find themselves capital constrained 
and yet also have trustworthy credit-worthy customers they should be lending to --- 
emphasis on *should*, since public purpose is not well served by artificially 
constraining credit. Non-fraudulent credit is Its own regulator through the need to 
repay the loan.

((Constraining fiat currency issue and bank credit issue artificially is like putting 
a plastic bag over the head of an elite athlete, the athlete is our real productive 
economy, not the predatory financial sector.))

The method Mosler recommends is the bank can issue VCP = variable convertible 
preferred stock.

**What is VCP?** Convertible preferred stock is a type of preferred share that pays 
a dividend and can be converted into common stock at a fixed conversion ratio after 
a specified time. The initial stock can be stocks in the bank. The customer then has 
an option to later sell this bank stock for common stock.

The method is that the bank should be permitted to offer their customer say 10% of 
the amount they desire to borrow as VCP. The customer can buy this stock. This adds 
to the bank balance sheet, and thus will automatically make the bank capitalised 
sufficient to make the loan, and then some, since most banks have about an 8% target 
capital ratio. Everyone is happy, the customer, the bank, the regulators.

Only the *mainstream economists* are unhappy, since their hair catches on fire with 
hyperinflation fear and panic, "Oh me oh my! Whatever can we do to impose austerity in 
bank credit now?" But they are not people. 

Mosler elaborates:
> The VCP functions as a ‘first loss piece’ for the bank as well. Terms of the VCP might include an interest rate equal to the loan rate, and a variable conversion ratio designed to give the borrower all her funds back if she doesn't default.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VCP is non-dilutive to the holders of common shares. This VCP proposal can free up and create new balance sheet and raise capital as it services borrowing desires.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to forward this to everyone you know in banking.

## Caveats

I am still learning banking system nuances. So do not quote any of my writing on 
these issues. I write most of my Ōhanga Pai articles for general public education, 
but with no veridical guarantee, just honesty that I write what I know. It is up to 
readers to fact check matters for themselves, which I regard as a good thing. I am 
really just a scribe, not an expert, at least not yet. There are probably hundreds 
of MMT economists superior to myself in their expertise. I would consider myself an expert if I were in the top dozen, which I am nowhere near.

If you trust me too much you might fail to follow-through with your own research, 
which would be bad, or potentially bad for your quality of learning let's say.
