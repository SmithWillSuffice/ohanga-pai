In recent Twitter discourse (or should that be childish spats?) a few MMT'ers are 
sniping at other MMT'ers on how to best conduct socail discoourse. To be clear, I 
don't think there are major disagreements in MMT analysis, but the emphais on the 
politics varies form person to person.

Thus, we get wbmosler who emphasises how the US economy is on a mild boom or bull run, 
thanks to interest rate hikes. Others prefer to emphasise the crippling effects of the 
interest rate hike son the poorest, who are forced to use credit just to eat and stay 
warm. 

I also sometimes get criticized for "defending Mosler." but this is balderdash. 
I try to defend what I think is correct, and ridicule what I think is stupid. I get it 
wrong sometimes, which is called being human, but I don't try deliberately to be wrong.

That said, some nuance is called for if you support Warren's discourse. That's what 
this post addresses. It is "dated" because this is 2023 immediately post-COVID supply 
shock era, so all the inflation is coming from supply constraint, not wage demands. 
That's a very important qualifier on everything in this post.

Generally I think moderate to high inflation is a *good thing* but only if it is 
being driven by the lowest wages rising.  This of course hardly ever occurs in the 
real world today, so we hardly ever see good quality inflation.  This matter a lot 
because inflation a continual rise in the price level) has many causes, it is not 
just a money supply dynamic. (Inflation never really is helicopter money, because 
government deficits inject currency for public purpose, even if it is terrible 
purpose --- like funding wars; and bank credit injects currency for private 
investment, again not always good purpose, but it serves someone's interest.)

We do see helicopter money effects though. A right-wingnut might say, "Yeah, those 
welfare moochers and Queens!" But that'd be completely wrong. A huge amount, in the 
trillions, of helicopter money is dropped into the economy (in the USA, NZ, Canada, 
UK,... plenty of nations) through Treasury bond issuance. Most of the welfare goes 
to people who already have money in direct proportion to how much money they already 
have.

Gotta keep those poor billionaires happy, right? 
Bloody "job creators" they are, right? LOL.

TODO:
I got side-tracked by more pressing concerns.
Will come back to this article later, or if 
a donor helps fund the write-up. $100 for a 
day or so of groceries and rent and electric ought 
to do it.
