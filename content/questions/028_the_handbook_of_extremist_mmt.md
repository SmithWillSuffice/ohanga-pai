This is a comedic chapter title! None of the aphorisms in this chapter 
are "from MMT". They are all my own opinion. However, it is not satirical 
or parody in any _other_respect but the chapter title and heading. 
Or is it? ðŸ¤£

If in doubt: a good aphorism is often a humorous half-truth, the funny bit 
about it is because the bit that is a lie is completely beside the point 
but will nevertheless be misconstrued by all and sundry potatoheads. In this 
case, the latter are all professional economists. 


## Extremist MMT Aphorisms

MMT'ers are _not_ economists, they are legal realists and anthropologists, 
despite whatever else they tell you.

Gold has never been money, but the money has sometimes been made of gold.ðŸ¤¯

Nominal inflation is never a financial nor economic problem, the policy response 
is the problem.

Inflation is an _effect_ not a cause.

Real inflation is a big frickin' problem, but has little to do with 
nominal inflation. The two need not even be well correlated, and can easily 
be anti-correlated over some time periods. That was not an aphorism, but 
the note had to be made. The aphorism is that you comment your code, but 
not so liberally that no one ever reads your code.

"Ballooning government deficits and debt" enable the non-government 
sector to fly.

"Living beyond our means and borrowing from China!" is what reactionary 
conservatives feverishly type into social media streams all night to train 
the LLM's. But it is also what well-educated progressives have no retort 
or counter-response towards, which means we are all screwed and ruled over 
by idiots.

There are only about 1% of humans alive who are living beyond our means. 
Unfortunately, when _they_ say, "We need to cut government spending because 
we are living beyond out means!" the last clause is true.

There will never be an AI Singularity with such LLM training texts.

Left-wing politics is pro-worker, period. But so should be right-wing 
politics: that the latter is not is a total moral disgrace.

The real costs of unemployment in one decade exceed the real costs and 
social fabric destruction of all wars in all human history, so inflation 
fear mongering is a mental illness. 

The government deficit is the non-government sector surplus, but only if 
you are not an economist.

The government debt is "paid off" (retired) every single accounts settlement 
day, so every month... without a single tax-payer in sight. But tell that 
to the economists and they will not believe you. 

If a government body says or tries to borrow their own currency off the 
banks they created by state licence, the appropriate remedy is to vote them 
out of office on mental illness grounds alone.

When the government is "spending like a drunken sailor", the appropriate 
response is to shut-up and take their money.

Inflation is a _de facto_ tax on hoarded wealth. Wait... where was the 
aphorism?  The aphorism is that Austrian School lunatics are not 
always wrong about everything, just about most things.

Yes, oligarchs and their price mark-ups cause an undesirable form of 
inflation through relative price adjustments, the harm is caused by 
hysteresis in wage adjustments not by the inflation _per se_, but it 
would not occur with a wise government.

Never worry about inflation. Fully employ anyone willing to work for tax 
credits, and give them the freedom to decide how to contribute to their 
community if they do not despite public sector jobs.

Never worry about private sector causes of inflation. Just don't allow 
them.
(This aphorism can only be aimed at a currency monopolist, not you or me, 
if aimed at you or me it is a poisonous snake, in the sense of blame on 
the victim for their inaction.)

Political inaction from the demos is not the fault of the workers, they 
are slaving to eat to survive. Any workers making just demands on their 
government are heroes, superior to Captain American and Superman (but _only_ 
because the latter two people are fictionalðŸ¤£).

One must sometimes give comic book geeks a comic... to learn MMT from. 

Knowledge of MMT is not wisdom. MMT wisdom is knowing the fair and just 
policy response available.

A wise government is by definition a strong government.

A strong government does not need a large army to a first approximation, 
because strength is in the love of the people. They will then rise to their 
own defence, and their government's, and in defence of other people of other 
nations, in un-numbered guerrilla ways if attacked.

You people cannot rise to their own defence is you immiserate them through 
an unemployed labour buffer scheme, or other fiscal austerity (and the rest).

Cryptocurrency is a plan cooked up by compsci nerds to (sort of legally) 
take money off silly people with their full consent. It is pretty ingenious. 
But morally and ecologically repugnant, which means not all genius is good 
to have.

Full employment is not a conspiracy theory policy and CIA Op. 
It is justice. The idea of a "job" however needs to be updated, to mean 
any spiritual endeavour in a trade, craft, art or profession that serves 
one's community.

One (of sound mind and moral clarity) never compensates spiritual endeavour 
with a pittance of a UBI.

One should always _fully_  compensate spiritual endeavours if One is the 
currency monopoly. There is no reason not to.

If I knew know what the human soul is, I'd be essentially like a god, and 
would not be stuck here writing these extremist MMT aphorisms.

If you say there is no soul, then you are _not even dumb_, though could 
likely beat me at chess. Which tells you something about chess.

(How did these aphorisms get onto this page dognabit!)
