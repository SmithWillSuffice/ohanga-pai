This is a comedic chapter title! None of the aphorisms in this chapter 
are "from MMT". They are all my own opinion. However, it is not satirical 
or parody in any _other_respect but the chapter title and heading. 
Or is it? ðŸ¤£

If in doubt: a good aphorism is often a humorous half-truth, the funny bit 
about it is because the bit that is a lie is completely beside the point 
but will nevertheless be misconstrued by all and sundry potatoheads. In this 
case, the latter are all professional economists. 

## Extremist MMT Aphorisms

MMT'ers are _not_ economists, they are legal realists and anthropologists, 
despite whatever else they tell you.

Gold has never been money, but the money has sometimes been made of gold.

Inflation is never a financial nor economic problem, the policy response 
is the problem.

Inflation is an _effect_ not a cause.

"Ballooning government deficits and debt" enable the non-government 
sector to fly.

Left-wing politics is pro-worker, period. But so should be right-wing 
politics: that the latter is not is a total moral disgrace.

The real costs of unemployment in one decade exceed the real costs and 
social fabric destruction of all wars in all human history, so inflation 
fear mongering is a mental illness. 

The government deficit is the non-government sector surplus, but only if 
you are not an economist.

The government debt is "paid off" (retired) every single accounts settlement 
day, so every month... without a single tax-payer in sight. But tell that 
to the economists and they will not believe you. 

If a government body says or tries to borrow their own currency off the 
banks they created by state licence, the appropriate remedy is to vote them 
out of office on mental illness grounds alone.

When the government is "spending like a drunken sailor", the appropriate 
response is to shut-up and take their money.

Inflation is a _de facto_ tax on hoarded wealth. Wait... where was the 
aphorisms?  The aphorism is that Austrian School lunatics are not 
always wrong about everything, just about most things.

Yes, oligarchs and their price mark-ups cause inflation, but it would not 
occur with a wise government.

Knowledge of MMT is not wisdom. MMT wisdom is knowing the fair and just 
policy response available.

A wise government is by definition a strong government.

A strong government does not need a large army to a first approximation, 
because strength is in the love of the people. They will then rise to their 
own defence, and their government's and in defence of other people of other 
nations, in un-numbered guerrilla ways if attacked.

You people cannot rise to their own defence is you immiserate them through 
an unemployed labour buffer scheme, or other fiscal austerity (and the rest).
