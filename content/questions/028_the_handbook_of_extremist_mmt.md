This is a comedic chapter title! None of the aphorisms in this chapter 
are "from MMT". They are all my own opinion. However, it is not satirical 
or parody in any _other_respect but the chapter title and heading.

If in doubt: a good aphorism is often a humorous half-truth, the funny bit 
about it is because the bit that is a lie is completely beside the point 
but will nevertheless be misconstrued by all and sundry potatoheads. In this 
case, the later are all professional economists. 

## Extremist MMT Aphorisms

MMT'ers are _not_ economists, they are legal realists and anthropologists, 
despite whatever else they tell you.

Gold has never been money, but the money has sometimes been made of gold.
