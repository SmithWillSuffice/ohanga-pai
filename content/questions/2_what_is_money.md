This post is foundational. I know it is not what leftie activists like to here staraight up. Defiintions about finance and economci systems are for nerds, right?

Wrong. We can pont out severl things both lefties and conservatives get wrong, even when their hearts are in the right place. 
Foremost among these is the [tax payer funding myth.](3_tax_myths.md)

The trouble is, the requisite background to understanding why "tax yaer funding" is an understanding of what money is, in essence, and in practice. 
that's what this article is about.


## Caveats

The posts in this Questions section are not going to trawl through empirical and anthropological data, we've instead  used references where needed. 
It is incumbent upon you to check they are valid and have correct information. 
You can trust me of course, and I'm not thankful if yo do, I'm just happy you do. 
It is better *not to trust me* until you've verified a few of my sources.
The you can thank yourself instead of thanking me, for dong the checking.
