Some fresh MMT education material starts today. I've been posting to the Blog 
recently more regularly, since starting the DougBot Project, and as part of that 
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the 
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.

To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler I first wnated to dip inot a topic dear 
to my heart, which is how MMT applies to poorer nations, so-called "on the periphery" 
of inernational relations.  Could it be MMT does less to help these nations than 
advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or bastardized Keynesian othodoxy equally as 
deluded about the insight of MMT for weaker nations as they are about decent small 
nations like New Zealand?

The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De&nbsp;Conti (2017), 
[Modern Money Theory: a criticism from the periphery](https://www.braziliankeynesianreview.org/BKR/article/download/115/90).
