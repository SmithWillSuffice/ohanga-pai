Some fresh MMT education material starts today. I've been posting to the Blog 
recently more regularly, since starting the 
[DougBot Project](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader), and as part of that 
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the 
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.

To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the 
USA?... well, c'mon, keep up you laggards). 
I first wanted to dip into a topic dear to my heart, which is how MMT applies to 
poorer nations, so-called "on the periphery" of international relations.  Could it be 
MMT does less to help these nations than advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or 
bastardized Keynesian orthodoxy equally as deluded about the insights of MMT for 
weaker nations as they are about decent small nations like New Zealand?

The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De&nbsp;Conti (2017), 
[Modern Money Theory: a criticism from the periphery](https://www.braziliankeynesianreview.org/BKR/article/download/115/90).

If you want to skip the preliminary defences of MMT, which reply to standard criticism, and go staright to the trade issues, then [click here to the Trade Issues](#FairTradeIssues) section.

## They Still Aren't Stating MMT Correctly

Before they get around to their supposed critique of "MMT", Vergnhanini & De&nbsp;Conti 
give a pretty good summary of MMT ideas, however, they fail at the last hurdle, and it is 
not a trivial failure. The trouble being it is central to their (false) arguments 
"against MMT".

The weak chink they point to is Randall Wray's admission that sometimes international 
markets might force a nation to purchase goods for sale in a foreign currency. This 
would be *only* when the weaker nation *needs* critical imports that it cannot source 
domestically or purchase in their own currency. 

However, to argue *on common ground* we have to accept the MMT Base Case, otherwise 
the authors are being disingenuous. The base case is:

1. The (supposedly "weaker") nation is running a fiat currency on a floating exchange rate, no peg, no fixed rate policy.
2. They are maintaining ZIRP --- so any central bank bond issue is zero interest. For 
purposes of running the payments layer only, interbank clearing. (Or not, the MMT 
base case is really that currency issuers never need to offer bonds for sale, private 
banks can be permitted to operate term deposits for customers).
3. The nation runs a Job Guarantee, which supports a base wage floor, 
permanent full employment for anyone wishing to work for the tax credits.

We, they, you, cannot criticize "MMT" if we are not considering all of: ZIRP, 
a fiat float, tax-driven, *and* the Job Guarantee.

What this means is that the "weakness" pointed to by Wray is false. It occurs in the 
present day real world because the nations in the global south are not running job 
guarantee policy, they are instead forcing the poor, the unemployed, to pay the price 
for getting the imports in the foreign currency.

With this all stated, we can see the first mischaracterization by Vergnhanini & De&nbsp;Conti of "MMT", they write,

> <span style="color: grey;">"The [sic.] MMT recognizes that if the country is forced 
to [sic.] international indebtedness because it is obliged to issue debt in a foreign 
currency or because it needs goods or services that are not available in 
exchange for the domestic currency, then it would be subjected to constraints of 
international markets (Wray, 2014a)."</span>

This "recognition" is an opinion and analysis of an MMT economist (Randy Wray) about 
a putative global south nation that is *not running an MMT **Base Case** system*. 
However, they probably still have an MMT system. The lack of following the 
Base Case matters.
Why? It is because under a full MMT Base Case no nation is obliged to issue 
foreign debt. Private citizens and corporations might want to, might do so, but the 
government does not. They can pay all debts in their own currency and have no need 
to borrow a foreign currency.

If "international markets" are obliging the *government* of the weak nation to issue 
foreign debt this is *not* an MMT Base Case, it would be called neocolonialism or 
economic warfare.

The MMT Base Case has to be adjusted, as Wray does so, in the event of international 
warfare.

If the international markets, specifically the FOREX desks, refuse to exchange the 
global south nation's currency for euro or USD, guess who is at fault? Who sparked this 
economic war?

It is not MMT or the global south nation at fault, it is the foreign empires.  
Provided the global south nation are driving domestic demand for their currency via 
taxation, their currency is always worth real value, specifically whatever that 
nation's people can produce for a unit tax credit worth of their labour and industry.

The FOREX rate for that weak nation is thus never zero. It is zero only if imperial 
nations force it to be zero by economic and political warfare.  No nation should 
accept this, and we have something called the United Nations to at least mildly 
act against such imperialism.

It is something else too if that weaker nation is utterly corrupt and has no 
functioning legal system. In that case it's currency is of highly indeterminate 
value, but it is still never zero, so can still be exchanged. Which means they can 
still pay for imports.

They might not get many imports, but that's the real price they pay for corruption 
and lack of rule of law, or rule of fair law.

If one sets up a so-called "periphery nation" that is corrupt as hell to start with, 
then that's not a far criticism of MMT. It is a criticism of that nation's politics. 
MMT still applies if their government want it to apply. They can have as much 
prosperity as their domestic production allows.

What that means is optimising their real terms of trade.

The only condition when the weaker nation cannot optimize it's terms of trade 
(sacrifice some desired domestic output to get critical imports) is when they are 
suffering from out-right economic warfare, like Iran or Cuba.

Incidentally, what nation has the lowest exchange rate against the USD? It is Iran. 
But they have a fair enough justice system. They are a good example of how political 
decision in Washington exerts trade effects upon exchange rates. Yet their people are 
not suffering terribly badly. Their average wage still buys a lot of stuff.
That is the thing about a fiat currency. When apples cost say 20,000 tax credits per
kilogram, but your wage is 50,000,000 tax credits a month, you might be grumpy, but 
you are probably not starving.

### The MMT Base Case is Where to Start
 
All such issues of superimperialism accounted for and acknowledged, what 
is the best policy for the weaker nation to pursue?

In all cases, without exception, it is the MMT Base Case.

The fact the MMT Base Case analysis fails to apply for a weak, corrupt, periphery 
nation held under oppression of imperialism, is not an argument against MMT, and nor 
is it an argument something other than MMT should be their monetary system. In all 
cases they are better off employing MMT operations to run full domestic employment. 
They gain *nothing* in real terms by unemploying their workers.

If their workers are being exploited to produce military munitions for foreigners, 
then MMT is not the problem, the political economic warfare is the problem.

Now I wrote this little section before reading part-3 of Vergnhanini and 
De&nbsp;Conti's paper. I did this because I expected, or hoped, to be surprised that 
they would refute this assertion that regardless of the nation's standing on the 
international stage, they are *still* better off adopting MMT Base Case policy. I was 
prepared to be awed by any counter-argument to this assertion.


## The "General" Criticisms

Let's first see if the general criticisms raised by Vergnhanini & 
De&nbsp;Conti are of any merit (and if not, why are they repeating them?).

1. **Origin of Money** the criticism is that MMT places too much emphasis on 
tax-driven demand. The critics say MMT ignores the secondary functions of: means of 
payment, store of value, and "unit of account". the third of these is a stupid 
critique, since the tax-driven chartal currency *is* the unit of account, so 
Vergnhanini and 
De&nbsp;Conti are off to a poor start, not giving MMT its due. However, the first two 
functions are fully recognized by MMT. Why does a currency attain a store of value 
functional and means of payment function? It's because there is demand. What drives 
that demand is the point in question. MMT does not deny methods *other* than taxes can 
drive demand, see Wray's latest readable book 
[“Making Money Work for Us”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61723716-making-money-work-for-us) and the earlier [“Modern Money Primer”]() and [“Modern Money Theory 101: A reply to critics”](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110016/1/770835929.pdf).
2. **Consolidated Government Framework**  MMT analysis often consolidates central 
bank and treasury, even while acknowledging they have different functions and 
mandates. Marc Lavoie this time, and Palley (again) are called upon as the critics. 
This is again a completely stupid critique. Firstly, MMT recognizes the separation of 
functions (monetary and fiscal policy). But consolidating governmetns is the correct 
framework for the most basic sectoral balances. For when Treasury makes the central 
bank payments, it is the left pocket of government paying the right pocket. Lavoie is 
the fictionalizer here. If Treasury defaults on payments due to the CB it'd be 
entirely pointless, and those   liabilities have zero real economic consequences 
other than exerting some false psychology. It is the false psychology of policy 
makers that is at fault here, not MMT. Lavoie is better to start teaching the 
reality, which is that for many purposes it's a good idea to consolidate government 
in an analysis.
3. **Inflation and Interest Rates Explanation** MMT is "lacking a rigorous 
explanation" says Palley. This is bollocks. Only MMT has an explanation of the 
general price level, which implies also rate of change, i.e., inflation. The general 
framework can be found in Mosler and Forstater, 
[“A general framework for the analysis of currencies and commodities”](http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-General-Analytical-Framework.pdf).  For 
the interest rate the framework is found in another Mosler and Forstater paper, [“The Natural Rate of Interest is Zero”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4228167).
The "L shaped" inflation (Phillips) curve described by MMT is not seen in the real 
world not because MMT is a falwed framework, but because no government runs a Job 
Guarantee labour buffer. If they did, by definition the Phillips curve would flatten, 
it would not even be visibly L-shaped. it would be $-$ shaped. But we will not know 
this empirically 
until some government runs a Job Guarantee policy. However, the theory is solid, and [Bill Mitchell, here: “Full Employment Abandoned: shifting sands and policy failures”](http://www.billmitchell.org/publications/journals/J74_2010.pdf) has plenty of modelling 
to show the basic idea of flattening the Phillips curve.
4. **ZIRP Effects** Tom Palley against asserts ZIRP would lead to asset price 
inflation. This is wrong, or would need to be supported by lax bank credit collateral 
requirements and/or government fiscal injections supporting asset prices. Both 
effects could occur, and do occur. But MMT is not at fault here. How does a monetary 
authority prevent asset price inflations caused by ZIRP? Firstly, ZIRP does not cause 
anything, since the natural rate is zero. It therefore must be the regulatory policy 
government bank lending and collateral that supports rising asst prices. MMT suggests 
the role of government should be to better regulate banks, not use interest rates. 
Palley cannot ever deny this is true, unless sit is tried and does not work. But of 
course regulating banks would work, if enforced, if not corrupted. So is the 
"critique" of MMT that in the real world governments are corrupt? That'd be highly 
disingenuous, since it is not a critique of MMT, it'd be a critique of certain 
governments. This is, to their credit, acknowledged 
by Vergnhanini and De&nbsp;Conti, so is recognized as not a valid critique of MMT.
5. **Floating Exchange Rate** This critique is the more *apropo* for Vergnhanini and 
De&nbsp;Conti's paper. Tom Palley again is resuscitated from the vampire crypt to 
attack MMT, he claims floating exchange rates are insufficient to "insulate" a small 
open economy from pass-through effects of inflation. this attack misses the mark by a 
country mile, because the purpose of MMT informed policy for a small open economy is 
not price stability, it is full employment. Price stability can be abandoned 
indefinitely. Few critics of MMT understand this, and many MMT advocates also fail to 
appreciate the purpose of price stability. Price stability is a political goal, not 
an economic goal. The economic goal is a gradual improvement in the *real wage*, and 
that can occur with any inflation level that is tolerated by political psychology. 
The limits here are entirely political, not monetary, not real resources.
Since you will not see this in most standard MMT literature, I will reference the 
analysis of the Weimar hyperinflation by 
[Armstrong and Mosler](https://gimms.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Weimar-Republic-Hyperinflation-through-a-Modern-Monetary-Theory-Lens.pdf). It should suffice,

It you take issue with any of these defences of MMT or the references let me know after 
[donating here](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/) so I can justify the time responding 
to your argument.


## Fair Trade Issues {#FairTradeIssues}

Here we are at the critical point where the critique of Vergnhanini and 
De&nbsp;Conti coalesces with a similar critique of MMT by friend Steve Keen. The MMT 
case is that _imports are a **real** benefit, and exports are a **real** cost_. The issue 
is that some post-Keynesians see this as "too simplistic". However, they ignore the 
macroeconomics point of MMT, which is based on realism about the Base Case for 
Analysis (no imperial despots, floating exchange rates, fiat currency driven by tax 
liabilities). Under the Base Case it is a truism that imports are real benefits 
and exports are real costs.

Steve Keen, for his ill part, oftens leaves off the qualifier "real", and so false 
frames the debate into monetary terms. Certainly, allowing foreigners to accumulate 
your currency means they can buy your goods. But MMT would counter that this is no 
risk unless governments make it a risk.  Goods you produce domestically do not 
*have* to be for sale to foreigners.

Keen also raises the "de-industrialization" fear-mongering. But why would being a net 
importer mean you *have* to de-industrialize? It means no such thing. Anything that 
can be produced at more expense domestically can be sourced domestically, if that is 
desired for strategic reasons. So this is not a fair critique of MMT, because such 
strategic resource policies are entirely up to governments to choose. They may choose 
right or wrong for their people, regardless of what MMT teaches them. Better to 
regard MMT, I say.

The purpose is to optimize your **_real_** terms of trade, not your current account 
balances, which for governments are mere accounting records.  Any nation may optimize 
their real terms of trade.  That does not mean all can be net importers, which is an 
impossible state, there must be at least one net exporter, by capital account 
balances.
That country is still seeking to get as many quality imports it can get for the 
minimal amount they can export. Or, at least, that's what they ought to be doing in 
trade negotiations. There's no telling for what ignorance will accomplish.

If you drop the qualifier "real" then you'll misunderstand. The money becomes unimportant 
in this case (since there is assumed no imperialism).

You may, like Steve Keen or Michael Hudson, still get it wrong if you are thinking in 
currency terms and *fixed exchange rates* instead of real terms an floating exchange 
rates.  The trade risk is never nominal inflation. The risk is running out of real 
resources, that is to say, the risk should be thought of in terms of real inflation 
(eroding of the purchasing power of the annual wage).

Under MMT, there are still two major factors that can erode the *real* wage:

1. **Rentiers** --- rent extraction to the top One Percent, which is tantamount to stolen 
wages from the working class, although MMT generally is taken to subsume Keynes, so you'd 
be euthanizing your rentiers, would you not? So not much of a risk factor for an MMT 
informed government wishing to protect *all* their people.
2. **Imperialists** --- a large nation simply refuses to trade with you. MMT is not going 
to help here, but nor is any other school of economic thought, so you might as well 
adhere to MMT policy and at least maximise domestic non-bullsh*t output.

Unemployment directly reduces output too, eroding the real wage, but that's not going to 
happen in the MMT Base Case, so it is not a risk factor.

You might include other risks like plagues, droughts, asteroid strikes, war, general 
stupidity and educational dumbing down and whatnot. All of which can erode the 
real wage potentially. 
If you can foresee these, then definitely include them in policy planning to mitigate 
the foreseeable erosion of real wages.


Under an international imperialist despot (like the USA) of course this simple story 
can get twisted,. But this is hardly a fault or flaw in MMT. If you do not like 
imperialism then failing to adopt an MMT system and policies will not help you, it'll 
make things worse.
Remember, *any* pass-through effects of inflation can be tolerated indefinitely for a 
monopoly currency issuer.

The problem is getting other nations who have things to sell to accept your currency. 
If they will not accept your currency then you need to swap on the FOREX market, 
which if done on a mass scale risks currency depreciation and pass-through inflation. 
However, that inflation can go on forever. There is no limit, provided the domestic 
currency is fiat and on a float. 

In severe cases the FOREX market will not even accept your currency, in which case 
you have bigger problems than monetary economics. Almost all nations today can 
operate a FOREX desk, and should always find takers for their currency if they are 
imposing domestic tax liabilities payable only in their unit of account. (The 'unit 
of account' being equivalent to the tax credit, which was misunderstood by Palley in 
the note above --- the state unit of account need not be the tax credit, but almost 
invariably is!)

The better way to understand all this is to understand the purpose of exporting real 
goods: the exports pay for the imports. They are a price you pay for keeping 
pass-through inflation under control while receiving a few nice imports.

The way to remove the damaging neoliberal psychological effect of inflation is to 
raise domestic production over time. You cannot do this any better than with full domestic employment, so you will *need* MMT in both theory and practice.

It is possible benign rich nations could gift you imports. Or they might lend at zero 
interest rate. That'd obviate the need for an exchange rate float, but who is ever going 
to rely on such a commonwealth? Nice if you can get it.

What about trade embargoes, like those imposed upon Cuba? 

Even here, Cuba is best advised to run an MMT system. There is no benefit to doing 
otherwise. Why unemploy your workers just because some other nation is not trading 
with you? It'd be like penalizing your dog for stepping in your neighbours doodoo.
