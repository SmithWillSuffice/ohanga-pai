Some fresh MMT education material starts today. I've been posting to the Blog 
recently more regularly, since starting the DougBot Project, and as part of that 
research effort the opportunity to pose some questions to the founder of MMT (in the 
modern 20th century form, as opposed to the Sumerian form) arose.

To prepare for a chat with Sir Warren Mosler (you guys have Knighthoods yet in the 
USA?... well, c'mon, keep up you laggards). 
I first wanted to dip into a topic dear to my heart, which is how MMT applies to 
poorer nations, so-called "on the periphery" of international relations.  Could it be 
MMT does less to help these nations than advertised? Or is the New Keynesian or 
bastardized Keynesian orthodoxy equally as deluded about the insights of MMT for 
weaker nations as they are about decent small nations like New Zealand?

The paper this discussion is based upon is by Vergnhanini and De&nbsp;Conti (2017), 
[Modern Money Theory: a criticism from the periphery](https://www.braziliankeynesianreview.org/BKR/article/download/115/90).

## They Still Aren't Stating MMT Correctly

Before they get around to their supposed critique of "MMT", Vergnhanini & De&nbsp;Conti 
give a pretty good summary of MMT ideas, however, they fail at the last hurdle, and it is 
not a trivial failure. The trouble being it is central to their (false) arguments 
"against MMT".

The weak chink they point to is Randall Wray's admission that sometimes international 
markets might force a nation to purchase goods for sale in a foreign currency. This 
would be *only* when the weaker nation *needs* critical imports that it cannot source 
domestically or purchase in their own currency. 

However, to argue *on common ground* we have to accept the MMT Base case, otherwise 
the authors are being disingenuous. The base case is:

1. The supposedly "weaker" nation is running a fiat currency on a floating exchange rate, 
no peg, no fixed rate policy.
2. They are maintaining ZIRP --- so any central bank bond issue is zero interest. For 
purposes of running the payments layer only, interbank clearing. (Or not, the MMT 
base case is really that currency issuers never need to offer bonds for sale, private 
banks can be permitted to operate term deposits for customers).
3. The weaker nation runs a Job Guarantee, which supports a base wage floor, 
permanent full employment for anyone wishing to work for the tax credits.

We, they, cannot criticize "MMT" if they are not considering both ZIRP *and* the 
Job Guarantee.

What this means is that the "weakness" pointed to by Wray is false. It occurs in the 
present day real world because the nations in the global south are not running Job 
guarantee policy, thy ar instead forcing the poor, the unemployed, to pay the price for 
getting the imports in the foreign currency.

With this all stated, we can see the first mischaracterization by of "MMT", they write,

> <span style="color: grey;">"The MMT recognizes that if the country is forced to 
international indebtedness because it is obliged to issue debt in a foreign currency 
or because it needs goods or services that are not available in 
exchange for the domestic currency, then it would be subjected to constraints of 
international markets (Wray, 2014a)."</span>

This "recognition" is an opinion and analysis of an MMT economist (Randy Wray) about 
a putative global south nation that is not running an MMT system. Why? It is because 
under a full MMT Base Case no nation is obliged to issue foreign debt. Private 
citizens and corporation might want to, might do so, but the government does not. 
They can pay all debts in their own currency and have no need to borrow a foreign 
currency.

If "international markets" are obliging the *government* of the weak nation to issue 
foreign debt this is *not* an MMT Base Case, it would be called neocolonialism or 
economic warfare.

The MMT Base Case has to be adjusted, as Wray does so, in the event of international 
warfare.

If the international markets, specifically the FOREX desks, refuse to exchange the global 
south nation's currency for euro or USD, guess who is at fault?

It is not MMT or the global south nation at fault, it is the foreign empires.  
Provided the global south nation are driving domestic demand for their currency via 
taxation, their currency s always worth real value, specifically whatever that 
nation's people can produce for a unit tax credit worth of their labour and industry.

The FOREX rate for that weak nation is thus never zero. It is zero only if imperial 
nations force it to be zero by economic and political warfare.  No nation should 
accept this, and we have something called the Untied Nations to at least mildly 
action against such imperialism.

It is something else too if that waker nation is utterly corrupt and has no 
functioning legal system. In that case it's currency is of highly indeterminate 
value, but it is still never zero, so can still be exchanged. Which means they can 
still pay for imports.

They might not get many imports, but that's the real price they pay for corruption and lack of rule of law, or rule of fair law.

If one sets up a so-called "periphery nation" that is corrupt as hell to start with, 
then that's not a far criticism of MMT.  It is a criticism of that nation's politics. 
MMT still applies if their government want it to apply. They can have as much 
prosperity as their domestic production allows.

What that means is optimising their real terms of trade.

They only condition when the weaker nation cannot optimize it's terms of trade 
(sacrifice some desired domestic output to get critical imports) is when they are 
suffering from out-right economic warfare, like Iran or Cuba.

Incidentally, what nation has the lowest exchange rate against the USD? It is Iran. 
But they have a fair enough justice system. They are a good example of how political 
decision in Washington effect trade effects upon exchange rates. Yet their people are 
not suffering terribly badly. There average wage still buys a lot of stuff.
That is the thing about a fiat currency. When apples cost say 20,000 tax credits per  
kilogram, but your wage is 50,000,000 tax credits a month, you might be grumpy, but 
you are probably not starving.
