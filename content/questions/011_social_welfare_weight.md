You may have come across the economics concept of "social welfare deadweight". 
If so, commiserations, you've been reading fake economics.  In this article 
I will provide an MMT lens counter to that language framing and the 
whole concept. The one liner take-way is that _social welfare is neither 
a cost nor a benefit, it all depends on the policy design._

Cretins running the government will likely mean terrible social policy, 
decent people running government will likely mean decent public policy.
That is all there is to say.
With an MMT lens --- the number of the numeraire figures in the 
government budget not important --- the rest is fine print.

The framing of "social welfare as a dead weight" is one of the most deeply 
ideological and poorly examined assumptions in mainstream (neoclassical) 
economics. Let's use an MMT and heterodox economics lens to reframe this 
concept and show how well-designed social welfare is _not_ a dead weight — 
and can, in fact, be a form of productive public investment.

## The “Deadweight Loss” Concept --- Where it comes from

In orthodox economics, “dead-weight loss” refers to a loss in total economic 
efficiency --- usually when prices are distorted (e.g., taxes, subsidies, 
minimum wages, welfare transfers). The idea is that welfare programs 
discourage work and production, leading to inefficiencies.

But this relies on _very narrow assumptions_, like (i) people are rational 
utility maximizers focused only on income, (ii) market outcomes are optimal 
by default, (iii) government spending is funded by taxes and crowds out 
private activity, (iv) welfare induces laziness (the “moral hazard” story).

**None of this is empirically accurate --- it's ideological.** It’s a 
model-world abstraction designed to preserve a market supremacy narrative.


## An MMT Heterodox Reframing

**Short format:* _Welfare as an enabler, not a Burden._

From an MMT perspective, government spending is not constrained by taxes 
or other revenues. The revenues are in fact revenue --- "return back to the 
issuer." in the literal sense, not the exchange sense.

For a private business sales are ‘revenue’ in the ‘exchange-for’ sense: the 
businesses labour is swapped for currency. This is not so for a government 
that is a monopoly issuer of the tax credit.

What matters is whether spending uses real resources effectively and supports 
public purpose.  Welfare transfer payments are one of 
the **automatic stabilizers** --- the expand in downturns, contracts in 
upswings, buffering the economy.

From a functional finance lens (Abba Lerner):

> The role of fiscal policy is not to balance the budget, but to balance 
the economy --- at full employment and stable prices.

So social welfare is, (a) a stabilizer of aggregate demand, (b) a source of 
dignity and social cohesion, or at least the potential for some dignity, 
(c) an investment in long-run capacity, especially when it includes:

* Health care
* Education
* Childcare
* Housing
* Nutrition
* Disability or elder support

These are all things that increase human capability, which --- if you want 
to be a crass econ nerd about it --- is the primary productive resource 
in any economy.

Besides, are any of these public services really "welfare"? Or are they 
merely smart economic choices of good governance?  If you like "welfare" 
then by all means consider this list all "social welfare". No argument 
from me. 

You can use whatever semantics you like I suppose. I prefer the 
"public services" language framing. Welfare should be on top of these, and 
kept to a minimum, not because it is bad to have social welfare programs, 
but because we should not need them in the fist place. 

What perhaps might distinguish a "capitalist MMT ideologue" from 
a "socialist MMT ideologue" is debate over how to minimize social welfare. 
Here I am far more on the socialist side, not that this should worry you, 
just in case you wanted to know. I'm not writing about the "why?" of that 
today.



## Welfare as “Social ROI” --- not a cst, but a multiplier

Let's spit put more of the crassness! Why not? The econ nerds gotta feed.

Economists like James Galbraith, Mariana Mazzucato, and dumb-dumb 
sociologist Guy Standing ---  none of whom understand MMT -- have 
have argued that:

* Social spending creates future productivity by reducing precarity, 
stress, and crime.
* Investing in children’s welfare, maternal health, education, etc. yields 
huge returns later.
* Even cash transfers often increase **local economic activity**, as 
recipients spend on local needs.

Despite getting monetary operations all wrong, I actually agree with those 
three nerds on these points. I think everyone can.

In MMT terms, if we’re not at full employment, then idle real resources 
exist --- including unemployed people. If a welfare system enables those 
people to live, train, or care for dependents while society transitions 
or recovers, there’s no dead weight. In fact, there’s long-term gain.

However, I only care about the employment condition. When people are 
contributing fully to their community than that is enough. We do not need 
to define "full employment" in terms of capital equipment and energy 
maximization. Indeed it would be stupid to do so. Because no one truly knows 
what the Planetary Boundaries really are, so the wise thing is to operate 
society well within energy and capital equipment and materials full capacity.

Thus,

> _From a dirtbag MMT perspective, **full employment** only refers to 
**optimal** use of human labour._

That means totally minimizing the use of human labour. Produce what 
everyone needs for a decent life, and no more than that, but again, since 
no one can compute what that is, our government policy has to wing it a 
bit, and provide the appropriate buffers. The Job Guarantee is the 
appropriate buffer, not a regressive pittance of a UBI.


### Why Does the “Dead Weight” Story Persist?

Well, just imho, the “welfare burden” narrative is a political tool, not 
an economic truth. It serves at least four decrepit ends in my view, 
(maybe more?):

* Justify austerity
* Discipline labour
* Shrink the public sphere
* Demonize poverty as a moral failure

It fits into the larger narrative that only "unobstructed markets" produce 
value, and that public support is inherently wasteful. But that’s an 
ideological commitment --- not a logical one, and certainly not empirical.

If anything the reverse is true. Take the SPX as just one proxy for a 
successful market indicator. The SPX growth tracks government net debt, 
almost to a ridiculously strong correlation degree. While in statistics where 
there is smoke there is fire is definitely not true, you always have to 
wonder. Could it be that rising government debt promotes a stronger SPX?

I would say yes.

### Better Framing: Welfare as Economic Infrastructure

We should reframe social welfare as:

* **Preventative macro policy** (stabilization and resilience)
* **Social insurance** (risk-sharing across time and population)
* **Public investment** (in human and community capacity)

A good one-liner from an MMT lens might be:

> _“Social welfare isn’t a burden on the economy --- it’s a foundation 
for a fair economy. When the government spends to ensure basic well-being, 
it’s not draining the productive sector --- it’s sustaining and enabling 
fair capacity.”_

Or more provocatively:

> _“The only dead weight is an economy that lets real resources --- 
especially people --- go to waste.”_


## Bonus: Job Guarantee as a Bridge Between Welfare and Work

The MMT style _base case_ Job Guarantee can be copnsidered a direct response 
to this “dead weight” framing. The Transition Job provides (1) a buffer-stock 
of employed labor instead of unemployed labor. (2) Offers transition work, 
purpose, and local value. (3) Anchors the currency and wage floor without 
coercion or exclusion. (4) In principle forever eliminates the bitter 
struggle for survival.

This replaces the atrocious framing “welfare vs. work” 
with **public option for employment for public purpose**, and further 
exposes how false the deadweight idea really is.

Basically, in summary, even if we ignore all the social pathologies of 
unemployment, or MMT base case (most braind dead simple policy option) 
has econ-nerd advanatges evena  neocliassical could comprehend:

1. Social welfare stabilizes demand.
2. It enhances human capacity and reduces future social costs.
3. It can be a pro-green-growth, pro-equity, and inflation-sensitive
part of fiscal policy.
4. And crucially: it doesn’t need to be "funded" by taxes, or ratehr, 
is _never_ funded by tax payments.


A **5.** on this list woudl go on for a while with all the pathologies of 
unemployment that get wiped away, liek generational poverty running through 
families, depression, anxiety, suicide adn all the rest.
