There is some confusion about trade balances resulting in gaslighting of 
MMT even by some friendlies. After the "debate" between Warren Mosler and 
Steve Keen hosted on Real Progressives some years ago, one might think the 
ProfKeen side-show of MMT friendlies who are really post-Keynesians, might 
have settled matters, but perhaps not. Hence the feeling (not the 
analytical necessity) of writing this entry circa 2023, well after it 
should not need to be written.

## The Logical Case

Let's lay out a base case.

**Assumption 1.** When an entity receives real goods it pays for, 
presumably it is not being forced to pay. There can be exceptions, and we 
will address these later.

**Assumption 2.** If an entity is not being forced to pay, presumably the 
goods it receives are a benefit. (The no-madness assumption.)

**Assumption 3.** Regardless of trade balance, if real terms of trade are 
being optimised, and the nation's currency is a non-convertible fiat currency 
on a floating exchange rate, then *any and all* deteriorations of the real 
terms of trade can be compensated for with appropriate domestic distributional 
policy adjustments.


**Assumption 4.** Behind actually *implementing* Assumption **3** is the 
implicit further assumption foreigners and export oligarchs are not dictating 
your domestic policy.

**Assumption 4.** Full employment policy is assumed here to be run via a 
Job Guarantee (JG) buffer. This means the lowest wage jobs serve a public 
purpose. The MMT base case would permit non-profits ad charities that serve 
a clear enough public purpose (democratically defined) to employ anyone 
opting in to the JG.

It is a logical consequence that when the entity paying is "a nation" then,
**(i)** imports are a real benefit, exports are a real cost.   
**(ii)** Imports are a currency cost, exports are a currency benefit.

> Your exports pay for your imports. The macroeconomic policy should be to 
optimise the real terms of trade. (Import as much as possible that is desired 
for as few exports as possible.)


### Why are the real terms of trade primary?

Financial and market instability will typically (or likely) result if 
production conditions deteriorate, and with a fixed exchange rate or 
currency peg, the nation has to then reduce domestic demand in order to 
achieve stability.

But this is needless and regressive, and frankly idiotic. Why put people out 
of work in order to stabilise a desired exchange rate or currency conversion 
policy?  If tax liabilities are sufficiently driving demand for the 
state currency then a fixed exchange rate or currency peg can be done 
away with, and full employment can be the policy.

While full employment maximises potential domestic output, and is 
anti-inflationary (provided the jobs achieve or support desired output), one 
might still ask how this can stabilise the economy? The answer is with a 
Job Guarantee buffer policy. This is well-established MMT policy design, 
not the subject of this article. 

With a non-convertible fiat currency and floating exchange rate, the 
government is not currency constrained, so can allow the government net 
spending to float, the "deficit" can be whatever it needs to be to sustain 
full employment. This permits policy options for optimising real terms of 
trade. The "nation" need not sell goods that it desires to consume 
domestically, unless it cannot produce other critical goods it desires to 
consume (normally, for a small resource poor nation, these might be certain 
foods, hi-tech, energy, water, medicines, and so forth).

However, there is no public purpose served for such resource poor nations 
in adopting an unemployed labour buffer. They will better optimise their 
real terms of trade with full employment.

Under the JG buffer the wage-demand inflationary impact largely goes away 
(and arguably empirically has never been a cause of inflation${}^\ast$, certainly 
never hyperinflation as acknowledged even by right-wing analysts at the 
CATO Institute).

${}^\ast$This is not to say strong wage demands cannot ever cause run-away 
inflation, but historically and pragmatically, wage demands are going to be 
one-off price adjustments, or at worst periodic discrete adjustments, 
not continual pressures on the price level.

The current account balance (the net "flow" of domestic currency 
"overseas"${}^\dagger$) whether positive or negative is of absolutely no 
concern for a government informed by MMT. 

${}^\dagger$Note: state currency never "flows" overseas. The accounts stay 
at the issuing bank. It is whose name on the accounts that changes. 
Even cash (paper and coin) that are in wallets in a foreign territory are 
IOU's of the issuing state, and they are best thought of as detached records 
on the central bank balance sheet.

Why not? Why is a governemtn advised to not be concerned about the current 
account balance?  It is because the policy is full employment and price 
stability. Targetting some "desired" current account balance serves no public 
purpose whatsoever.  It is the information about the balance, and the rate of 
change, that is useful information, not the current value.

The current account merely reflects partial information about healthiness of 
trade, and little more absent other information about distributive effects. 
Obviously a healthier trade balance (superior optimised real terms of trade) 
is desirable, but it need have no effect at all on domestic full employment.

Furthermore, the distributional effects can *always and without question* 
be addressed by domestic political policy adjustment (fiscal adjustment).
It is a matter of political will, and power, not markets or financing. If 
you prefer, it *is* a market thing: the market for votes in parliaments 
and such-like. But it is not irrevocably linked to any financial, industrial 
or retail markets. (It is linked of course in realpolitik today by false 
psychology, which is why we typically experience adverse highly skewed 
distributional effects when terms of trade deteriorate.)


## The Realist Case

I'm not going to exhaustively list pertinent facts, we only need a few 
to establish the "anti-MMT" case, such as it is.

**Fact 1.** Poorer nations get screwed. By various means, to be specific, 
one is they are coerced by various forces into export-led growth models.

The various forces include:
* Their exporters --- not the best people to have around trade negotiations. 
Their interest is in the foreign buyer, and in suppressing domestic ages.
* False psychology --- Ha-Joon Chang, among others, writes about how 
export-led growth is a false paradigm, and insidious. 
* Other political factors.

All are unrelated to the MMT base case, all are political and power elite 
forces that distort fair trade relations.

**Fact 2.** Obviously some weaker nations are receiving real goods they
are forced to purchase, and in other circumstances would not wish to nor 
need to purchase.

**Fact 3.** Same goes for exporting, some nations are exporting goods they would 
otherwise not need to export, nor even desire to produce.

Even the USA. The USA currently produces as much oil as it needs, I believe, 
yet still imports oil. You ask why? I can only hazard a guess this is because 
there is no oil monopoly operating in the USA, so different oil producers are 
dealing with different buyers, some foreign, some domestic.

This is a shame, because given energy and petrochemical derivatives are 
vital base economic feedstocks, it would make so much more sense to consolidate 
this one industry if none other. Reduce the inefficiencies of competition, 
and stabilise oil and derivative feedstock prices.

Do we need any other factoids?


## Realism aught not conflict with logic

If we have a disagreement then it's not some dopey Hegelian or Marxian 
"contradiction". It is just something is wrong with your thinking.
One or the other side, or both, are wrong.

To sort such things out --- and it might not be possible --- we could start 
with examining any subjective assumptions, or hidden assumptions, and in 
particular search for any straw-man arguments.  If the MMT position is being 
straw-manned, then it might be possible to clear that air and note MMT is 
agreed correct.

In the case of heterodox economists like ProfKeen there is a straw-maning 
of MMT.

1. Firstly, ProfKeen often miss-states the MMT position, he says, "exports are 
a cost, imports are a benefit."  But this is **_not_** the MMT statement, in 
fact it is exactly the *opposite* of MMT.   
The MMT position is:
> Exports area *real cost* and imports ar ea *real benefit*.

Clearly, by the exchange of goods for currency, the exports are a nominal benefit and imports are a nominal cost, which is how ProfKeen states it, but dropping the word "nominal".

> You cannot drop the qualifiers "nominal" or "real" because then you are 
risking getting things utterly backwards. Certainly, it is  meaningless 
statement to say "exports are a cost, imports a benefit" this means nothing, 
because it lacks the units or type of that which is going offshore and that 
which comes onshore.
