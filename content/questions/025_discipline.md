I've written a few basic books on MMT questions and nuances, for the average 
reader, they're not technical. But in this article I wanted to mention some 
things outside my area of expertise.

These can be important in some MMT activist activities, mainly when you run 
across some experts who know more than you. The trouble occurs when they do 
not know much about MMT, and have formed half-baked ideas about MMT.

This is a dangerous brew, so one option is to not engage. You might of course be 
wrong in the expert area of this other character, so even if you are right about 
MMT, this can cause you pain. We're talking about the infamous Ramanan types 
(a blogger who scribbled on Randall L. Wrays' old new economics perspectives 
articles comments section).

The other possibility is this other character, let's give her a name, say 
Kathleen Pinetos, or just Kathy for short, seems like a decent person not out to 
cause you pain. Then a nice thing for your own edification might be to engage, 
and suffer any bondage and discipline that results. Should make you a stronger 
MMT activist.

I cannot cover all such eventualities, but I've a got a short list for you. If 
you'd like to add a section let me know, and even better, tell me about your war 
stories.

## Big Picture

The aim, if I were to engage a potentially monster anti-MMT attack dog, is to 
learn and grow. It is ok to be called "asinine" or "ignorant" and such like, 
since we are after all coming from an entirely off mainstream paradigm.
So that's the first tip:
> Expect pain, but don't let it knock you out, welcome it.

It is a truly heinous drag to battle with a 
mainstream expert who probably agrees 90% with you on most things, and yet you 
fail to see this space of conciliation. I've gone against this advice on several 
occasions, once with a bitcoin enthusiast, once with an Austrian School or 
libertarian random bloke: "Maybe don't poison the well," was their parting gift. 
They were right, I had made engagement impossible by referring to an entire 
school of thought as *idiots*. I was probably correct, but it served no useful 
purpose to let them know what I thought if my real purpose was to get across 
a few more MMT points in a congenial manner. 
Second tip:
> Tip 2. Find points of unity.

Another frustrating thing you might not see as a thing, is when this Kathy 
makes a valid argument or derivation. You might not know the assumption that is 
false in her premises. You'll then be inclined to argumentation, if her conclusion 
violates MMT thought (supposing your MMT analysis is not flawed here, be humble 
and admit it could be flawed). It is never a good idea in my experience to not 
accept a valid argument. But it is painful to be patient enough to trace a bad 
conclusion back to a faulty premise.
> Tip 3: be prepared to be patient and trace back an argument you think has a 
terrible conclusion back to a false premise. Point out the premise is wrong or 
disputable, not the form of the derivation of the argument (The logic is correct, 
one assumption is wrong).

I do not want to write a long boring Logic-101 listicle thing, so I'll leave 
further common-sense big picture stuff for you to fill in yourself. For my own 
insecurity I just need to write such obvious stuff to mind myself I'm not 
completely clueless when it comes to human social interaction. 

We need some juicy examples now.

## MMT â‡’ Non-convertible currency

A non-convertible fiat currency is merely 
**_an MMT base case for analysis._**

But do not let Kathy tell you this is a goofy assumption. It's just a base case, 
and can be the case. If it is not the case then the government fiscal policy space 
is smaller. The MMT point is why the heck is your government offering 
convertibility?

### An MMT meme

Sometimes the meme's are great. When Kiwis import from China, someone gets NZD. 
If that is a Chinese firm, say, and they are happy to hold NZD, then someone in 
China will probably be swapping those NZDs for NZ Treasury bonds.

What do we now owe China? **_We owe China a bank statement._**


### Why convertible?

An actual real world answer is that your government is signed up to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Treaty, which has an Article VIII, Section 4., 
requiring your government to buy it's own currency back in return for Special 
Drawing Rights (SDRs or the other nation's currency (should your government hold 
the records or bonds in the other nation's currency).

((It kinda' makes some dopey sense for monetarists. Maybe the other guy just 
doesn't like holding on to your government's IOU. But there is also the 
political shenanigan reason: MMT'er: "it's not like you 
can be forced to default." Kathy: "but states have defaulted for 
political reasons."))

The MMT reply is that this has very little practical consequence. Currency swapped 
for currency is not something that fiscally constrains your government, so it is 
just a giant ball of nothing.

If the currency is on a float, then any minor economic consequences of such a 
convertibility obligation can always be adjusted with appropriate fiscal 
policy. The main point is that full employment is not under any threat.

"Ah," but Kathy the expert says, "what about the terrible political consequences?"

The response to this is covered by **Tip 4** above.

Oh, dash it, I stopped writing tips.  Here it is then:
> Tip 4. The MMT base case presumes government understands MMT. If they do 
not then bad political decisions can get made, with severe economic 
consequences. This is not a fault of MMT operations that are in effect. 

It comes under the category of, "Guns don't kill people." But you do not want to 
put it that way, since MMT monetary operations are not the analogue of the gun 
here! Careful which metaphors you choose!
How about, 
"**_I did not tell you to put your shoes on first before your socks, did I?_**"

MMT is --- we've got shoes and socks so we don't mangle our feet on 
long walks.

Kathy is --- but people might put their socks over their ears, and stick 
their shoes on their hands.

## Semantic Squabbles

Boy do we get a lot of these.

### Savings is Not Savings

You might find a lot of econ Bro's complaining at MMT acolytes that the meme, 
"**_Government deficits equate to non-government sector net savings_**"
is "dumb" or "goofy" or "just wrong."

Do not let them gaslight you.

Someone can save in fluffy bunnies, bottled water, or bitcoins, or gold, 
or anything reasonably non-perishable (some even consider their house to be a 
form of savings).

But this does not alter the fact there is a strong anxiety and thus psychological 
need to save in NZD (or USD for USA citizens, and so forth). Why? Because of the 
pervasive pressure of the *ongoing* tax liabilities.

If the tax liabilities, or the means to enforce them, go away, then MMT'ers 
imagine (for good reason) pretty soon after not many people will be saving in 
the state currency units. 

This dynamic is contestable, perhaps enough inertia has gathered that banks will 
still issue NZD. But this'd be an interesting natural experiment to see play out. 
Until such a natural experiment occurs one has to theorise, "What the heck caused 
the loss of taxation?" It'd have to be 
pretty dire! So are state chartered banks even still a thing?

We have empirical evidence from recent history (just in the last 4000 years)  
that states which lose tax authority have a currency that rapidly falls 
to zero exchange value. Causal analysis anyone?
