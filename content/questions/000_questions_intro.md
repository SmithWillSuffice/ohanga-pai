This section [Questions](../) is for mostly philosophical discussions (in article 
form). Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy 
and fiscal versus monetary policy. For public banking (really just banking in 
general) I've drawn heavily upon the prior work of 
[Warren Mosler,](http://moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/) [Randall Wray,](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/modern-monetary-theory-primer.html) 
and Eric Tymoigne. 

For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and 
[Bill Mitchell](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/) & [Pavlina Tcherneva](http://pavlina-tcherneva.net/job-guarantee-faq/).
For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon 
[Money on the Left](https://moneyontheleft.org/) and 
[Stephanie Kelton @Market Watch.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/best-new-ideas-in-money/id1587222768) 
For numerical simulations the best foundations are found in the work of 
[Steve Keen](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/) and 
[Matheus Grasselli](https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/mgrasselli) --- who 
use sophisticated modern money Goodwin--Minsky models but which include banks, so are 
at a minimum three-sector models --- as well as the guides by 
[Ty Keynes](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModellingwithMinsky) which can help get you 
started with simulation dynamics software.

Contributors are welcome, but will need to submit through the 
[Contact](/contact/) form. 

Just keep in mind Ōhanga Pai is more a developers repository, not an activists forum. Activists are welcome to use any of our software, it is all free-libre software under the

### Caveats

At the end of most articles on this website I will try to list essential caveats. 
These will mostly be of the nature "I'm not an expert here." 
But for this introductory post you can easily tell which statements are 
factual and which are my opinions, so there are no further caveats needed for 
this one.
