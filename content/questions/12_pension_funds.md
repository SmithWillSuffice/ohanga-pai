In this chapter we take a look at superannuation schemes, why they are useless 
today and maybe even harmful, and why they *were* at one time useful in the past. 

Up-front, to avoid you going away immediately, I will say superannuation funds 
are not harmful if governments running the schemes do not use them to create 
mass unemployment. The trouble is they do! Yet it's just a policy mistake, so can 
be corrected. So we will learn why they should not make the policy error in the first place!
