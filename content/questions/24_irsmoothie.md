Internet friend Derek McDaniel posted some 
[interesting stuff on Medium](https://derek7mc.medium.com/how-raising-rates-smooths-inflation-929bd37ae9e3) 
worth writing about. I'll use it as an entry into some wider issues of a continued 
massive need for MMT awareness. Right, as if we don't all know this need! What am I 
doing here? Trying to activate activated activists?

## If "You" are the Government

... or a monopoly currency issuer, driving demand for your currency with coercive tax liabilities or similar means.

Given this, one way Derek points out for limiting inflation is to pull cash out 
of circulation by issuing bonds (Treasury securities). MMT helps simplify by 
noting a Tsy bond is simply a very secure savings account or term deposit 
(government guaranteed).

If you wish to get bogged down in legal niceties, hey, be my guest, but what I do is 
write from an MMT lens for the generic nation, so I am not considering the insanity 
of US Treasury needing a nominal positive balance in Its account at the FED to make 
legal payments --- with all the subsequent repo and reverse repo fidgeting.

We can instead assume Treasury and Central Bank are consolidated, so 
if the CB payments guys demand money from the Treasury gals, they can just use an 
over-draft. It's Left Pocket of government owing the Right Pocket of government.

This MMT consolidation followed by a latter apparent separation 
(left-pocket/right-pocket) is important because the records need to be kept track of, 
to prevent fraud, and to allow public oversight.

### Then You can do many things to limit inflation

The particular case I am going to imagine (only in my imagination) Derek was perhaps 
considering is when the inflation is being driven by a supply shock event, like a 
pandemic, or a war, famine, asteroid strike, hurricane, oligopoly price gouging, 
oil monopoly, fresh drinking water monopolist (who could that nest l√© be?), or 
whatever.

In this case a supply contraction means existing purchasing power (effective demand) 
is going to cause a market problem in *some* relative price adjustment upwards. If 
severe enough this can bleed into other sectors and cause a general increase n the 
price level, or at least blips in the CPI that become sustained and do not drop back 
down too fast.

Add to this the problem that when consumers get accustomed to higher prices, the 
firms tend to stay at the current level. Although no firms like losing out, they also 
do not want to lose customers. But if the consumer sentiment is for permanent upward 
price adjustment no firm will loose too many customers if they stay at the upwards 
adjusted price. Only a few firms tend t drop back down to previous prices when the 
supply shock ends. In this way price inflation is a bit of a ratchet. Mainstream 
economists call it "sticky prices" with is a dopey metaphor, bu it makes the same 
point, if you like some obscurity as a cost for getting fewer words.

### Why not invest to boost supply?

Why not indeed. This would be an MMT "preferred" option. 
In a supply shock event, first seek to bring back supply.

It is after-all the *standard of living* that most people desire to be elevated, 
not inflation.

I guess the psychological order or preferences for public sentiment in a supply shock event are:

1. Get supply back first.
2. Failing supply getting back fast enough, limit demand (cause unemployment).
3. Failing limiting demand let the inflation run its course and support the real wage.

That's the dumb-dumb normie public. An MMT informed public would reverse 2 and 3. In 
fact option 2 would never occur. In a supply shock the very worst thing to do is 
cause more unemployment. You want *more* employment, not less. Workers make stuff. 
It's fascinating mainstream economists never seem to admit this to themselves, or out 
loud, but they *must* know it? 

In fact, under MMT analysis **_unemployment is never a policy option._** 


### What about bods for cahs withdrawal?

But ok, hiking interest rates does not directly cause unemployment, and is in fact a 
stimulus via trickle down effects, provided the government debt-to-GDP ratio is high 
enough. The question then is whether trickle-down is a good and fair way to smooth out 
a supply shock inflation era?

I would argue no, it is not.

Why do we want the people who already have savings to earn more, when the problem 
is a supply shortage?  It makes no sense.

"Rewarding savers" is one thing, but savers do not need rewarding, they are a 
curse --- in the macro. Paradox of Thrift. 

The public purpose is best served when currency circulates. So government has no 
purpose in rewarding savers. Savers know how to reward themselves, and that will 
always be in relative terms. There is no need on Earth for a government that issues 
Its own currency to incentivise more savers. Even in a supply shortage crisis.

But if governments have no clue and can see no other way, then issuing bonds to 
withdraw cash out of circulation is a viable option for smoothing the supply-shock 
inflation out over time.

However, there is a progressive way to do this: rather than issuing bonds, the 
government can give wage earners an income partially in bonds, so the savers are 
those who might not otherwise save. Basically the policy adopted in war time 
footings: war bonds, but in peace times it's just a social impact bond of a sort. 
This prevents the regressive trickle-down of indiscriminate bond issuance to only 
people who already have money (so who would not be restricted in purchasing power 
anyway). 

It is more trickle-up this progressive way. A low wage earner can choose later to 
sell their bond to get cash if needed, but can likely command more than the coupon 
price, or at least not much lower.
