Internet friend Derek McDaniel posted some 
[interesting stuff on Medium](https://derek7mc.medium.com/how-raising-rates-smooths-inflation-929bd37ae9e3) 
worth writing about. I'll use it as an entry into some wider issues of a 
continued massive need for MMT awareness. Right?... as if we don't all know 
this need! What am I doing here? Trying to activate activated activists?

## If "You" are the Government

... or a monopoly currency issuer, driving demand for your currency with 
coercive tax liabilities or similar means.

Given this, one way Derek points out for limiting inflation is to pull cash out 
of circulation by issuing bonds (Treasury securities). MMT helps simplify by 
noting a Tsy bond is simply a very secure savings account or term deposit 
(government guaranteed).

If you wish to get bogged down in legal niceties, hey, be my guest, but what I 
do is write from an MMT lens for the generic nation, so I am not considering 
the insanity of US Treasury needing a nominal positive balance in Its account 
at the FED to make legal payments --- with all the subsequent repo and reverse 
repo fidgeting.

We can instead assume Treasury and Central Bank are consolidated, so 
if the CB payments guys demand money from the Treasury gals, they can just use an 
over-draft. It's Left Pocket of government owing the Right Pocket of government.

This MMT consolidation followed by a latter apparent separation 
(left-pocket/right-pocket) is important because the records need to be kept 
track of, to prevent fraud, and to allow public oversight.

### Then You can do many things to limit inflation

The particular case I am going to imagine (only in my imagination) Derek was 
perhaps considering is when the inflation is being driven by a supply shock 
event, like a pandemic, or a war, famine, asteroid strike, hurricane, 
oligopoly price gouging, oil monopoly, fresh drinking water monopolist (who 
could that nest l√© be?), or whatever.

In this case a supply contraction means existing purchasing power (effective 
demand) is going to cause a market problem in *some* relative price adjustment 
upwards. If severe enough this can bleed into other sectors and cause a 
general increase in the price level, or at least blips in the CPI that become 
sustained and do not drop back down too fast.

Add to this the problem that when consumers get accustomed to higher prices, the 
firms tend to stay at the current level. Although no firms like losing out, 
they also do not want to lose customers. But if the consumer sentiment is for 
permanent upward price adjustment no firm will loose too many customers if 
they stay at the upwards adjusted price. Only a few firms tend t drop back 
down to previous prices when the supply shock ends. In this way price 
inflation is a bit of a ratchet. Mainstream economists call it "sticky prices" 
with is a dopey metaphor, bu it makes the same point, if you like some 
obscurity as a cost for getting fewer words.

### Why not invest to boost supply?

Why not indeed. This would be an MMT "preferred" option. 
In a supply shock event, first seek to bring back supply.

It is after-all the *standard of living* that most people desire to be elevated, 
not inflation.

I guess the psychological order or preferences for public sentiment in a 
supply shock event are:

1. Get supply back first.
2. Failing supply getting back fast enough, limit demand (cause unemployment).
3. Failing limiting demand let the inflation run its course and support the real wage.

That's the dumb-dumb normie public. An MMT informed public would reverse 2 and 
3. In fact option 2 would never occur. In a supply shock the very worst thing 
to do is cause more unemployment. You want *more* employment, not less. 
Workers make stuff. It's fascinating mainstream economists never seem to admit 
this to themselves, or out loud, but they *must* know it? 

In fact, under MMT analysis **_unemployment is never a policy option._** 


### What about bods for cahs withdrawal?

But ok, hiking interest rates does not directly cause unemployment, and is in 
fact a stimulus via trickle down effects, provided the government debt-to-GDP 
ratio is high enough. The question then is whether trickle-down is a good and 
fair way to smooth out a supply shock inflation era?

I would argue no, it is not.

Why do we want the people who already have savings to earn more, when the 
problem is a supply shortage?  It makes no sense.

"Rewarding savers" is one thing, but savers do not need rewarding, they 
are a curse --- in the macro. Paradox of Thrift. 

The public purpose is best served when currency circulates. So government has 
no purpose in rewarding savers. Savers know how to reward themselves, and that 
will always be in relative terms. There is no need on Earth for a government 
that issues Its own currency to incentivise more savers. Even in a supply 
shortage crisis.

But if governments have no clue and can see no other way, then issuing bonds 
to withdraw cash out of circulation is a viable option for smoothing the 
supply-shock inflation out over time.

However, there is a progressive way to do this: rather than issuing bonds, the 
government can give wage earners an income partially in bonds, so the savers are 
those who might not otherwise save. Basically the policy adopted in war time 
footings: war bonds, but in peace times it's just a social impact bond of a sort. 
This prevents the regressive trickle-down of indiscriminate bond issuance to only 
people who already have money (so who would not be restricted in purchasing power 
anyway). 

It is more trickle-up this progressive way. A low wage earner can choose 
later to sell their bond to get cash if needed, but can likely command more 
than the coupon price, or at least not much lower.

TODO: go over Derek's analysis, but for normies?

## Conclusion

All right. But at the end of the day why choose to force the central bank to 
smooth inflation in this fashion? There really is no need. It is simply one 
policy option, not the best.


```
Note for another day:
```
Had a few ideas about Minksy "Stability is destabilizing." MMT gives us insights 
into how to avoid instability, to have stability that is not unstable. 
Minksy was of course following Keynes. But we have to understand their assumptions. What drives euphoric behaviour? 

Ultimately it is greed, but "greed" can also be low level anxiety and simply 
a desire to "get ahead" under a competitive system. That, I think, is the real 
problem. If I am right then this points to some fairly clear solutions. 

1. Eliminate economic anxiety.
2. Eliminate needless speculation.

Those are at least key goals. Then the question is how? I think MMT gives us 
plenty of policy options. I can't even list them all, but I'll mention a few.

* Expand pensions. No one needs to be forced to save for retirement. 
* At the same time reduce all support for savers. Government does not need, 
and has no role, in incentivising saving. Let that be a private sector 
concern, with sensible regulations.
* Run currency inflation hot, but energy cool.  (q.v. Sam Levey.)
* Hot currency inflation can create anxiety or FOMO though, so the *way* to 
run inflation hot is to do it *only* at the base, target the real wage floor.
* Make such pro-inflation policy clear and transparent. Much like a Gesell 
currency, everyone should know what the upwards wage adjustment (only at the 
base) will be and when.
* Eliminate as much speculation as possible: allow trade only in real goods.
The last policy might be tricky. How to avoid people speculating on financial 
derivatives and whatnot without creating a black market.

I think in finance a black market here is a fair price to pay for outlawing pure 
speculative finance. It is a moral position. If you get caught you know the 
consequences. The question is only what policy can be easily enforce with limited 
fraud investigation and prosecution resources.

For the latter, maybe it is regrettable, but I think digital payments have to 
be on record for seller. Anonymity for buyers I think is sufficient public 
protection. Even in MMT circles people debate this, I favour a civil society 
that is non-anarchic, but also as liberal as we can make it without financial 
instability.

The stability of a financial system is a greater freedom from anxiety for all 
so is in many ways a gaol that is somewhat self-justified. This is always the 
way: by allowing one freedom we almost always necessarily curtail others. The 
question for a democracy is one of preferences for possible freedoms.

I think using the state currency is not a freedom that should come without 
reciprocal obligations when conducting commerce. But maybe that's just my 
taste. My taste is that I do not want government playing too heavy a hand, nor 
do I want so feeble a government that the public, especially lower income 
groups, suffer needless anxiety.

## Why other systems cannot prevent instability

Investors can also hedge their risk using various financial instruments like 
credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and so forth. But in a world governed 
by stock--flow consistent accounting rules these instrument cannot be 
guaranteed 100% safe. If agent B buys instruments to offload their risk some 
other agent C is no bearing the risk. 

Let's say *financial fragility* is broadly speaking any systemic risk of a 
credit crisis. 

The only way as a whole "The System" can avoid financial fragility is if credit 
and income grow in proportion to real output. The Keynes--Minsky euphoric 
psychology always gets ahead of the real output curve, or so history seems to 
tell us. Thus no amount of hedging risk can protect The System as a whole, it 
can only protect some but at the cost of exposing others. (Usually exposing 
those who can least afford it, or who have played no hand in creating the 
fragility in the fist place.)

So the problem is to get rid of the greed that fuels the euphoria.

I have always believed an economy based on morality, not markets, is the best 
framework for achieving the desired stability. Unfortunately this probably awaits 
a spiritual transformation of the human species in-the-large. Fortunately, 
whether nature's circumstances or ordinary decent working people push us 
there, I think the wait need not be too long. Because purely darwinistic 
"natural forces" cannot well regulate markets or policy, the choice of whether 
this stability and peaceful economics transform society within our lifetimes 
is indeed a choice humanity has available.
