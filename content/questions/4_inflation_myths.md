## Myths about Inflation and the Reality

Inflation is defined as *a continual increase in the general price level*.
It is imprecisely measured by indictors like the CPI (consumer price index, a weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale in the state currency units).


## Does Government Net Spending Cause Inflation?

If you think "yes," then you have succumbed to the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) myth. 

The *reality* is that never in all rcorded history has governemnt deficits cuased hyperinlfaitons.
The causlaity has alwyas been the reverse:

> The cause of all hyperinflations, everywhere, have been supply shock events, liek warr, war reparations, pestilence, drought or famine, and plagues.

The reason governments deficits increase during hyper-inflation events is because people find real goods in scarce supply, so people are competing for purchasing power, and government welfare payments have an inflationary bias in such cases. 
The government is forced, involuntarily, to issue more currency to the poor. 
This puts pressure on prices.

However, 
1. such inflation is indefinitely sustainable.
2. The fix to stop the inflation is to eliminate the source of the supply shock.

So the currency inflation is a natural event. 
The supply shock source is what needs to be corrected, not the monetary inflation.

Once supply chains and goods supplies are restored, the hyperinflation always stops dead. 

Remember, inflation is a continual increase in the price level. 
It is extremely hard for a government to keep inflation going, even if it wanted to, because if supply is good people don't just take money issued by their government and go out and eat more or travel more. 
There are physiological limits to what people can do!

Since the mid 1990's the Japanese government has desperately been trying to get inflation above 1%. they keep failing! 

Any MMT economist could show them how to get the inflation they want, but the point is that even government that want more inflation find it difficult toe get any. 
If you give people who already are eating enough and have shelter more money, they tend to save it, so in that case you cannot get any inflation by raising the government deficit. 

The way Japan could get the inflation they want would be to fully employ all Japanese workers, and give them decent living wages. 
that will make skilled workers scarce for private firms, which increases the wage bids. 
That will give Japan the inflation they want, and in a very healthy progressive manner.
