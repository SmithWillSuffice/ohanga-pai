## Myths about Inflation and the Reality

Inflation is defined as *a continual increase in the general price level*.
It is imprecisely measured by indicators like the CPI (consumer price index, a weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale in the state currency units).


### Does Government Net Spending Cause Inflation?

If you think "yes," then you have succumbed to the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) myth. 

The *reality* is that never in all recorded history have government deficits caused hyperinflations.
The causality has always been the reverse:

> The cause of all hyperinflations, everywhere, have been supply shock events, like war, war reparations, pestilence, drought or famine and plagues.

The reason government deficits increase during hyper-inflation events is because people find real goods in scarce supply, so people are competing for purchasing power, and government welfare payments have an inflationary bias in such cases. 
The government is forced, involuntarily, to issue more currency to the poor. 
This puts pressure on prices.
But the *cause* is the supply shock (cost-push), not the governments non-discretionary impact on demand-pull.
There is a good analysis about this direction of causation for the case of [Weimar Germany here.](https://gimms.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Weimar-Republic-Hyperinflation-through-a-Modern-Monetary-Theory-Lens.pdf)

However, 
1. such inflation is indefinitely sustainable.
2. The fix to stop the inflation is to eliminate the source of the supply shock.

So the currency inflation is a natural reaction event. 
The supply shock source is what needs to be corrected, not the monetary inflation.

Once supply chains and goods supplies are restored, the hyperinflation always stops dead. 

Remember, inflation is a continual increase in the price level. 
It is extremely hard for a government to keep inflation going, even if it wanted to, because if supply is good people don't just take money issued by their government and go out and eat more or travel more. 
There are physiological limits to what people can do!

Since the mid 1990's the Japanese government has desperately been trying to get [inflation in yen prices](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/inflation-cpi) above 2%. 
They keep failing! (Until COVID did it for them.)

Any MMT economist could show them how to get the inflation they want, but the point is that even governments that want more inflation find it difficult to get any. 
If you give people who already are eating enough and have shelter more money, they tend to save it, so in that case you cannot get any inflation *just* by raising the government deficit. 

The way Japan could get the inflation they want would be to fully employ all Japanese workers, and give them decent living wages. 
That will make skilled workers scarce for private firms, which increases the wage bids. 
That will give Japan the inflation they want, and in a very healthy progressive manner.

### A few pithy examples

In quantitative sciences it can be useful, for limited purposes, to consider extremes,
the extreme cases tell you what the asymptotics will be, so reveal tail ends of dynamics. 
You cannot use asymptotics for shorter run or highly constrained dynamics. 
But the inflation story is one where the asymptotics are good at revealing a few things about the relation between currency issue and prices.

Consider fruit prices and house prices.

If the central government handed me a million dollars next pay check --- 
which they can because they can just whip out the computer keyboard at the central bank and type in the numbers, authorized by a nice vote in Congress I bribed them for (extreme case remember) 
--- I would not be going out buying a million apples, I'd be buying avocados, but only a dozen, since my refrigerator can't keep more than that fresh for long. 

According to austeritricians like Mr Atif Mian](https://youtu.be/7obpebXeAlw?t=973) or any of the other New Keynesians and Neoclassicals, I'd be buying a thousand avocados probably, because I do not know how to manage my money, I need a neoliberal daddy to drip feed me. 
(Sure, see the sarcasm dripping off the page, but this is the extent of the neoliberal argument for austerity.)

If instead I go and buy a house I get one house. 
How is that real estate inflation pressure? It isn't. 
If *everyone* gets a free million and goes buying a house, then yep, house prices go up, but avocado prices don't. 
Relative value stories here.

We already mentioned the farmer and police officer story, that's another one to keep in mind, it's all about relative value. 

When a government issues a bucket-load (really a oil tanker load) of money suddenly the supermarket shelves go bare? 
I don't think so, households do not have the storage capacity.
Can other fictional commodities like purely financial assets like stocks and crypto boom in price? Sure, because nothing real backs them, but then it's all ponzi, so you go into those fictional commodity markets are your risk, not the general public risk. 
No amount of stocks issued by Google is going to collapse the environment.

### Stock prices

The price of a stock is supposed to reflect the real output capacity and sales of a firm. 
Most stock prices however are driven up by ponzi financing, so it's a gambling game --- who can hold out the longest before the stock price adjusts downwards to reality?

Warren Mosler had a great regulatory rule for eliminating this gambling game. 
Just limit all stock prices to \$2 per stock, and they can start at \$1 er share.
If a firm wants to raise more capital they can issue more stock.
This is after all the only public good use for a stock market. 
It is to gain investment capital for firms, it is not to generate fake income on a piece of paper for the investors.

Market forces are still then at play, since a firm will to find buyers of their stock if their firm is known to be in sales revenue trouble.

This is also the monopoly story all over again. 
The firm s the monopoly issuer of their IOU, their stocks. So they can either set the price or fix the quantity and let price float. 
The sensible option is to fix price and let quantity float.

The investors are protected when the gamble is eliminated. 
It is pure greed that stock prices are permitted to go up in price without limit based only on psychological ponzi mentality.


## What is the QTM Myth?

The QTM uses an macroeconomic identity:

$$ M V = Q P $$

On the left we have money supply $M$ and velocity of money $V$. 
Here $V$ is just the rate at which money circulates (sales per \$1 per year). 
You can take a single dollar and circulate it very fast, passing it from buyer to seller who becomes the next buyer, then to seller to buyer... rapidly enough that a single dollar bill can sustain an entire (small-ish) economic system. 
In practice people like to save on average 80% or thereabouts of their income, if they can, so to circulate money to drive commerce, a supply of currency that grows is more typical than making the velocity of circulation more rapid.

On the left-hand side of the above equation we have *quantity* of goods $Q$ and *price level* $P$. 
More exactly, $Q$ is the amount of output that gets sold each year. 
If the time period is a year, then $P$ is the average price level over the year (it does fluctuate).

It is an identity that $MV$ must equal $QP$. It follows from definitions of these four quantities.

The inflation myth is that by increasing money supply $M$ we will necessarily cause prices $P$ to rise, and that's inflation, if it is done continuously.

So lamestream economists tell you this myth that if governments run a continual deficit (injecting money *into* the economy, thus increasing $M$) then we will always get inflation, a continual rise in $P$.

This is bogus. 
You can immediately see why. Or at least I hope you can see why.  There are several reasons why this myth is false.

1. A fraction of $M$ can be leaked away in savings accounts, so increasing $M$ via government net spending does not cause increasing $P$. If these savings leakages increase over a time period then it directly lowers $V$, so might lower $P$.
2. Firms hate to raise their prices, they like customer loyalty, so they will always prefer to raise output $Q$ instead of raising prices $P$.

Firms only raise prices either, (a) when they find they cannot raise their output, or (b) when they have a monopoly, so have not competition, so can greedily just purely price gouge their customers.  A monopolist, as a rough psychological rule, does not care about customer loyalty. 
Customers have nowhere else to go. 
This is of course a major source of inflationary pressure, and is the dominant source of post COVID-19 inflation --- price gouging by monopolies, especially oil cartels.

People think food producers are also price gouging, but oil is the main input into food production, so not all food producers are price gouging, they are just passing through their energy usage costs to consumers. 
This is one big problem of unregulated capitalism. 
If left alone, firms pass off costs to consumers, and the poorest consumers are the ones who suffer the most. 
It is terribly unjust.

### Also, Q is Quantity _Sold_

Not all output produced by firms is sold, a lot is held as stock. 
So when either $M$ or $V$ goes up, prices $P$ can remain constant for a short time as firms deplete their stocks. 
Firms love to do this, since all stocks eventually depreciate. 
A firm keeps non-perishable goods in stock only while they think they can later sell them.
But while they are saving output to stock, this lowers the effective $Q$ in the QTM equation without effecting prices.


## Nominal versus Real Inflation

If and when government currency injections (aka. fiscal deficits) put pressure on prices, it is only because firms have maxed out their output capacity, so the firms are forced to raise their prices to suppress demand. 
(They'd be a bit stupid not to, and in any case it's a social psychology effect, they always do raise their prices if they cannot hire more labour or machinery.)

But what counts in all this, for economic justice, is not how much stuff \$1 can purchase.

> What always matters is how much stuff your whole income can purchase, not what just \$1 can purchase.

The decline in \$1 dollar's purchasing power is called **nominal inflation**. 
It is never a serious problem if the lowest real wage is rising faster.

The decline of your entire annual income purchasing power is called **real inflation**, and it is the serious problem.

Got it?

Nominal inflation shown by the CPI index and other metrics, is not a cause for concern.

What is of deep concern is whether your **_real wage_** is declining, not the number on your paycheck.

> *Nominal inflation* can go on forever until the end of time with no serious economic justice impact. **_Real inflation_** by contrast *cannot be sustained indefinitely*, it hurts the poorest the most through no fault of their own, and is unsustainable, if we do not want to see people dying in our streets.

Nominal inflation (CPI inflation) is only a psychological, hence political, problem, it is not an economic problem. 
**_Real inflation is the serious economic justice problem._**

It is possible to have nominal inflation and real deflation --- a decline in how much stuff \$1 can buy, but an increase in what your total wage can buy. In fact, this is the norm.
How? Because machine automation, hence unit worker productivity, pretty much historically always increases. 
(It's thanks to engineering inventiveness and science.)

The great social unrest from the COVID-19 pandemic inflation era is the decline in the *real wage*, not the nominal rise in prices.

Governments can do a lot to fix this, by adopting a Job Guarantee scheme, which boosts the lowest wage to a decent living real wage, by fiat --- government just says: "This is the Job Guarantee wage, take it or leave it." 
The Job Guarantee cannot cause any inflation because the private sector bid for unemployed labour is already zero.
At worst there is a one-time upwards adjustment in prices when the JG is introduced, if it is introduced at a wage rate higher than the existing unemployment benefit.


## Caveats

Telling the inflation story correctly is pretty important in social discourse. 
Too many people get it wrong, spreading misinformation and ignorance, and this can hurt our democracy and economic justice desires.

I would say the most important thing to learn about inflation is the stark difference between nominal and real inflation. 
If you understand the difference (which is not hard) you'll have a superior understanding than most people who rant hysterically about the "evils of inflation." 
Inflation is not evil, provided the lowest real wage is rising. 
And sometimes moderate inflation is necessary to keep the lowest real wage rising.

Why?

Full employment ensures the real wage is the highest possible, all other things being equal. Provided the full employment is in non-bullsh$\ast$t jobs. 
Full employment (in non-bullsh$\ast$t jobs) tends to imply moderate inflation, because there is always some residual job seeking friction. 
That's why inflation *per se* is not inherently evil.
