## Myths about Taxation and the Reality

The *reality*:

* Currency **_issuers_** do not, and cannot logically, use tax return for 
their spending.
* Currency **_users_** like you and I do not use tax return for our 
spending either, because we do not have legal authority to impose taxes in 
the first place.
* Special currency **_users_** like provincial or municipal governments) do 
not need tax receipts for their funding either,
* but local currency-using branches of governments that do not receive 
sufficient central government grant funds can be forced to impose taxes to 
get funds (numbers, scorepoints, in their bank accounts).

> The *myth* is that governments need to get their own currency off 
tax-payers before they can spend it! 
Think about this for a minute and you'll see why this myth is utter bonkers.

The reason local government should not be needing tax return is because 
they only need positive numbers in their bank accounts by law. 
The law can be changed to permit permanent overdrafts.
If the overdraft is at a private commercial bank that would be silly, the 
local government councils should just have overdraft facilities at the 
central bank.

Laws concerning such monetary relations between local and central government 
are pure conventions, the law can be changed to meet the needs of the people.

### Note on overdrafts

The Canadian government does allow banks an overdraft facility. They have 
partially recognized MMT, at least to the extent this implicitly acknowledges 
the CND is a scorekeeping system, not a pot of gold reserve or money reserve 
system. 

We in NZ ostensibly do not allow chartered banks to have overdrafts, but when 
the central bank (RBNZ) lends to a commercial bank, this is functionally 
the same as an overdraft. The interest is the penalty. There is no need for 
this however. Banks could be allowed permanent overdraft facilities at the 
RBNZ so that payments clearing software does not choke. There might still be 
a penalty interest charged, which would become the effective OCR. But at the 
same time eliminate a lot of pointless record keeping and lending operations.
Just use the spreadsheet at the RBNZ efficiently!

The issue at the end of an accounting period would be, "Is this back $Z$ 
running suspiciously high overdrafts?" Is so, then it is cause of oversight 
and regulators to inspect the books closely. Interview that bank's managers, 
and look for fraud (which possibly might be due to fraudulent customers). 

Regulatory investigation of fraud is, of course, a massive drain on 
human resources. There should be stiff penalties. But it does not "cost" 
the NZ government a single "tax payer dollar". The cost is always in real 
terms if you are the monopoly currency issuer, you pay the regulatory staff 
for spending time investigating the suspected fraud or accounting errors. 
That is income in their pockets, but the government would have paid that 
anyway (if they do not use a bonus salary system). 

The real cost is that those staffers no longer get to knock off work early, 
perhaps, so the golf course gets less income from fees. The putting greens 
go to seed. Although I joke, you get the idea. One purpose for strict 
regulation is that we have massive incentives against fraud, which lowers 
the real costs of regulation. Rule of Law is a more powerful and cheap thing 
when everyone obeys the Law.





### Why can't governments "logically" use tax receipts for spending?

By accounting logic **_no one can pay a dime in taxes until the government (or its licenced agents) first issue the currency._**

Remember, state currency is **_defined_** as *that which is accepted for payment of taxes, fees, fines and levies imposed by the state.*
State currency only comes from the government or its licenced banks, it cannot 
legally come from anywhere else. It is points on the central bank's scoreboard 
(secured spreadsheets, or in the $\mathfrak{olde}$ days ledger books kept 
under $\mathfrak{lock}$  and $key$.)

**Caveat:** In recent years, and going back in history, you can find isolated 
cases where governments have accepted stupid things for redemption of taxes, 
like bitcoins or gold. Since bitcoins and gold are of no use to a 
government$^\ast$ this is insane policy, but it has happened. It has a 
deflationary bias when gold is accepted (because the supply of gold is 
finite.) Every economist alive recognizes nominal inflation (privileges wage 
earners, real producers) is better to have than deflation (privileges the 
wealthy hoarders, rentiers).

$^\ast$ Gold is useful for electrical engineering, so governments can make 
some use of gold. But there are satisfactory metal alternatives in 
electronics, and what government, outside the former Soviet, is ever involved 
in running electronics manufacturing plants? OK, NASA in the USA used a lot 
of gold.  These days now the ESA and Chinese and Indian space industries too. 
That stuff does not belong under ground in Fort Knox. 

### Why do governments tax us then?

The purpose of taxation is to **_drive demand_** for the otherwise worthless 
currency, **_not_** to get supply of scorepoints for the monopoly issuer of 
the scorepoints!

Consider playing a game of rugby, or a game of cards, the scorekeeper does not 
need to get scorepoints off the players. The same holds for a fiat currency 
issuer. they are scorekeepers for the economy. The scorekeeping is real, not 
fictional, it is not "funny money", there are severe penalties for violating 
the scoring system. Try creating our own NZD scorepoints!

The scoreboard at a Rugby game cannot run out of points to award. 
For the same reason the government cannot ever run out of money, such a 
notion is utterly inapplicable for a country like New Zealand, which runs 
an MMT system.

There are three other purposes for taxation.  So four altogether as follows:
1. Tax liabilities (not tax receipts) drive demand for a fiat currency, without 
the tax liabilities no one would want to work to earn the currency.
2. Taxes on polluting production or harmful commerce help reduce those forms of 
production (the so-called Pigovian taxes).
3. Taxes can be used as redistributions, and to prevent egregious inherited class 
hierarchy. (Robin Hood taxation.)
4. Tax return withdraws aggregate demand, so helps cool off inflation.

None of the purposes are to "fund the government". They are *all* about 
balancing the *real economy*. 

"Funding the government" is an inapplicable notion. 
No currency issuing government needs to get money in order to spend it. 
Governments neither "have money" nor "do not have money". 
What governments have is a simple public monopoly on tax credit issuance and 
redemption. They issue state currency by typing numbers into bank accounts.

**Comment on 4.** Demand withdrawal is not technically necessary to cool off 
inflation. If people who hoard currency do not spend it, just save it, then 
there is no pressure on prices. In reality people often do spend their 
savings, eventually, and this can have a small pressure on prices, an 
inflation bias. But it is never a problem except when supply of goods are 
scarce, as in war time or a pandemic. In this case progressive tax rates (via 
bracket creep, or progressive energy usage taxes, or transaction taxes) will 
automatically cool off inflation in an economic boom.

(Note: most MMT experts would say transaction taxes and sales taxes are 
regressive and pointless. As are corporate taxes --- which are always a 
simple pass-through to the shareholders or customers, so also regressive. 
If the real idea is to limit energy use, then the tax should be on excess 
energy consumption, but starting at 0% for reasonable household energy use.)

((If we do not like what corporations are doing, we aught not tax them, since 
a tax is a legitimation. We need to fine them out of existence, period.
What about the poor newly unemployed? No problem: use a 
[Job Guarantee](/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/#money_story) 
policy.))


In a supply shock crisis the remedy for inflation is totally different, it is to 
*increase government investment* to fix supply. 
A gross way to do so would be to lower taxes. But direct functional targeted 
investments will fix the supply crises faster.

But in the former scenario the tax return is not in order for the government 
to get their own scorepoints, it is rather to withdraw scorepoints from the 
non-government sector which reduces claims on real goods produced by firms. 

The one-liner *reality* is:

> Taxation deletes currency from circulation.  It does not supply the 
government with currency.


### Why the fiscal constraints?

The *myth* here is that people think local governments cannot be trusted to 
spend wisely, hence need some sort of market discipline, which is imposed by 
private banks.

But this is ridiculous. 
Why are private banks any superior in knowing the needs of the local community? 

The proper regulation upon local state and municipality spending is an account of 
**_what resources_** the spending is procuring. 
If it is procuring yachts for wealthy people it is fraud. 
If it is procuring rent free housing for otherwise homeless people, or 
supplies for hospitals that are needed and which provide buffer stocks, not 
waste, then it is legitimate.

> When it comes to government spending there is no budget constraint, the proper 
constraint is **_real resource availability_** and suitability of the spending 
for public purpose, not special private interests.

This principle is one component of 
[functional finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_finance) or 
targetted spending.

A government, or demos really, that wants a thriving private sector, making 
sportswear, computers, smartphones, fast-food, games, art, or whatever, should 
be careful to not spend on purchasing the energy, hiring already employed 
workers, and buying up basic inputs that these private firms need. If 
government competes with the private sector the government will always win (if 
it wants to) since it is the issuer of the currency, it can pay any price. The 
demos had then better not vote for governments that suck up all the resources 
and starve the private sector. Generally the citizens do *not* vote for 
spend-thrift governments, so there is historically no known danger of 
governments spending wildly. 
It just never happens. 

Corruption of government institutions happens (as does corruption in private 
industry), but that's different to transparent votes in Parliaments for spending 
that voters can, or should, know about.

Functional finance is opposed to neoliberal ideas such as laissez faire policies. 
MMT recognizes that the public purpose cannot be protected through laissez faire 
policies, and that some component of government spending needs to be targeted. 
Government *should be* picking some winners and losers, not all of them, not even 
most, but just what is needed to fulfill the broadly democratically defined 
public purpose.

### Why the heck should government be picking winners and losers?

Most of the time government should not be picking winners and losers, as I 
already stated. But when the broad public purpose is threatened then government 
intervention is justified. The government does not get to define the public 
purpose in a semblance of a democracy, that is up to the demos.

Why should the demos then sometimes be using government to pick winners and 
losers? For a couple of reasons:
1. As the representatives of "the people" governments have a responsibility to 
ensure something nebulous called "the public good." They cannot do so with a 
laissez faire hands-off approach that lets powerful market players dominate 
the world of finance.
2. Private markets are not efficient, do not allocate resources fairly (they 
allocate according to who has the most money), and privilege people with power 
over workers who have to work to live. Bosses (of the rentier variety) do not 
have to work (much) to live.
3. In particular *the labour market is not a fair game*, a government is 
therefore necessary to protect labour. Workers have to work to eat, employers 
do not (do not have to work too much).

**Comment 3.** This means governments that protect interests of capital over 
labour are not legitimate governments. This is, of course, my opinion, it is 
not core MMT. Such opinions are part of Ōhanga Pai or Spiritual Economics, 
which goes beyond core MMT.

There is nothing wrong in protecting vital industries too. 
Both labour and industry can be protected.  The problem occurs when wages for 
labour are exploitative, and when business profits are hoarded by bosses and 
not shared equitably with workers. Only a government has the authority, legal 
power and enforcement agencies to protect the interests of labour. Trade 
unions used to have some power, but (a) never sufficient power, and (b) trade 
unions were never representative of *all workers,* so were not ever truly 
egalitarian.

Ōhanga Pai is not opposed to trade unions, but we recognize that individual trade 
associations and unions end up pitting workers against workers, and so are not 
ideal. Workers collectively need one union to represent all workers, that 
would be more ideal. Taking a limit, this One Unified Union of workers really 
*is the government*. No country yet has reached this ideal limit.


### Who decides what is in the public interest?

The demos. That's who. Not "the market." 
That's the only answer we've got that is remotely sensible from thousands of 
years of representative government. Or, if you like to say it this way, the 
demos really is a market, the egalitarian market of the voice of the people. 
One person, one vote. (Corporations are not persons.)

Governments can always spend as much currency as they like, it is their 
currency and it gets withdrawn later in tax returns or private savings. The 
issue is not how much currency is spent, but rather; 

1. is the spending fraudulent or legitimate?
2. Are real resources available? --- if not, the government should not spend on 
*those* resources, since that just puts pressure on prices.
3. If government absolutely has to spend on scarce resources for public good, 
it must free up those resources by either taxing or fining private users of 
those real resources. This is a political decision and political constraint, 
not a financial constraint. Currency issuers have *no* financial constraints 
that are not self-imposed.

The tricky thing here is that the reality about what should be the proper 
regulations on government spending are not recognized by politicians, nor 
by the news media, nor by the public or mainstream neoclassical economists, 
so the proper reality is not heeded. We instead get a terrible mix in 
reality: a confusion about what is possible, and what actually gets 
accomplished.

Due to unnecessary budget constraints (aka. austerity) government leaders 
are not doing what is possible to help their people. They are doing instead 
a bare minimum, which causes social unrest, and it is all needless. 
**_It is a tragedy of epic proportions_**.
Austerity about issuing currency is needless austerity.

When real resource limits are being approached then rationing and some other 
forms of conservation are necessary, but until such limits are reached there 
is no need for currency issuing austerity. 

In particular, human labour, all available willing workers, can always be fully 
employed, if not by the private sector, then in public sector programs to help 
out with local community needs. It is also anti-inflationary: the more support 
for businesses provided by government without, free of charge, the lower the 
costs of doing business, provided the government is not bidding up prices in 
hiring to provide the support. There is a natural (hard to define or compute) 
limit them to state support, but there is no financial limit. The limit is 
how much price inflation can be politically tolerated. That is a psychological 
limit, not a real nor monetary limit. A fiat currency on a float has no 
inflation limit, the inflation has no first order economic consequence, except 
that it is an inconvenience (firms have to keep checking the price level, which 
can be considered a bit of a waste of their effort, if instead prices could 
be stabilized). Although really, a stable positive rate of inflation is just 
as good, it is the uncertainty that is disruptive, not the inflation _per se._

With a fiat currency the inflation (continual change in the price level 
upwards) is a gauge. If other frictions are reduced, then this re-gauging 
should have no serious economic impact, provided it is a stable rate of 
change. In our times it **_is_** disruptive because our governments lack the 
understanding that their policy is the cause of all inflation (and 
unemployment). So they routinely make terrible banal policy mistakes. 
Mostly because they have the 
[Money Sequence](http://localhost:1818/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/#money_story) 
all backwards in their minds.

When public sector programs help out with local community needs, this is 
the concept of a two-fold increase in human prosperity:

1. Expanded public sector hiring, for public purpose (no bullsh*t jobs), and
2. a Job Guarantee wage floor --- which protects workers in the otherwise unfair 
labour market game, and simultaneously stabilizes the price level.

The Job Guarantee policy is necessary if there are involuntary unemployed 
workers who are willing to work but who refuse to work for the government. The 
government does not dictate what a JG worker chooses to do, but does pay their 
wage. In reciprocity, the government only says what a JG worker **_cannot_** 
do (light fires, bomb bridges, build "bridges to nowhere", steal from old 
grannies,  and whatnot).

((By "build bridges to nowhere" I mean of course anything wasteful of otherwise 
communal resources.))

## The Tragedy of Margaret Thatcher

Had Thatcher realized her government's money was sovereign, and was not 
coming from the "tax payer" then Neoliberalism UK style might have been 
a completely different story of full employment rentier economics. Still 
regressive, but at least not stuffing the working class so badly.

Even in your wildest dreams do you really think Thatcher was inherently 
an evil person?  I don't. She was just a very lazy incurious thinker hiding 
behind a bullying persona.


## Caveats

But doesn't issuing currency cause inflation? 
How can governments desiring price stability therefore have no budget constraint? 
Short answer is no: government spending does not cause inflation. 
Long answer is for [another chapter.](../006_inflation_myths)
