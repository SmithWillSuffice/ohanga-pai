This is one of the more contentious chapters. The MMT lens suggests the 
inflation rate **_is_* the interest rate, or at least a high enough 
interest rate will equal the inflation rate.
But not all MMT informed economists would agree, and that is pretty much only 
because the econometric data analysis is inconclusive. However, we are working 
on analysis to show the MMT base case is correct under most "normal" opening 
circumstances, which is that in normal times an upwards adjustment in the 
interest rate is inflationary, one-for-one. 

This occurs when the *own price* for the currency dominates the general price level. 
(The "*own price*" being the interest rate).

This is because the interest rate directly, one-to-one, raises forward prices, 
as well as provides the necessary free money to afford those prices (through interest income).

The nuance is that for people who are forced by circumstances to take out bank credit, 
this way of generating inflation is incredibly unjust and regressive. 
It feeds interest income to people who already have money, fueling the economy at the top, 
but crushes the poor who are reduced to buying food on credit cards.

The instability of high interest rates is thus more a social instability. 
The purely monetary nominal inflation cna e sustained for ever, but the debt burden 
faced by the poor cannot. 
They will either die or file for bankruptcy and thus incur all the downstream costs 
of having filed for bankruptcy (credit downgrades, lose of houses, and all that).

The fair discipline on a booming hot economy is thus not the interest rate 
upwards adjustment. The discipline has to be on real resource rationing and 
fine sand taxes on unnecessary pollution, waste, fraud and corruption. The latter 
methods of discipline hit the rich the harder, but never unfairly.


## Proving Interest Rates Hikes are Pro-Inflationary

We are working on this for the case of New Zealand. But for a few cases 
Richard Werner has already done some of the analysis. In his paper 
[Reconsidering Monetary Policy: An Empirical Examination of the Relationship Between Interest Rates and Nominal GDP Growth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521915001477)
Werner shows that for the UK, USA, Germany and Japan.

> In 6 out of 8 cases the hypothesis that "*low interest rates cause economic growth*" can be **_rejected._** 

This goes against the grain of about 95% of all economics analysis by the 
major schools of thought for over 200 years.
Yet it is fully in accord with the MMT lens. Hihg interest rates add to 
bank reserves whenever the government Treasury issue is above about 50% of GDP.
The reason? When government Treasury bill issue is above 50% of GDP the 
government is a huge net payer of interest, which prevailing tax return cannot drain.

Yes, it is highly regressive stimulus, and it is basic income but only for people 
who already have money, but it is a stimulus nonetheless.
MMT people do not advocate for this type of stimulus, and would prefer the 
central bank interest rate to be dropped to zero.

The way to stimulate an economy is to invest in productive fruitful jobs, 
and the government, as the monopoly currency issuer, can always do the minimum 
necessary by hiring all sustainable resources (especially labour) which the 
private sector is unwilling to hire.

This results in higher purchasing power in the pockets of labour, who spend most 
of their income, which drives sales for firms. That is the correct functionally 
targetted type of stimulus a failing economy needs, not higher interest rates.

Werner's results are more consistent with the story that central banks raise 
interest rates  always "too late," after a supply shock has already caused 
cost-push inflation. The recession is then already baked-in and the 
inflation pressure eases as lower income households get crushed. 
Then again, too late, the central bank takes their foot off the gas pedal and 
lowers the interest rate, which accelerates the recession.

It is all a bit perverse and backwards you see. There is no reason why the 
monetarist policies will work as advertised, and they never really do, and 
what is really driving the macroeconomic cycles is the government's automatically 
baked-in fiscal stabilizers (tax revenues and welfare spending).

The central bankers think they are doing the job, but they're not, 
and what they might be doing to counter the cycle at the credit margins is 
backwards, pro-cyclical, not counter-cyclical, and regressive 
(favouring the rich, hurting the poor). As Werner's data analysis shows, 
for the most part.


### Methodology

Initially we are going to redo Werner's analysis for New Zealand. 
Our conclusion will differ though, since Werner thinks central bankers dominate, 
whereas MMT analysis shows the fiscal authority is by far more dominant.

At ÅŒhanga Pai we favour stimulating an economic system from the base, 
from where real people are in desperate need for spending power, 
and not from the top where excess spending power already exists. 
So we would advocate zero interest rate policy, coupled with a Job Guarantee 
and targetted fiscal stimulus --- such as government direct investments 
(no "borrowing" your own IOU) in start-up worker cooperatives running 
sustainable production enterprises.

This advocacy sounds good to us, but to be credible we will need to show that 
the low interest rates are not a stimulus, and the high rates are a stimulus 
under certain conditions, but in a terrible socially unjust way.
We can do this by looking at how the lags and leads in the time series go, 
using Grange Causality tests, and if possible by looking at rate of change 
of household debt/credit by income levels, if the data has been published.
