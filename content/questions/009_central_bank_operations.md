Today I want to dig a little into the NZ versus the USA systems for central 
bank monetary operations. (RBNZ in New Zealand, the FED system in the USA.)

We use an MMT framework from the start, so we recognize from the beginning 
that post 1972 we no longer have a fixed exchange rate system for international 
settlements (that was Bretton-Woods). So the domestic policy interest 
rate _could be_ set at permanent zero without currency risk. Same in NZ since 
1985 when we moved to a floating exchange rate. 

With this basis in mind, we can begin to talk sensibly about central bank 
operations without the monetarist false framing. 

We also take the central banks to be branches of government, they are not 
"independent". The parliament/Congress grants the central bank committee 
discretion over monetary policy. But the central bank still take their 
marching order from Congress/Parliament, regardless of what any mainstream 
economics professors say (they tell a lot of fibs, perhaps not outright less 
since they do not know any better)


## The US System

On bank reserves and liquidity.

### Account Entries at the Fed

Bank reserves are just account entries at the Federal Reserve. In New Zealand 
these are called ESAS accounts (Exchange and Settlement Balance accounts).
These are not physical cash holdings but digital balances "maintained by 
commercial banks at their regional Federal Reserve Bank."

We need those quotes because who actually maintains these accounts? It is 
the central bank. The private chartered banks may send electronic 
instructions to the central bank when conducting payment clearing 
operations. But it is the central bank software that credits and debits 
those accounts. If a mistake is made either end then the accountants will 
damn well let the other end know, since one end's credit is the other's 
debit.

### Payments Clearing Operations

The primary purpose of these reserves is for payments clearing 
operations, not for maintaining liquidity in the traditional sense. Banks 
use these reserve accounts to settle transactions between each other and 
with the government.

### No Inherent Liquidity Risk

There is no inherent liquidity risk in this system. Banks can always make 
payment clearings as long as the Fed's systems are operational. The notion 
of banks "running out of reserves" for clearing purposes is an outdated 
anachronism in the modern monetary system.  In fact liquidity risk for 
bank reserves was never an applicable concept unless a central bank was 
(insanely) using a foreign currency.

### Interest Rate Management

The regulatory and statutory requirements around reserves primarily affect 
interest rates rather than liquidity. The Fed uses tools like Interest on 
Reserve Balances (IORB) to influence the federal funds rate and, by 
extension, broader market interest rates.

## Implications for Monetary Policy

This understanding has significant implications for how we view 
monetary policy:

1. **Liquidity Provision**: The Fed's role in "providing liquidity" is more 
about managing interest rates and financial stability than about ensuring 
banks have enough reserves for clearing.

2. **Reserve Requirements**: The elimination of reserve requirements in 
March 2020 was less about freeing up liquidity and more about simplifying 
monetary policy implementation.

3. **Quantitative Easing**: Large-scale asset purchases (QE) primarily 
affect long-term interest rates and financial conditions rather than 
directly addressing bank liquidity needs.

We should add that in the USA all bank deposits are 100% FDIC guaranteed
up to \$250K. But MMT experts will point out there is no good reason why 
100% **_full_** deposit insurance cannot be guaranteed. The ostensible mainstream 
concept is that customers can discipline their bank by going to another 
bank posing less deposit risk.  But no one, not even expert economists, know 
the actual risks, even the bank managers cannot say what their risks of 
default are. The MMT framing is that,

> The liabilities side is not the place for bank discipline. Banks can only 
be effectively disciplined on their asset side.

This means the loans and credit promissory notes the banks hold (their assets) 
are where regulatory and market discipline is effectively imposed. The hard 
lesson from banking history is that the liabilities side is not the place 
for market discipline on banks. Customers have absolutely no capacity to 
discipline their bank, except by pure guess work and a nose for the smell 
of fraud.

Do any bank customers make it an assiduous habit of sniffing for the stench
of fraud being emitted from their bank?


## Government's Role

An important point about the government's role:

- The only real risk to the payments system would come from government 
action that obstructs clearing operations, either through policy decisions 
or technical issues with the software systems.

This revised understanding (compared to mainstream knowledge and 
discourse) emphasizes the importance of the Central Bank's role in 
maintaining the payments infrastructure and managing interest rates, rather 
than providing liquidity in the traditional sense. It also highlights the 
fact that in a modern monetary system, the constraints on bank lending are 
capital requirements, profitability considerations, and the availability 
of creditworthy borrowers, not reserve availability for clearing purposes.

It's crucial for well informed policy decisions, and ultimately social 
equity, to have an accurate understanding of these fundamental aspects of 
the monetary system.
