This section is for discussions (in article form). 
Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy and fiscal versus monetary policy.
For public banking (really just banking in general) I've drawn heavily upon the prior work of [Warren Mosler](http://moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/), [Randall Wray](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/modern-monetary-theory-primer.html), and Eric Tymoigne. 

For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and [Bill Mitchell](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/), and [Pavlina Tcherneva](http://pavlina-tcherneva.net/job-guarantee-faq/).

For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon [Money on the Left](https://moneyontheleft.org/) and [Stephanie Kelton]([Stephanie Kelton](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/best-new-ideas-in-money/id1587222768)).

Contributors are welcome, but will need to submit through the [Contact](/contact/) form.
