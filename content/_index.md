Ōhanga Pai means "good economics" or "economic well-being" in [Te Reo Māori](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=ohanga) and yes, that means my focus is on the New Zealand economy. However, most of the software and educational material on this site is generally applicable to any country that has a currency issuing (not "currency using") government.

The [posts](/ohanga-pai/blog/) on this site give a blog journal style introduction to MMT (the Modern Money framework of analysis). 
My current focus is on macroeconomic simulations, mostly quick & dirty RAD with Python, but I will discuss a bit of social justice theory as well. 
If you want to get started, read the [Questions and Answers articles](/ohanga-pai/questions/) first.
If you want to instead dip into a bit of empirical work try the [Empirical section.](/ohanga-pai/empirical/)

Currently on this public website I've only posted the bare minimum to get a few of the ideas out into the ether. 
Sorry then for no software. 
Not much mathematics. 
All of that in good time I hope.

This is not just a software documentation project. 
It is a theory and philosophy project, so mostly educational.
