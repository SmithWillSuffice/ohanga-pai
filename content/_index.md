Ōhanga Pai means "good economics" or "economic well-being" in [Te Reo Māori](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=ohanga) and yes, that means my 
focus is on the New Zealand economy. However, most of the software and educational 
material on this site is generally applicable to any country that has a currency 
issuing (not "currency using") government.

The [posts](/ohanga-pai/blog/) on this site give a blog journal style introduction to 
MMT (the Modern Money framework of analysis). 
My current focus is on macroeconomic simulations, mostly quick & dirty RAD with Python, 
but I will discuss a bit of social justice theory as well. 
If you want to get started, read the [Questions and Answers articles](/ohanga-pai/questions/) first.
If you want to instead dip into a bit of empirical work try the [Empirical section.](/ohanga-pai/empirical/)

Sorry for no software yet. 
Not much mathematics. 
All of that in good time I hope. At some time I will stop writing the blog, it's a 
short-run thing to let off steam. I plan to retire properly (only be doing mathematics) 
at some stage in life, and that'll be when the blog becomes unimportant. I should still 
work on the empirical.

This is not just a software documentation project. 
It is a theory and philosophy project, so mostly educational.
