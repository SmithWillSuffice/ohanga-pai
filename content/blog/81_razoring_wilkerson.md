[Danny Haiphong ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKBY1UgILo)
often goes for interviewing the ex-military guys. I don't know why. But I guess
sometimes their geopolitical analysis is useful. They have the most 
horrific takes on macroeconomics though, complete idiots. They even get 
BRICS wrong. Don't they have an Rummy-Scholarship sponsored MMT submodule 
at Military College? ðŸ¤£

Government uses actual Uzi's to enforce tax liabilities in the military 
college version. (Don't dunk on Mosler guys, a metaphor can be funny and 
still class conscious at the same time.)

Jokes aside, I am not sure if this is serious or not, given the war machine 
geopolitics tends to over-shadow the monetary macroeconomics. But I dimly 
think it does matter.

So I try writing to Danny things like this:

> Around @10:00 somewhere... one bit of brain rot from Wilkerson (perhaps 
the only bit) is the "government debt."  He's got it completely backwards. 
So is here being a tool for the establishment.  The US government 
debt (accumulation of all historical deficit spending) is all outstanding 
cash, bonds and demand deposits. It is the non-government sector's net 
financial wealth. It is a GOOD thing it goes higher with a growing 
population, it supports purchases at existing prices (before inflation). 
It does not cause inflation (look at Japan!!!)   The massive problems will 
occur when the USA government goes into a surplus position â‡’ taxes back 
more us$ than it injects, which forces households into unsustainable bank 
debt (credit money).  But the real problem is the root cause of this, 
which is the desire to cause mass unemployment to force the working class 
into begging for sh1tty jobs.

... hoping some day he'll read on of my comments and take it to heart. It 
does you leftiepols no good if you refuse to accept the objective truth about 
monetary operations just because it conflicts with your anti-government 
stance which happens to agree with Margaret Thatcher, that great leftist 
of old, "It's tax payers money!" lol.

And sometimes I feel the obligation to follow-up:

> The problem with the US government debt held in the form of Treasury bonds 
is not the private wealth it represents, it is that it is highly regressive, 
since it amounts to nothing but  _basic income but *only for people who 
already have money* and in proportion to how much money they already have._ 
The US government have no need to issue bonds. Bonds do not finance the 
government, since no one can by a bond in the first place before the 
government issues the currency by deficit spending â€” which It can always do, 
since a fiat currency is â€” as far as government operations are concerned, 
not households â€”  nothing but government scorepoints (accounting units).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only purpose of bonds _other_ than 
basic income for the rich, is interest rate maintenance operations, but the 
natural rate of interest is ZERO (money at par). Trade imbalance is better 
handled with a floating exchange rate, not by interest rate adjustments 
(which are never clear in causal effects, owing to interest-usury and 
interest-income  having precisely opposite effects on the rich and the poor).

... as if I'm some sort of underground school teacher. Same as always. The 
students are never listening. They'll teach themselves when they are 
ready... I hope. But a good teacher can still plant a seed. Better teachers 
than myself, these days I find _if anyone not subscribed does read_ I only 
seem to be planting grenades which like hot potatoes just get thrown back.
