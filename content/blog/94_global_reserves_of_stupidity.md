We have enough reserves all right. 

[This piece from Mountain Tui](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/amateur-hour) 
was 99% good. Unfortunately the 1% that was bad was truly bad. I put it in 
the big basket of "Why the Left Always Lose".

The documentation of the ongoing far-right Clown Show, reflected by the 
ionosphere it seems down to the antipodes in 
Tory-led New Zealand, is all good, nothing wrong there. Only it stopped 
being clownish when people started dying because of the Show. It is more like 
a Michael Myers horror, but one of those Charlie Kaufman things where it 
becomes real life.  I still hope to wake up from the nightmare myself.... any 
minute now... any minute... oh for heavens sake!

## Bretton-Woods is Just a Town in New Hampshire Folks

Why the hell does this matter so much?  Read on McDufus.

I'm going to extract five consecutive paragraphs, perhaps the only bad 
things in Mountain Tui's post. But they are exceptionally bad. I have nothing 
against the author of course, pretty much everyone in mainstream discourse 
everyone thinks the same.  However, extraordinary fashy times call for 
extraordinary critical examination of mainstream political economy myths.

Why? Because the normie liberal (mis)comprehension of monetary systems is 
why we got to the fascist moment in the first place! No one seems to have 
learned from post-Wiemar history.

A lot of myths are false, and do us insidious  harm, insidious because the 
harm caused is often unseen and invisible (which is to say, the burden of 
the lowest of the lower class, which was not a burden made of their own 
volition).

Let's put under the microscope these seemingly very mainstream paragraph:

> _"\[The USA\] traditional status as the central currency of the world means 
that most economies follow its lead on interest rates, it’s able to borrow 
money at low rates and power its spending that has fueled growth, and it’s 
able to demand returns for every US$1 it prints for free._"

It is all wrong. No sovereign government (like little old New Zealand) 
needs to follow the US FED on interest rate policy. Why not? Because we do 
not need to u=issue NZD Treasuries in the first place. If we for some 
unknown reason had to issue NZD Treasuries and needed buyers to take them, 
swapping NZD cash for the bonds, then yeah, we'd have to at least match to 
interest rate (basic income only for rich people) offered by the US FED. 
But NZ does not need to issue Tsy bonds, so we have no tie to the FED rate. 
None at all. It is a huge lie and myth we do. Unfortunately the RBNZ 
believe this myth and lie.

Though, to be fair it is only a lie if you perpetuate the myth knowing it 
is false. But they are well-educated professionals, so _they have to know it is a lie,_ right? No???

In fact it is all the exact opposite of Mountain Tui's normie assessment. 
If under US FED rate hikes, if the RBNZ had permanent zero rate policy, we 
(the NZD) would be deflationary with respect to the USD. Since fiat (soft) 
currencies are only numeriares, all that means is the NZD would _appreciate_ 
on fx relative to the USD. 

But again, that is neither here nor there. So what if the NZD 
appreciates? If the NZ worker is getting paid less the US goods are just as 
out of reach on Amazon.com or wherever. (Yo, Kids! --- do _not_ purchase using 
Amazon. Use the producers own website.)

(See [Derek McDaniel‘s](https://ratedisparity.substack.com/p/if-two-countrys-currencies-offer) recent piece on this 
[here at “Rate Disparity”](https://ratedisparity.substack.com/p/if-two-countrys-currencies-offer).)
Believing the lie is true does not make it true. It just makes our central 
bank policy look like the myth is true. If you believe in fairies and unicorns 
it will look to observers like there are invisible fairies and unicorns 
floating around your head. 

Here is another bad take:

> _"Former French finance minister Valery Giscard d’Estaing once called the 
US’s position an “exorbitant privilege” because the US would never face a 
balance of payments crisis. Unlike other countries, their imports are 
purchased in their own currency."_

The Bretton-Woods Accord did for a few decades grant the US dollar a bit of 
a privilege. Theoretically. Until the gold ran out. But no one claimed the 
gold at Fort Knox, until the French had the idea they should try. Nixon went 
off Bretton-Woods tout sweet. 

Shows you how much of a farce the US Dollar global reserve currency idea 
really was.  All Smoke & Mirrors. Regrettably, once again, because people 
did not understand State currency operations, they all got suckered into 
believing the myth on a grand scale. It was truly shocking. The entire world 
fell for the veil of Bretton-Woods. The entire friggin' workd!  Just think 
about that! Like everyone just believed the Moon Landing by Armstrong et al 
was indeed a hoax. 

Even Keynes sort of gave in. He was perhaps too old to put up more of an 
intellectual fight.

And once again, if you think the image in the mirrors is real, your policy 
will make it look like it is real. Epic tragedy. Generations of unnecessarily 
unemployed workers. Wastes of human lives. I've _never_ said realpolitk is 
not a thing.


This is true: 

> _""Unsurprisingly Trump is destroying a century of unprecedented soft and hard power for the USA."_

that's part of the 999% good in Mountain Tui's very good article. It was in 
the paragraph sequence.

This is semi-bad:
> _"USAID, which Elon Musk & Trump dismantled, putting the most vulnerable people in the world at risk, and condemning many to die, wasn’t only about charity for America. It was about exerting influence, gaining power, and leverage."_

I hardly know what to say anymore. This is mindless. Yes, it is true 
USAID was mostly about gaining leverage for US soft imperialism. But no one had 
to buy the koolaid, no one was forced to drink it. No one had to die when 
USAID was starved and the US koolaid supply shut off.

You cannot blame the USA for the deaths here. The blame is entirely with 
the governments where those people died, needlessly.  Those governments have 
never lacked the currency capacity to solicit UN aid. They never needed US aid.

A foreign government does not need a foreign currency. It is as simple as 
that. What the poor countries need are real goods. Medicines. Clean water. 
Cooking equipment, local energy/electricity supply, all the rest. That does 
not have to be manufactured in the USA. But even less so does it need to 
be paid for with USA State tax credits. 

USAID was partly a CIA front, for soft coup promotion, but whatever good 
they did, it could be done by the United Nations. I know a few people 
at UNHCR. They are good people. A darn sight better than the USAID crowd. 
_They do not need the US tax credit for a single thing._ US residents need 
the US tax credit. Period. Been that way for all time.

If the UN purchases in a country $X$ they only need currency-$X$. 
Or do they?  In fact they do not. They only need _some_ currency. The 
Ethiopian birr would suffice.

Sure, the UN is funded predominantly by the USA, but not entirely. They 
can only run out of purchasing power if _all_ the other nations stop marking 
up the UN bank account in the "currency basket." 

I'd prefer the UN to start a parallel world currency myself --- the 
UN IOU --- but they'd have to sort out what it will redeem for. Presently 
I think it infeasible. It would require actual international unity of 
nations, what the UN should have been, not what it is at present. 
Collective security means securing the rights of the poor to a decent 
meal, clothing and shelter (plus oodles of free time and Internet... 
I'd say!), which means full employment with decent living wages, which means 
a UN claim on the output of every nation.  We cannot even contemplate this 
in a fascist rising moment in history.

By "wages" I mean fair compensation for public service. Good jobs. 
Not ᲇ⋓ǁǁ𝕤ꖲⅈ╬ jobs. Not wage slavery. Work in the form of crafts, arts 
and professions performed in the spirit of 
service to one's community. Wholesome stuff. The choice of the worker, 
within natural law of what defines "pubic purpose". 

It will have to be the slower road of each nation figuring MMT and a 
Job Guarantee out for themselves. But perhaps that is the better organic 
way, as depressingly slow as it feels from the vantage of a single human 
life span.

But heck man! Someone has to at least still carry the flame of working 
class emancipation. 

This is half-funny:

> _"Most Presidents were clued in enough to understand this."_

Clued-in enough to believe the myth the USD was a global reserve currency".
Mr Presidents of the world dudes!  Banks do not lend Reserves. 
Furrcryinoutloud! I know a high IQ is not a prerequisite for political 
office, nor should it ever be, but simple spiritual awareness is enough to 
get to an understanding of the source of all unemployment. You'd want to 
know if you have a single spiritual bone in your body.

This is half-funny:

> _"It’s hard to imagine how we could find a more stupid and amateurish clown show on the road."_"

Like I said at the start, it is no longer a mere clown show. It is professional 
state sponsored terrorism, mostly directed at their won domestic population.
