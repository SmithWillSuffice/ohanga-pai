Anyone enjoy the first season of [True Detective](http://www.hbo.com/true-detective)? 
The "true detectives" were very flawed people, but were driven by an unshakeable desire 
to see justice done --- on the catch the bad guy side it has to be said, not the raise 
up the poor side, but whatever. Griping entertainment with cinematic risk 
([Ã  la  Scorsese](https://www.filmstories.co.uk/news/martin-scorsese-on-why-content-will-never-be-cinema/)).

This post I'm going to have a crack at writing about similar risk in politics.

## What is True Populism?

You ought to read [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWKsTzHwIsM) if 
you're asking this question, but here's the short version.

True populism arose basically in Kansas in the 1890's It was a workign class 
movement, cross-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-class (but rooted in the working class 
--- upper crust people with a conscience --- or "class traitors" --- made up some of 
the composition). Their cause was broadly speaking economic justice. The farmers 
wanted a fair deal, the workers wanted fair wages, not to be ripped off and exploited 
because they needed to work for wages just to eat.

No right-winger has ever been a true populist. Daemonizing "the populist left" as 
like the conservative reactionary fake populists (Nixon, Buchanan, Trump, DeSantis, 
et al), is a terrible thing, and something Frank rightly rails bitterly against.

However, a lot of the grass roots support for these right-wing fake-populists comes 
from what would have been the Kansas roots --- the farmers, the blue collar workers, 
the genuine intellectuals who had real knowledge in action, not book-knowledge 
"Das Kapital" idiocy. Real knowledge --- *what it is like **to be** desperately poor*.
