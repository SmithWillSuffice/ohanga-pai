Anyone enjoy the first season of [True Detective](http://www.hbo.com/true-detective)? 
The "true detectives", Rust and Marty, were very flawed people, but were driven by an 
unshakeable desire to see justice done --- admittedly only on the "catch the bad guy" 
side it has to be said, not the "raise up the poor" side, but whatever. Griping entertainment with cinematic risk 
([à la  Scorsese](https://www.filmstories.co.uk/news/martin-scorsese-on-why-content-will-never-be-cinema/)).

This post I'm going to have a crack at writing about similar risk in politics.

## What is True Populism?

You ought to read [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWKsTzHwIsM) if 
you're asking this question, but here's the short version.

True populism arose basically in Kansas in the 1890's. It was a working class 
movement, cross-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-class (but rooted in the working class 
--- upper crust people with a conscience, or "class traitors", made up some of 
the composition). It rapidly spread across rural and small town USA. 

Their cause was broadly speaking economic justice. The farmers 
wanted a fair deal, the workers wanted fair wages, not to be ripped off and exploited 
because they needed to work for wages just to eat.

No right-winger has ever been a true populist. Demonizing "the populist left" as 
like the conservative reactionary fake populists (Nixon, Buchanan, Trump, DeSantis, 
et al), is a terrible thing, and something Frank rightly rails bitterly against.

However, a lot of the grass roots support for these right-wing fake-populists comes 
from what would have been the Kansas roots --- the farmers, the blue collar workers, 
the genuine intellectuals who had real knowledge in action, not book-knowledge 
"Das Kapital" idiocy. Real knowledge --- *what it is like **to be** desperately poor*.

By the way, old Karl Marx *had* such knowledge. Academic leftist pseudo-marxists do 
not. A lot of that type of marxist-socialist (the mere book-read nerd type) rightly 
abandoned Leninism (too violent), but then unrightly turned traitor and adopted 
neoconservatism or centrist neoliberalism (basically anti-communism, but not for 
good reasons).  Neoliberalism is no less violent than Stalinism or Leninism, just a 
different form of violence.

However, even some pseudo-Marxists who did not jump ship to neoliberlaism have still 
not understood populism. However, I won't sy old K.M. himself would've embraced 
populism, I don't know what he would've thought.

However, you can find Idiot Nerds writing against populism form the Marxist Ivory 
Tower [here](http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext28/Populism.html):

> Those of us who would change the world must first unlearn the dogmas of capitalism 
and construct new ways of thinking. Only when these ideas become sufficiently 
widespread (whether in the working class or a group defined on some other basis) can 
a challenge be mounted which could really threaten the dominant structures of the 
present society. Only then can we begin to consider the possibility of radical social 
transformation as an immediate political possibility.

"Those of us who would change the world..." oh my gawd! 

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for "raising class consciousness". But man, it's not 
rocket science. These sockcucking academic marxists have no clue. They're almost 
impediments to overthrowing neoliberalism (I know they do not mean to be, I don't 
hate these writers). 

You need a little humanity, some honesty, some humility, some balls, and a bit of a 
load of sh*t dumped on you by a boss. That can be turned into a potent revolutionary 
force brew. You don't need a whole new language or elite level comprehension my friends.
There are no dogmas of capitalism anyone needs to unlearn to know they're being abused.

Also, what the hell is "sufficiently widespread"? You do not know what that is 
until after the fact. But there's no point pissing around waiting for class 
consciousness to arise the way you say it should. It's not science. Scientific 
materialism, or whatever the hell you think modern Marxism is based upon is a pile 
of horseshyte. But by all means, try to mold something from it if you can, I'm not 
opposed to the effort.

A revolutionary force does not need an army of policy wonks. There are plenty 
who'll crawl out of the woodwork once the hard yakka has been done. Some might even 
be good MMT'ers, so you won't all get f*ked over by more austerity in the name of 
Neo-Marx.


### To Be Good Requires Populism

In political economy no pure ideology is going to take unless "the people" accept it. 
You are illegitimate if you force people at gun-point to accept a political regime.
(Literal or figurative gun-point, either.)

"Where is the gun of neoliberalism?" you might ask. This is the thing, the 
neoliberals have the most powerful gun imaginable, it is invisible. Figuratively 
speaking. In cold hard visible Parliamentary and Congressional vote records you can 
easily see the gun if you want to, it's the gun of artificial austerity --- depriving 
the workers of the means to fend for themselves in the class war by over-taxing them 
and under-spending on public utilities.

There is no other macroeconomics lens that shows the horror of neoliberal austerity 
more clearly than MMT. The horror is truly seen once it is realized how the 
monetary system works. It is only then you realize austerity is a tragic waste of 
human lives. It is a gun, not just by metaphor but by concrete material effect. You 
might as well just be done with workers you resent by gasing them or executing them 
in neolib firing squads.

Neoliberalism works much more smoothly than a Nazi. You do not have to have a 
gas chamber or noose around the neck of a worker if you tax them and then starve them.

Pure ideologies have a natural pull towards totalising the economy. 
"Our way or the highway." Populism is against such totalization. It listens to the 
voice of the people, and attempts to satisfy the many, while minimizing the costs 
to the few.

Is "listening to the voice of the people" itself a pure ideology? Not in my view, 
because that voice is highly heterogeneous. That voice contains contradictions, 
so is not pure. But that is why it is good.


### To Be Good Requires Risk

The once popular freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (or AOC) could have 
been a good populist. She had the right idea when she said once that there was no point 
to having a seat in Congress to fight injustice if she was not prepared to lose an 
election for speaking truth to power (or the like).

It is never too late for redemption, I say.

What about newly elected Representative John Fetterman? He's not a true populist 
yet because he still believes in the 
[“Tax-payer funded” myth](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/a-time-for-new-ideas/article/2020/3/18/gilbert-myth-of-taxpayer-money/).${}\dagger$ 
But he has potential to go that last yard. (It is tough for people elected out of 
local government office into central government, since in local government they were 
(still artificially mind you) operating in a regime that was financially constrained, 
in central government they are not, but many politicians cannot flip that switch.)

${}\dagger$Incidentally New Zealand academic [Jonathan Barrett](https://theconversation.com/government-funds-are-not-taxpayer-money-media-and-politicians-should-stop-confusing-the-two-153195) managed to write about 
the "tax payer funded " myth too, but still used atrocious language framing. He wrote 
as if the government has money "funds". There is no such thing. The NZ Parliament 
has votes in the chamber for spending appropriations (and a bunch of Select Committee 
public hearings for the public to have their say before the votes). There is no fund 
in the New Zealand government, except on a spreadsheet. 

If you are going to call a spreadsheet entry *you control* a "fund" you are some 
special type of sociopath. Legally the NZ government score-keeping is nothing like 
the legal liability of a private charity, savings & loan, or other house that has a 
fund in a bank account. Those bank accounts *are* funds, not because they are pots of 
gold, but because legally the holders are entitled to redemption from the banker. The 
government score-keeping is under no such liability. Only the NZ Crown has the legal 
right to issue the NZD by fiat. Banks have no such right.

The NZ government neither has money nor does not have money. We have a pure MMT 
system. It is a simple public monopoly and score-keeping system. It is good, popular 
and fit for purpose, if only the politicians knew that purpose and held to it 
(collectively they do not).

Rep. John Yarmuth (Kentucky) made the journey to MMT eventually, then retired. A pity. 
But as a private citizen he now also has a chance to redeem for past misguided 
allegiance to neoliberal centrism. I wonder what will become of him? It is never too 
late for an established insider, now an outsider, to risk facing the guns of neoliberalism. Take a few on the chin or in the guts for the working class.

Yeah, yeah, call me out for volunteering someone else for the firing squad. But you 
don't know me. I'd take a gut full of bullets for all the workers of the world if 
they could be free of their bosses and still productive and creating the goods for 
each other. The perennial problem is utter obscurity, I can't seem to take any 
bullets since no one is aiming at me. I'm a true populist but don't have the holes 
in my guts to prove it.
