Today I will (after a brief prelude) defend the thesis that inflation --- if 
well-designed --- is a progressive policy tool that benefits the most 
disadvantaged. So the MMT Base Case _probably_ should include deliberate 
designed inflation, of some character. The character I will defend however, 
is not going to be inflation, it will be one-time re-gauging of the 
currency --- which we take to be the State's unit of account. 

It is only "inflation" if you take a long run continuous interpolation. 
To be clear, in MMT circles, _inflation_ is _defined_ as a _continual_ 
increase in the price level **faced by consumers today**.

* **Not** a rise in come commodity prices, and not price gouging.
* **Not** a rise in the wage rate.
* **Not** not the CPI (which is looking in the past, not today).

The last battle of MMT will be when people running the government (and let's 
be generous, and say of whatever political stripe) _all_ of: 
(a) understand MMT, (b) knows everyone _else_ knows _they_ understand 
MMT, (c) everyone knows the monetary system is best described in 
operational terms by MMT.
And the last skirmish in this battle, as I see things, is to forever 
vamoose the inflation bogeyman to the fictional children's closet it 
comes from.

But it is clear to my eyes that liberal--progressives stand in the way. 
They may have dimly perceived the government debt is not a problem. But 
the standard arguments against expanded social services is always the 
back-up monster of the inflation bogeyman. 

I come up against it all the time. I do not have the educational 
superpowers yet to send it into the Phantom Zone, or better yet, down 
a proverbial Black Hole of gravitationally crushed stupid 
economics.${}^\ast$

${}^\ast$This is a bit of a physics joke, if you know my stance 
on black-holes! Black Holes could be mirrors, so emit the same information 
that hits them, foiling my plans to sink ê•·ê–¾ê•¯ê–¡ê–¡ê”‡ economic thought down 
the gravity well.















This does not mean MMT is a Lens on merely the scorekeeping system. I 
take my definition of MMT as:

> _An understanding the monetary system is a simple public monopoly and 
all the consequences thereof._

If the government is not a monopoly currency issuer then the analysis will 
not be as simple as the MMT Lens. But today, most nations do operate an 
MMT system. Private banks and firms cannot create net State tax credits, 
whatever other financial instruments the state allows them to use. 
Don't blame us MMT'ers for all the government backwards policy 
responses to events. all the policy makers are in active denial of MMT.

Today I wish to emphasize that the becoming of items (a), (b) and (c) above 
will imply the easy elimination of the fear-of-the-debt and the fear of the 
inflation bogeyman.  Both are due to false psychology.
It is increasingly clear to me that a major obstacles stands in the 
way of MMT education. It is not the Deficit Myth, it is the 
Inflation Bogeyman. even moderate liberals and headline MMT people promote 
this fear. The headline MMT'ers perhaps only passively. But this includes 
the otherwise excellent Randall Wray, and the MMT educator 
Supreme Stephanie Kelton. 

They parrot the old tired pablum that inflation is a real constraint.

Well, no it isn't.

I am going to defend my position, of course for educational purposes, 
so "take it for leave it". Your problem if you decide not to learn.
My position is that inflation --- but "deflating"ðŸ¤£ the meaning to 
**one-time currency re-gauging**, so not technically 
inflation _per se_ --- is a darn good thing.

## Parry 1

Firs thing to be clear on is that one-time regauging the currency unit 
downwards (1) reduces the purchasing power of hoarded wealth (a good thing) 
and (2) reduces the burden of past debt (a good thing). Here "good" is 
relative to present political economy class relations, which I wish did 
not exist, but I'm analysing what system we have, for now, not some 
socialist or anarcho-syndicalist utopia.

OK, but I cannot say one-time depreciation is going to have these nice 
outcomes. The policy implementation matters, because of the dynamical 
effects of hysteresis.







## Parry 2

Any government that has decent social policy and the love of their people 
can sustain inflation on to infinity. It's a book-keeping nuisance of 
course, to have firms constantly re-gauging prices. But if the democracy can 
withstand, then high inflation rates are sustainable in perpetuity. 
The nuisance factor means I do not support pro-inflation policy. However, 
I would support the next best things, either:
1. A Gesell currency --- erodes the purchasing power of the government 
scorepoints by clear transparent policy design.
2. Currency re-gauging by increasing the lowest wage, but that is all.

The former is essentially currency devaluation, but keeping market prices 
basically quasi-stable.  Prices change when the economy changes, when some 
goods become expensive due to supply constraints, while others are due 
to newfound automation and other efficiencies.

Recently Derek McDaniel wrote a nice review of a third policy, the 
negative interest rate. Which is a modern way to run a type of 
Gesell currency. It is effectively equivalent to a tax on holding not 
money (government scorepoints). But I see the negative interest rate 
as a pedagogical talking point, a toy model, not a good policy.  Why?

Because I think there _could_ be huge nasty unintended consequences, like 
pirating and hoarding of _other_ resources, and nasty rent seeking and 
nasty competition, which should be avoided, since it is pointless, it's the 
same sort of stuff you get when adopting a gold standard, currency peg, or 
fixed exchange rate, but especially a gold standard --- people wasting 
their labour figurately 'digging an almost useless metal up out of the 
ground' all just because the government promises to redeem taxes for the 
stupid metal. (Hey, at least Austrian School nerds do not advocate a water 
or air standard --- but you just imagine a monopoly issuer of air and water! 
In some countries we nearly have such entities, which is a clear case in 
favour of a workers League of Assassins: exterminate the NestlÃ© water 
fascists.)

For the same reason I'd be a bit wary of a Gesell currency. I prefer 
stability when possible. So just stick to ZIRP and a decent Job Guarantee 
automatic stabilizer. It is wholesome goodness. Heterodox economists of 
all people aught to be very wary of unintended consequences.  This is the 
sort of concern promotion I like, the sort based upon known unknowns... or 
something like this (getting your head around the right quadrant of 
Rumsfeld space you are in can be a headache at 4am in the morning 
writing a blog)
