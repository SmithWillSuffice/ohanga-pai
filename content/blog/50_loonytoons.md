LoonyToon time again in Aotearoa New Zealand. Unlike Dr Bill Mitchell, I 
can afford to be short and sweet.

The New Zealand Tory government (National + ACT party) have macroeconomics 
completely backwards. Not just roughly. Completely. The "finance" Minister 
Nicola Willis went on official record the other day in proclaiming the NZ 
Government is like a household. Or, the Government Budget is Like a 
Household Budget". 

Every MMT'er around knows this is utterly insane, and even a few post-Keynesian 
dimly know. I did my best on non-X social media to denounce Willis. But I'll do 
it again. However, because post-Keynesians are contributing to the myths, still, 
we have to focus on them, because they should know better. So should heterodox 
folks like Brian Romanchuk (he's a bit suss on these issues, I will try to 
explain in a minute').

And it is not that the previous Labour government was much better, their 
leader Chris Hipkins was saying the same as Willis in different words. But 
class warfare is class warfare no matter whose mouth sounds the sweetest 
austerity.



## The Proper Hammer

I loath Nitzsche. (Heck, he did have syphilis and was insane. In the real 
world a person's character counts for something, not just their analytical 
concepts. If someone has a poor character you trust less their ideals. 
Sorry theorypleeb and you other Lacanians. That's just reality.) 

I also do not like Vladimir Lenin. You can cry to me as loud as you like 
about how masterful he was as an organizer, but without a mass of ordinary 
peasant people and bourgeoisie supporters, who believed in a decent vision for 
Russia, he was nothing. If you truly think Lenin was a great man, you are 
closer to being an Ayn Rand acolyte than a working class populist. That 
includes you China Mieville. 

But using thought and education as a hammer against the spiky sticking out 
loose iron nails of ignorance is based. I am a peaceful person, so I prefer 
to hammer bad ideas, not people. Class warfare is war against an entire 
class of people who are providing all goods to maintain the lifestyles of 
the rich. Although really the wealthy disgust me so much (why not give away 
all your excess? It is after-all... excess) that I just do not even want to 
know them to have to avoid hammering them for real.

"Ahhh," but you say, "the realpolitik means we cannot avoid mixing with the 
rich and powerful, because they hold reigns of power, so if we are to win 
the class war we need a few of them on our side."

That is an argument.

But the reality is no number of rich people will win the class war. The 
class war is won when the majority rise up united against neoliberalism and 
fascism. For the leftiepol nerds, let me define "neoliberalism" for you so 
you do not misunderstand: it is the entire liberal elite who do little real 
work and yet claim the majority of currency scorepoints.

You won't find that definition elsewhere, it is parochial for here at 
Ohanga Pai.

Note that a democratic majority power of the people cannot be exclusionary 
and ideological, it must embrace all people, even a few libertarian retards.
(we could probably do with a quota on them.) I like the sound of a 
dictatorship of the proletariat, but it rings too strongly of violence and 
intolerance, even though "the proletariat" would be such a diverse crowd! 
It would have to include a few rich people too. Status as a proletarian 
does not imply one is not wealthy.

Ah, crap. I guess I'm going to go longer than Bill Mitchell today.
