Lunchtime listening this week, Brian Greene chatting with Adam Reiss on 
cosmology. 

## Hubble Telescope is in the Public Commons

At one point Riess mentions he decided to not rest on his laurels, and went 
back into research "using the Hubble telescope."

I could not resist the urge to post a yt comment boosting MMT.

> @55:00 as a macroeconomics justice advocate I have to boost this: Riess 
using the Hubble telescope. It's a public resource, in the public commons. 
That's the way to accelerate science, not commercialize and privatize. Point 
being, it is *_not_* tax-payer funded. It's the other way around. When 
government spends it issues the currency by fiat (to NASA employees etc), that 
provides the funds for _everyone else_ to pay their tax liabilities. I call it 
Modern${}^\ast$ Money Mechanics MMM (modern-money-mechanics, the framework I 
formerly know as MMT).  If governments impose tax liabilities but then do not 
spend, no one can pay taxes without going into bank debt. Government spending 
fuels the monetary economy, not the "tax payer".

I continued:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tax payer funded" is a giant myth and a 
tragic one of epic proportions, the reason for so much needless neolib 
austerity policy.  Read more 
[here: ](https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/) 
for some MMM/MMT basics, you'll understand more about public finance than 
an econ PhD.   


## Take Any Opportunity to Boost MMT

With such humility being displayed, I continued,...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens fund the government in *_real 
terms_* not monetary terms --- exchanging goods or labour to the government in 
return for tax credits (aka. USD, yen, UKP, euro, peso, etc.). Tax liabilities 
imposed drive demand for the otherwise worthless currency, the tax return does 
not supply the government _ab initio_ with their own currency, it had to be 
issued first by Treasury/CB or a chartered licensed bank as a credit to be 
redeemed with interest (licensed by the state, so an agent of the state, even 
if privately owned).

I went on...   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${}^\ast$ "Modern" here is an inside joke 
--- it means going back 6000 years to the first records of money of account 
i.e., cuneiform records in clay tablets of credits and debits. So MMM/MMT is 
"modern" in geological time scale terms.


That was all.

The cosmology is something I blog about more on 
[T4GU](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/).
