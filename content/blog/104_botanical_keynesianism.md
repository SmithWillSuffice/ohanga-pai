## Forest & Bird Keynesianism 

This is a reminder-to-self to write a substack article on the superior form 
of Keyneisianism. If someone cannot find work, last-resort is to grow stuff 
in a local garden, or restore a forest habitat, seed-by-seed. The reserve 
army of gardeners. I'm only half joking. 

Just you imagine all those college students wanting a scholarship and a 
job guarantee but their mean & nasty authoritarian government will only 
guarantee enlisting them in the gardening and forestry Corp.
🧐 👴🏼 "HellNo! World Peace might break out like a nasty rash! We absolutely 
can't have that dear Jeeves!" 🤣

I am also going to write this under a second title...

## Money is not Capitalism it is Socialism

🔥 Hot MMT take today, but it is 110% true. I sampled the Multiverse and 
got more branches where this statement is true than branches. 

**Why?** 

Because...
> _MMT is nothing more than the recognition the monetary system is a simple public monopoly **and all the consequences thereof**._

Almost all nations today run an MMT system (whether the government people 
know it or not, mostly they do not).

... _and_, whatever else you say it is, a public monopoly is Socialist. 


All the macroeconomic injustice is due to the people in power not 
understanding this, and running government as if they are beholden to the 
wealthy capitalists. They re not. But believing they are leads to crazy 
policy responses, even _backwards_ responses (from an MMT lens at least, 
where decent minimum wages and full employment is the goal, and an easily
achievable goal, since it is just a policy choice.)

Why do even soi dissant progressive normies drink right-wing economics 
koolaid ("The government is bankrupt since the debt cannot be repaid! 
We'll have hyperinflation if they spend a dime more!")

Well, we have people in government running this overtly socialist 
subsystem (the monetary system) who really do not want to be thought of 
as socialists. It's a dirty word to them. Hence all our troubles.
They're playing cricket but using the rules of rugby. 
They're drilling holes in the boat to let more water out.

At this stage, we even get socialists in government who probably desire 
to be socialists witlessly running the right-wing policy for us, with the 
socialist MMT money system human civilization has had in place for over 
6000 years. Yep. All that time, the kings and emperors had this little 
element of socialism at the core of their dominions. They were the currency monopolist. It did not become an _actual_ little element of socialism 
until "the people" got the vote.  It will not ever be a full-on socialist 
subsystem _proper_ though, until _The People_ get the vote for who 
to vote for in the first place.

Why the obstacles then to learning MMT?

I want to say it boils down to one thing:

> The power elites need you in a low wage condition, because then they 
can control you.

The power elites (unfortunately also most of the cretins running our 
government) do not even really want a thriving middle class. Their interest 
is in moving you out of the middle class into the precariat, so they can 
appease you with a UBI and a Debt Jubilee, like the ꗇꕷꕷ𖦙𖥕ꛚ𖠢 king and 
emperors of old.
