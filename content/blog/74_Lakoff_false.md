## Money Frames

Had a reason to review Lakoff and language framing. It was interesting 
(and ironic gioven his politicla preferences) how Lakoff is so ignorant 
of state monetary operations that he regularly false frames taxation and 
welfare issues. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9R9MtkpqM) is the 
[lecture for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9R9MtkpqM).

It's a brilliant little lecture, but I had to post a long comment.

> Lakoff himself is guilty of false framing. Regarding "big government" 
and taxation, etc., he fails to realize all US dollars come from the 
government or via credit from the chartered agents of the State (licenced 
private banks --- they are part of government) the US﹩ does not come from 
anywhere else (it'd be counterfeit). So tax return is a "return back to the 
issuer", from the French, revenir. It is not a funding operation for the 
government, it is a redemption (the US﹩ is an I.O.U,. of the State: "I owe 
you redemption for one unit of imposed tax liability.").   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So "my tax dollars" are not funding 
anything. They came from government from inception. The government issued 
that currency by spending (or a bank issued credit in circulation, but that 
is not net US﹩ creation, since there is a debt on the other side of the 
ledger). All the dollars spent by the government not yet used to pay taxes 
are the non-government sector's net financial wealth in US﹩.  The false frame 
is to call that "our debt". It is in fact our ﹩ wealth. The debt on the other 
side of the ledger is that the USGov promises to accept back Its currency 
when you pay taxes. If it refuses to redeem your tax liabilities it is in 
default and has not honoured Its debt. The US Gov is at least acting "morally" 
because it never seems to refuse to redeem, it always accepts your tax payment.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral obligation is more serious 
though: by imposing taxes in currency no one initial has, the government 
creates unemployment (people seeking to earn the tax credit). The government 
must then spend sufficient to permit the "economy" to pay all the imposed tax, 
plus meet savings desires, otherwise it made a terrible policy blunder and 
caused residual employment, a simple policy mistake, not a market force.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are net savers around (they need 
not be billionaires, anyone who nets saves is forcing someone else to net 
spend) then the government should be running a deficit (spending more than 
tax return) otherwise the government is by local accounting identity placing 
some people somewhere in needless debt to a private bank.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, some conservatives 
understood this. In a very twisted way.  The folks working for Reagan and 
Bush knew government deficits were necessary, since by accounting identity 
the government deficit is the private sector surplus  --- while simultaneously 
"blaming" Democrats for the government deficits! Orwellian in the extreme! --- 
they just wanted most of the surplus to go to the Top One Percent, not the 
poor via hiring all the unemployed the tax liabilities created.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan was right (though still racist) 
to not want "welfare Queens", but he was disingenuous, he could have made 
them all go away by hiring them all for public service in decent meaningful 
jobs. There is no end to work needing done, we wake up every day to severe 
labour shortages, but the private sector will not hire the unemployed, they 
do not want them, they want people already working, so a demand stimulus 
will usually just cause a wage demand spiral, leaving people still unemployed 
and wasted. Only the monopoly currency issuer can hire all the unemployed 
without causing inflation, since the private sector bid for the unemployed 
labour is zero.  (Not that moderate inflation is bad mind you, it is a good 
thing if the real wage is rising. A bit of inflation erodes the purchasing 
power of hoarded tax credits.)


## Love Sets

From _Metaphors We Live By_ there is this idea we use spatio-temporal 
adjectives and metaphors to describe distinctly non-spatio-temporal 
concepts.
* Mary is imprisoned in her marriage.
* Maya is in cahoots with Martin. 

et cetera. All fine and good. But what Lakoff & Johnson too casually dismiss, 
to their detriment, is that "space" and "time", while objective elements of 
reality imho, are nevertheless _mental constructs_ we use to make sense of 
patterns presented to our mind.

For the former (the elements of reality) we could tell this if we 
supposed animals were non-conscious Zombies. (Maybe some are! Who the hell 
knows.)

Which is more important then, the idea of a _space_ or the more abstract 
notion of membership (of a set or class)?  I'd argue membership is perhaps 
the more primitive. Just a musing. 

So "being in love" is membership of the set of people in the state of 
adoration of their beloved.

So what of spacetime and other proper spaces with measures? Well, is it not 
a prejudice to say those spaces have measures, and the set 
**<font style="color: hotpink">Love</font>** does 
not? Counting things in a set is a measure. 

Alright then, so what is so proper and special about a manifold or a 
spacetime? What is so special is that we _live_ in one of them! 
Objects embedded in spacetime share all the symmetries and laws thereby 
associated, which unites us as a One. (What?... too commie??)

We are not all fortunate enough to be in the set 
**<font style="color: hotpink">Love</font>** and we are all, for now, 
stuck in the set **<font style="color: dodgerblue">Spacetime</font>**.
A huge aspect of the struggle of human civilization (and I presume the 
Trisolarians too) is to survive in this particular matrix and find peace 
and harmony while doing so, it is any civilizations calling. 

Those who think life is all about conflict and competition have it 
all backwards. Those effects seen in natural evolution are the 
pathologies that are the norm, precisely because the spiritual is too 
often ignored. (Lakoff & Johnson guilty here.)

The better way to think about language is that all the physical/material 
concepts are the metaphors, and they spring from the spiritual, not the 
other way around.  (This is why no respectable neoliberal politicians want 
to be near my thought cloud proximity.)
