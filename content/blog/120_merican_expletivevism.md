Having caught up with Aaron Good's 
_American Exception_ and _Devil’s Chess Club_ podcasts (free tier) I have some 
things to say in mild critique. I do not challenge Aaron any anything essential
_to his main thesis_, but there are some essential things needing critique. 
And I think my critique should boost his thesis. I'd wager he'd think not, 
but he'd wager badly 🤣!  Anyway, he's the PolSci expert, so I've probably 
got my work cut out for me today. Let's see if I can manage it.

The only serious issue is that Aaron is highly ironically suffering from a 
case of US dollar Exceptionalism himself, so he perpetuates right-wing 
macroeconomic myths. Which ones? Here's a shortlist:

* (Reich-wing Myth): The US dollar was a "global reserve currency."  --- False, 
since redemption for USD was a _voluntary arrangement_, a completely 
unnecessary one when the alternative was a floating exchange rate.
* (Reich-wing Myth): Deindustrialization was bad. ---  False. It was good, but 
the USA failed to reap the potentially massive benefits, except for the 
parasitic top Ten Percenters.  We do not want the war machine to get 
reindustrialized. We do not wnat our children to go back to factory work, 
thank you very much.${}^\ddagger$
* (Reich-wing Myth): Inflation bad. --- False, inflation is good (de factor 
inescapeable tax on hoarded currency), but it matters 
_how_ it is generated. How it has been generated is horrifically bad --- via 
government bond interest rate maintenance = basic income but only for people 
who already have money and in proportion to how much money they already have._ 
* (DumbDumb-leftwing Myth): We need more welfare. --- False. Or fasle-ish 
let's say. We do not need more welfare. What we need is more well-fare. We 
need more people getting compensated (that's an evil thing called a "wage"🤣) 
for helping other people.
* (Reich-wing Myth): Tax payers are funding the wars. --- False. No tax payer 
is involved, if they were it would be counterfeit.

${}^\ddagger$Not sure who the "we" is here, but I think we've got a few of 
us! Bit of nationalism in there which needs modulating later. Thing is, the 
"we" should include the Chinese and Vietnamese as well, who should not want 
to continue being the rest of the worlds factory workers. The Chinese (or 
some of them) have recognized this, I think, which is why they are wisely 
also moving much of their production "off shore". But they are the smarter 
deindustrialists! This proves my point.

Spare me the nuance scoldings, I know them all. I'm just short on keystrokes, ok.

I'm sure Aaron would not want to think he does. But he's 
an honest guy, like he'll admit H.W Bush is almost like a boy scout compared 
to most other recent POTUS's, and he'll admit Nixon did some good things in 
trying to reign in the CIA within the CIA. While not doing any rehab jobs 
on these 𖥐𖦪𖠢𖢧𖥣ꛘ𖨚 either. 

What I appreciate about these realist takes from Aaron is that you get that 
vibe that he's not going to just paint all conservatives with the same brush, 
and that he is well aware the distinctions matter. Nevertheless, he'll point 
out Nixon and H.W. Bush were still deeply part of the gangster-mafia-zionist 
State we call the USA. And they are not even the Tony Soparano's. According 
to Aaron, and I agree, there are no Tony Soprano's. Or, I guess,the closest 
might be JFK and RFK? 

Actually, I do not know who Tony Soprano is,${}^\dagger$ I just pick up a 
feeling he was 
some sort of "family man" sympathetic mobster? In other words, a complete 
fantasy, conjured up by the corporate entertainment cartel complex to sell 
advertising in prime time while making nasty "gangsta" behaviour seem "cool". 
Is that not the case? Anyway, I don't care, that's what I'm going with.

${}^\dagger$For my monthly or weekly aculturating brainwashing and 
mind-control, I tend to go more for SciFi and weird stuff, like 
The Cohen Brothers, or Noah Hawley, or Paul Thomas Anderson. And All Blacks 
rugby --- a losing AB team is pretty weird don't you think, on top of how 
weird a gladiatorial sport like rugby is already?  It's hard to find good 
weird though. You cannot put China Mieville on the screen I reckon, 
probably shouldn't even try.

## Aaron Bad

A hope one day Aaron realizes how ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ he is, advocating for the goodness of Bretton-Woods gold standard and whatnot. He is advocating piracy, basically.

He does not know it of course, so I'm still able to get some education 
from his content, it's just layered with cringe now, which is slightly 
uncomfortable for my neurons.

It's depressingly ironic too, since he'll interview Christian Parenti and 
nod along when Parenti points out people on the liberal-left are dupes and 
rubes for thinking the American empire is just a few rotten apples spoiling 
an otherwise Boy Scout and Girl Guide democratic system (or republic if you 
wannabe pedantic).

That correct of Parenti's is correct of course, but sometimes you have to 
have the same curiosity and thick skin to question your own radical leftism, 
like when you still believe in the reich-wing Thatcherite talking point spew.

Aaron was regurgitating this vomit on an (otherwise good)) episode on the 
JFK assassination within some journo by the name of Weisce(sp?). They went full 
Austrian School right-wing on me, advocating a permanent vacation to 
New Hampshire (Bretton-Woods).

Let's be clear: when you advocate the government redeem their scorepoints 
for gold, you are boosting deflation, fascism, unemployment and things 
worse than any war or genocide you can possibly imagine.

Yeah, so may be **_don't do that?_**

Do I need to write a damn thesis on this, or a book no one will buy? Seems 
someone should. 

## Liberal Retardedness

I know one is not supposed to use the R-word these days, but I did not get 
that memo. The sentiment is correct. The liberal Indie media is just as bad 
as the mainstream media in many ways. Just because a corporate tycoon is not 
paying your salary only inoculates you against one form of groupthink, the 
form you know you do not want to parrot. But the (I'd say fake) leftist-liberal 
media does us absolutely no good when repeating right-wing talking points, 
and boosting the neoliberal project.

The neoliberal project is not necessarily "small government" it is fascistic 
government to protect the ownership class, the investors, the property-owners 
and rentiers. The "super rich" to put it simply. All "deregulation" is massive 
regulation (failure to regulate by regulatory design.) It's neoliberal speak 
to call it deregulation. What it is amounts to regulations to immunize the 
mafia (capitalists) from democratic constraint, and instead provide big 
government protections for the mafia-plutocrats.

This is the proper take-way from all this recent JEE biz. Not the sex crimes. 
The corporate mafia do far worse than sex trafficking. They've killed young 
boys in quasi-satanic sex rituals for sure, but worse than that, they've 
killed your hope for a democracy. Although, treading more gently, one cannot 
place an easy relative scale of evil on such things. Human beings are weird 
and defy utilitarian calculus in this regard. One child's life is worth more 
than millions of workers, since the workers can always have the option of 
unifying to protect themselves.  But I hope you see my point. Why did the 
sex traffic rings come into existence ion the first place?

And saying the government 
needs to get the government scorepoints "off the tax payers" is boosting 
this project massively. It is the other side to privatization putsch.

Why would a government, or think tank, or mainstream journalist, or Indie 
journalist, ... anyone!... even yourself...  be able to fool you into 
thinking public utilities & services should be privatized? A huge part of that 
is the myth that the tax payers is funding the government.

The truth is the exact reverse.

This arises every single day. I cannot get a day without hearing this 
Thatcherite vomit --- unless I retreat to my physics research and stay away 
from Indie news consumption.  It is so depressing.  Today it was some 
fake-leftie-liberal outfit complaining about the hundreds of FBI staffers 
asked to comb through the JEE Files to redact any mention of DJT.

(The issue was "why no whistle-blowers?" --- a point I will get back to 
in a minute.)

Good use of tax payers?🤣  Not a use of a single tax payer dollar though, 
which would be counterfeit. 

It did not "cost the tax payers" a single dime... to do all this hard 
redacting soul-destroying "p̶u̶b̶l̶i̶c̶  DJT benefit work."  Are you all counterfeiting 
the currency now? 

Please then do not spread reich-wing Thatcherite myths.  There is 
no "tax payer funded" monopoly currency issuer, it is an inapplicable concept. 
When the government spends _that_ *funds the tax payer,* not the other way 
around. When recipients of government spending (including welfare beneficiaries) 
spend their government scorepoints, say on rent or groceries, that's funding 
the _private sector,_ not the public sector. If you believe otherwise you'll 
never have genuine "free" healthcare, GND, etc.  The government cannot run 
out if Its own scorepoints (hence can always fully employ teachers, nurses, 
builders, etc), but can run out of qualified teachers, nurses, builders,. etc.

It's like you liberals and fake-leftists just don't want to win. You just want 
to score political points. See Whitney Webb's --- One Nation Under Blackmail.

Governments need to get _real resources_ to provision the public sector, not 
their own scorepoints. They need you and me to need their _otherwise worthless_ 
scorepoints, that's why the tax liability is imposed. Tax return (revenue ~ 
_revenir_ ~ "return back to the issuer") is a redemption operation, the 
government backing their promise to extinguish your tax liability. 
     
When the government thus spends to hire the unemployed they 
generate _by design_ they are reversing the damage caused by imposing tax 
liabilities, if they fail to run full employment it is a policy mistake. 
Full employment is not an inflation risk, since the private sector bid for 
unemployed labour is by definition ZERO.  Issuing needless government bonds 
(interest rate floor maintenance) also is not funding the government, but is 
a massive source of continual inflation = _basic income 
but **only for people who already have money** and in proportion to how much 
money they already have._

I hate to have to be using my time to make these nerdy points, but you 
aught to listen up Aaron, because it is far more destructive to go with 
the "tax payer funded" myth and the "benefits of a gold peg" than any 
genocide any time, in any place. 
So understand, this MMT education, for me, is not just a nerd debate about 
details of government policy, or how to fund a Green New Deal. No. It is 
about mass deaths on a scale worse than any holocaust in history. 


## Gold Standard is for NASA

I think radiation shedding is the only decent use for the metal. It's a 
mildly useful catalyst as far as I know, maybe good for some nanoscale 
niche "green energy" and biomedical applications (gold is "bio-compatible)) 
and REALLY not much good for anything ELSE other than detailed 
opto-electronics and whatnot.

We have a perfectly good currency anchor, our labour. We do not ever need 
anything else. 

That said, gold is of tremendous beautiful use in encouraging piracy 
and fascism. get people wanting a gold commodity peg and you generate all 
the more ꕒꗍꖀ𐝥ꗍꘝꕯꖡ folks K. Marx needed to exist in order to sell his books.
(I'm not saying K. Marx was a pre-CIA CIA plant, but he was a useful idiot 
for the capitalists.) 

((That is a wider topic I do not have the energy for today, but it gels 
with Aaron Good's thesis; that plenty of _soi dissant_ leftists are acting
as useful idiots. Me too probably. Whenever we give the conservatives 
something to complain about but which is not necessary (like quite-a-lot-of 
welfare spending, or sex change surgery subsidies for military personal, or 
mandatory "DEI training") then we are shooting the working class and poor 
in the proverbial head.
You don't want to give needless fuel to the Tories, right behind them 
stoking the flames of war are the necons and fascists.))

Before you tut-tut me for being a marxist traitor, it might be worth noting 
that; **(a)** I have never been a marxist, I just reject all ideological 
labels, they're not useful, **(b)** Marxism has some useful ideas worth knowing (e.g., labour 
exploitation = bad, workers are the source of their own emancipation), 
**(c)** why are you bothering me anyway, I'm a nobody, go form your own opinions, 
**(d)** I've come across fools who say "Marx admired capitalism" and I wanna 
say somethin' 'bout that.

I doubt Marx admired capitalism, but whether he did or not it's neither here nor 
there.  Seems to me that old dead white German guy-with-a-fierce-beard-who-did-not-understand-money, admired what machine production systems could 
produce, at relatively low energy throughput compared to human manual labour.

But that's not Capitalism. justsayin.

(Also, what's to admire really? I'd prefer less facotries, and more local 
crafts. We don't need half the stuff we produce in factories to live decent 
lives. Thinking we do is a disease of Materialism. The Veblen critique 
I gather --- status‑seeking through possessions and government scorepoints, 
rather than selfless altruism and socialistic activities.${}^\dagger$)

${}^\dagger$On the other hand, I am in favour of investment in fusion energy 
research. Just because it is cool. If we get sustainable non-polluting 
(fat chances) break-even, that's a bonus. Just the science advance of 
getting a friggin's star sitting on the Earth, will be a wonderful human 
achievement. Regardless of whether it can be a source of clean energy or 
not. What I am dead against is the hype and grift of the "boundless energy" 
promises. (I am still a neoluddite.) Total nonsense all that hype. Fusion reactors 
create nasty radiaoactive waste. We're better off cutting back on electricity 
and using more solar and geothermal.  This is an MMT issue. The incessant need 
for ever-more power (literal electricity power) is born of neoclassical 
economics where the government cannot fund stuff without robbing the 
"tax payer".  "Howso?" you ask. Well, sorry but that's another essay. In short: 
it's due to the false banking model closed-credit cycle "loanable fund" 
money myth plus the inflaton boogeyman. 

It is not only gross ignorance to spread lies about the need for a gold peg, 
it is incompetent, it is advocating for piracy, it is regressive in ways more 
horrific than the Gaza genocide, by several orders of magnitude.

I wish someone would get this message to Aaron, so he could reflect upon it 
from one radical to another. To help him stop swallowing the neoliberal 
koolaid still in his noggin refrigerator that he thinks is pleasant 
(pseudo)intellectual orange juice. Let Aaron put his heart 
where his mouth is and have an open mind about MMT. 

I'd be willing to chat with him in private, or in public.
The depressing thing is I think Steve Grumbine already has, but it seemed 
to go in one ear out the other. Grumbine has done more than anyone I know to 
get the anti-austerity message through to leftists and conservatives like.
You don't like calling them fake-leftists, but if they let it all go in one 
ear and out the other then in my mind they probably are fake leftists.

By the way, I do like this trend of calling-out "fake leftists." (Pro-Israel 
zionists, anti-Russian fear-mongers, protect "US" from the 
non-freedom -loving-Chinese sinophobes, vote-blue for non-mafia capitalism 
rubes, etc.) We need such social discourse corrective forces. Even if it is 
painful for the psyche sometimes to get "called out."
 
Who can honestly say they are 100% genuine article?  The point is though, 
many can say they are 100% genuine in their hearts, honestly, which is the 
good thing. It's what spews out their mouth that troubles me.  But the 
Parenti's et al need to apply this to themselves. Every time they 𝔅ꕯꖡꖀꖾ 
about,  "me tax payer dollars..." they are fake-leftists themselves, parroting 
extreme right-wing myths.


## Deindustrialization Was Good

Last point I think: Aaron was also complaining (like a MAGA/Tory) about the badness 
of US deindustrialization. Well, I agree it has been bad --- bad for the 
Chinese factory worker.

Too much of a hot take?

I don't think so. We should not want to ramp-back up factory production 
in the USA. Who the heck wants the USA to make more weapons and automobiles? 
Not me. Better they stick to more Burger King and Starbucks the slower 
more benign forms of social poison.

As I hinted at above regarding China versus say Vietnam. China seem pretty 
wise, they are domestically reducing some industry, and farming it out to 
other countries. But is still reeks of neocolonialism, just not as mentally 
deficient and self-defeating as "the Wests" version.  Deindustrialization 
without deindustrialization. They seem 
(dimly) aware this is not a domestic unemployment story. But since (as per 
[Jane Hayward’s notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h8HI4tDiL0), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5r9L0Cc4I0&t=224s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA88meNq7OE&t=337s)) China is still a 
state-sponsored capitalistic nation, like most, they've not 
truly realized the source of their residual unemployment either, which is a 
tragedy. The USA just had the same policy negligence but in spades, so 
heckuva lot worse tragedy.

So I'd put it that Chinese deindustrialization is merely "less bad." 
That's because the Chinese culture (I think) is more trade oriented, less 
piracy oriented.

One positive angle on this would be that the worker populations the Chinese 
are seeking to exploit (mostly in Africa?) are wisening up themselves, and 
chance are will refuse to be the world's new exploited factory workers. One may hope.

Point being, it takes workers, not enlightened bosses, to distribute 
factory work equitably around the world, and avoid any one nation 
exploiting either their own workers (industrialization) or another nation's 
workers (deindustrialization).

The only people truly benefiting from all industrialization are those who 
do not have to work in the factory. Everyone else is either reduced to 
welfare begging or wage-slave labour. The justification of "raising standards 
of living" or "moving people out of poverty" is a weak excuse, and is not an 
excuse for propping up capitalism.

Note: a market economy with factory work, is not capitalism. Capitalism is 
when an exclusive (fluid too) class of people own the means of production 
and exploit labour. Or, let's say, factory work does not _have to be_ 
capitalist, yet can still be within a market economy. The worker cooperative 
can run the factory, probably a lot more efficiently than the capitalists. 
But also let's work hard _now_ to not need so many factories, without 
sacrificing our smartphones and fancy footwear. And 
let's all try to cut back on non-essentials, without getting all (fake) 
moralistic and judgy or preachy about it. Just each day figure out what 
else you do not truly need to be happy.

When the State owns the means of production it can still 
be "capitalistic" --- the critical thing is not the ownership _per se_, it 
is the exploitation of labour. Better then the workers have control over 
their lives, both at home and at work. That is what is anti-capitalist. (Not 
just, "let's get rid of factories."  Much as I would like to get rid of human 
labour run factories and warehouses.)

I'm not trying to ignore all the nuances, I just don't have the energy to 
jot them all down. I'd just agree that it'd be rather nice for the Chinese 
factory workers if the USA workers got back into US factories a bit. 
But really I don't want any people "back" in factories. I want them all out 
of the factories. Robots in. People out.

Do you need reminder that we wake up every day to severe labour shortages!!! 
Hence every worker released from a factory is a potential benefit to society. 
But you have to employ them! They're of little benefit if placated with a 
pittance of a "ubi" (giant "𝔘𝔠𝔎𝕪𝕠𝕦" to all workers). A decent government 
can always employ people, without telling them explicitly what to work on --- 
it can be left to local communities to figure out what they need. Probably 
more local community gardens and low scale renewable production (not just of electricity).

The labour justifies the wages. 

A welfare hand-out does not justify.

* Welfare is the State's unjustified claim on other people's labour. 
* A Job Guarantee is our justified claim on the State (the State caused 
all the unemployment in the first instance).

But as any MMT'er will probably say, there are many good people who cannot 
work or who should not be working. I'd just say don't say we are charitably 
giving the welfare. No. That's condenscending ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ. We are still 
employing people when they receive government income. They all have something 
to contribute to society. It is not up to you, me, nor the state to tell 
people getting governemtn guaranteed income what they shoudl be doing if 
they cannot or shoudl nto be wgae-workers.  

It is up to civil society to only say what they should **_not_** be doing. 
(Lighting houses on fire, d̶e̶s̶t̶r̶o̶y̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶T̶e̶s̶l̶a̶ ̶a̶u̶t̶o̶m̶o̶b̶i̶l̶e̶s̶ 
making pro-neoliberal graffiti,  making snuff films...) --- but as well as 
being up to civil society at large to engage in 
decent basic education so people do not even need to be told what not to do.

The 
handicapped and the elderly should not be solely dependent upon a family 
member for their livelihood, not in a monetary system. Every school kid is 
justifying a teacher. Every elderly person or handicapped/disabled person 
needing care is justifying the care worker. 

We don't want Keynesian teachers: teachers paid to indoctrinate kids one 
year, then paid to reverse it the next year. (This is what we currently do,
to some extent, with lower schools being neoliberalized, and only near the 
end of university do we have a few decent academics reversing that damage... 
if you are lucky.)

Likewise we do not want Keynesian welfare: government crippling people one 
year than trying to fix it with welfare the next. (Politicizes welfare. Class 
warfare --- the need for liberals to keep some people poor & desperate to 
given the condescending liberals (more often conservatives) a perennial sense 
of self-righteous charitable superiority. ꖾꗍꝆꝆꛘꗞ 
to that I say!  ꘝꖾꖹꖀꗣ off to Mars with your UBI brainworms.)

What about the Robots?

Well, I guess not _everything_ Andrew Yang said was complete madness, as 
shocking as that may seem, since I think he is basically a fascist (an 
over-used term these days? Maybe, but  not in this case.) Also, not
everything Yanis Varioufakis says is dopey, just some of it.
But please do not tell me "there is so much to be done" out one side of your 
mouth and scream bloody murder about "robots (or immigrants) taking away 
the jobs" out the other side. That's Davos groupthink brainworms.

But has anyone been doing robot automation of robot manufacturing? Probably 
not much outside of the military, right?  Anyway, you hardly hear anything 
of this, instead all the focus is on LLM's. Guys. The LLM's cannot automate 
away the ꕷꖾꕯꖡꖡꔇ jobs. So stop worrying about LLM's. The leftist pro-worker 
project needs to be on getting robotics going with the resources we have 
sustainably available, not on millions of acres of serer farms funded by 
advertising to produce slop ---  slop for no real public benefit --- and slop 
that many people are too easily fooled into thinking is "intelligent."
