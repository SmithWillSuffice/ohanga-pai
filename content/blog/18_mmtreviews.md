Following on from the [Questions](ohangapai/questions/20_peripherynations) chapter 
I wrote last week "[MMT and the Periphery](../20_peripherynations)" commentary, 
I thought it might be useful to critically review the defences of MMT, from a hard 
core MMT perspective (that's me). At least I think I am hard core. 
As in what [Buttercup said to Bubbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBPiMHkgx8). 
What I'd mean by that is taking a view that the Mosler *MMT Base Case* is in fact 
realizable in the real world.

But what does *that* mean?

It means a strong enough government (meaning it has the backing of a majority of the 
population in real terms, not mere votes) can instruct their central bank to 
institute ZIRP, and run a decent Job Guarantee program. We should throw in various 
banking reforms to "make banking boring again" --- the [Mosler narrow banking proposals](https://moslereconomics.com/2009/09/16/proposals-for-the-banking-system-treasury-fed-and-fdic-draft/). But otherwise MMT is not prescriptive 
for all sorts of other hot button culture war issues. The MMT Base Case admits 
whatever the culture war presently gives you.

This is no failing of MMT. If you get nasty culture that's on you and your people.
MMT would probably run very well if complemented by a decent society, say in Finland, 
New Zealand or Costa Rica.  Dick Cheney shows you how *aspects of* (not the whole of) 
MMT works in a messed up culture.

That last statement is suss of course, since the USA is already "doing MMT" for a 
long while. What we mean here is running the Base Case for analysis, which the neocon 
Bush Administration warmongers certainly did not "do". Nor did anyone from Washington 
to to Biden.



## Why "MMArt"?

Most orthodox economics critiques of MMT construct a straw man, but not in a good way. 
A good straw man might be Mosler's MMT Base Case, since no country on Earth is 
operating this base case, so you have to imagine it. That's a proper straw man, but 
then of course the critique is not a straw man fallacy. It'd be a theoretical 
analysis, and could be good and proper. But this is not what we find in the academic 
journals.

In the academic journals, and newspapers, we find utterly fanciful fabrications of 
something bizarre, that people think is "MMT" but which is no such thing. These give 
rise to proper straw man fallacies. It can look pretty to an orthodox economist of 
course. It is MMArt. You could insert an "F" there before the "A", but it'd be the 
mainstream economists emitting the smellies.


## Muscle Flexing Score

I am going to start with a perhaps less well read defence of MMT from 
[Eric Tymoigne (2022)](https://doi.org/10.4337/ejeep.2022.0092), which I think is 
good because it is less well known, but also because it takes on a particularly dull 
yet weirdly fanatical anti-MMT critique by 
[Drumetz and Pfister (2021)](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/ejeep/aop/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092.xml#ref-021), and 
the fanaticism in the latter makes it relatively less dull, than say a moderately 
"good faith" critique by someone like Tom Palley, Steve Keen or Paul Krugman.

OK, so this is an exercise. We're going to see if Eric Tymoigne mounted a good 
defence, and see what he could've written better. Before I even begin reading it 
(this is an *extra* exercise I like to do, to predict my own response ahead of time, 
only possible in a blog, you cannot get this sort of stuff published in academic 
journals) I am going to guess what my reaction will be.

I am guessing Tymigne will do a fair job, accurate, but missing some critical 
spiritual principles and moral analysis. MMT needs defence not *only* because it is 
accurate, but because this matters, it matters a helluva lot. This, I believe, 
Tymoigne is going to entirely miss.

So we'll give him strength, style, streetsmart, and Blackadder points. 
I'm predicting 60 to 70 out of 100 points. Maybe 80, since Tymoigne is no slouch and 
seems to be a bit of a progressive "leftie". Progressive lefties tend to be overly 
geeky and analytical, lacking humour, and too willing to display "scientific" 
credentials to the detriment, or maybe just the de-emphasis, of the more important 
moral and ethical principles. I do not really know why this is (I am a progressive 
leftie myself, so atypical) but it is what it is, perhaps some blind subconscious 
allegiance to Marxism (a supposed "materialist" philosophy devoid of spirituality 
when taken irreligiously, which is to say [religiously](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html)).

((Of course, I've written this elsewhere: Marx was certainly a very spiritual guy, 
since his heart was obviously deeply concerned for the plight of the poor and the 
needless suffering of the working class. (Needless, that is, if you're not a rentier 
capitalist.)  He was also arrogant (anti-spiritual quality) and pompous, and lacked 
a scientific investigation of monetary economics and real production. Just sayin'.))

Let's get on with the Marxometer muscle flexing scoring then...

### Marxometer Readings

TODO: only just getting started. This is a stub.

## Style Points

For style points we need to pull out the Keltonometer.



## Street Populism 

It is tricky to assess streetsmart points. The Moslerometer would normally do, but 
suffers from calibration uncertainty owing to logarithmic scale jumps when encountering 
neoclassicals, and I have not learned to do the stochastic equilibrium calibration 
corrections. The ThomasFrankerator however is a very simple device and soft enough it 
can also be used to slap orthodox economists after use, which is a handy dual purpose. 
The Moslerometer is more sensitive and requires recuperation in the Caribbean tropics 
after use, so I'm going with the ThomasFrankerator.



## Blackadder Points

The easiest thing to do here in-person is to pull out the Python Holy Grail and see 
if its waters sizzle Tymoigne's skin. But lacking Tymoigne in person, we resort to the
Chaplinograph, which produces a silent black & white test. No ambiguity here.
