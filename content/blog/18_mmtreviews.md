Following on from the [Questions](ohangapai/questions/20_peripherynations) chapter I wrote last week "[MMT and the Periphery](../20_peripherynations)" commentary, 
I thought it might be useful to critically review the defences of MMT, from a hard 
core MMT perspective (that's me). At leats I think I am hard core. What I'd mena by 
that is taking a view that the Mosler *MMT Base Case* is in fact realizable in the real world.

But what does *that* mean?



## Why "MMArt"?

Most orthodox economist critiques of MMT construct a straw man, but not in a good way. 
A good straw man might be Mosler's MMT Base Case, since no country on Earth is 
operating this base case, so you have to imagine it. That's a proper straw man, but 
then of course the critique is not a straw man fallacy. It'd be a theoretical 
analysis, and could be good and proper. But this is not what we find in the academic 
journals.

In the academic journals, and newspapers, we find utterly fanciful fabrications of 
something bizarre, that people think is "MMT" but which is no such thing. It can look 
pretty to an orthodox economist of course. It is MMArt.
You could insert an "F" there before the "A", but it'd be the mainstream economists 
emitting the smellies.


## Muscle Flexing Score

I am going to start with a perhaps less well read defence of MMT from [Eric Tymoigne (2022)](https://doi.org/10.4337/ejeep.2022.0092), which I think is good because it is less well known, but also because it takes on a particularly dull yet weirdly fanatical anti-MMT critique by [Drumetz and Pfister (2021)](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/ejeep/aop/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092/article-10.4337-ejeep.2022.0092.xml#ref-021), and the fanaticism in the latter makes it relatively less dull, than say a moderately "good faith" critique by someone like Tom Palley or Paul Krugman.


OK, so this is an exercise. We're going to see if Eric Tymoigne mounted a good defence, and see what he could've written better. Before I even begin reading it (this is an *extra* exercise I like to do, to predict my own response ahead of time, only possible in a blog, you cannot get this sort of stuff published in academic journals) I am going to 

```TODO: only just getting started. This is a stub.
