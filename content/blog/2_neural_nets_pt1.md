I plan to be teaming up with my new friend Douglas over are MMT Macro Trader. 
We hope to be publishing research on use of convolutional neural net LTSM algorithms 
for predicting forward returns on the SPX. 

## Macro Finance

I am doing this to further MMT education and research relevant to "very macro" 
stock market index fund data.  The idea is that even though finance bros hate MMT, 
they cannot ignore MMT if the knowledge of the relevance of fiscal flows and 
sectoral balances gives them a superior prediction algorithm,

While no algorithm's success as a predictor is proof the theory behind the algorithm is true, 
it is a necessary condition for the theory to be true.  (Necessary, but not sufficient.)

Douglas and I are happy for now to show you a few necessary conditions for MMT are true.

## Microfinance

It is not so easy to develop microfinance predictors using MMT. However, economics is a 
funny sort of system. It is engineered and run by human beings, and in economics the 
macro very often impinges upon the micro in ways that say Neoclassical or Austrian School economists simply could not comprehend.  The finance bros from those schools tend to be, "Oh, but we are *all* about the bottom-up."

Which is fine, for what it can get you.

But when a dynamical system has strong top-own causation, a bottom-up analysis is going 
to miss a lot, and predictors re not going to be as good as those that are appropriately 
informed by a macro analysis.

At present we do not know what the macroeconomic MMT analysis can do for improving 
microeconomic predictors, and so this is not our active focus of research. 
But it is a fascinating area to think about developing.  
Let us know if you think you have an insight into how to get such research going.

We suspect machine learning models, and neural nets in particular, 
will be good tools for ding first level analysis just to see what the causal relations 
might probabilistically be --- between the macro and the micro.

So the research paradigm would be to use ANN's initially to just figure out the relations. 
Not to predict anything at first.  Just to sort out how the macroeconomic flows feed into 
various sectors at the level of firms and households (so still partially macroscopic units). 
This would be more properly terms **_mesoeconomic analysis_**.


### Contributions?

If you think such research sounds exciting, please help us. You can contribute almost 
anything in the realms of code, ideas, or funding. If you can help fund our research 
we will give back.
