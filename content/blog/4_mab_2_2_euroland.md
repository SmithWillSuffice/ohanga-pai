I will be writing the odd blog post over the next month commenting on highlights from Perry Mehrling's MOOC on [Money and Banking - online from INET](https://www.ineteconomics.org/education/courses/the-economics-of-money-banking).

Today it's a comment on when Mehrling starts out by alerting his students that he is going to talk about the ECB "as if" it were a private entity, and then only in later lectures talk about money as a creation of the state.

I thought this is completely the wrong emphasis. The euro is an MMT system, but very 
weirdly structured so as to look and function like a private or endogenous currency 
system. But that is one of the veils of money.

It is easy to make a state currency system (MMT) look like a private currency.

Just listen to all the lunatics who claim the US FED is a private bank! 
They obviously all believe the US dollar is created by the FED and not by Congress.
They are complete nutters.
But it is easy to forgive them, because Congress also acts like the FED is a hands-off 
private entity. So it is a little unfair to blame the nutters for their warped views. 
Those in power controlling the USA MMT system share a lot of those warped views.

((What is weird here is that in the USA at least, some of the EU, the nutters also 
tend to hate government, and yet are following the government narrative. However, 
this weirdness can be explained: those same nutters are often the ones getting 
elected into government. Yeah. People who hate government are running governments.
And why not? From their perspective, the best way to destroy something truly well is often from the inside. This is why we gotta stop electing them.))

If enough people playing a baseball game think it is cricket, what you will observe is 
a cricket game played with catching mitts and awkwardly rounded bats.
You see the duality? What does not change are the field, the mitts, the ball,
and the bats, but what is weird is how people use that equipment, the result is a 
terrible game of cricket, or a worse game of baseball. (One of those is analogous to 
the USA, the other to the EU, perhaps? I am not sure which is more appropriate a 
mapping.)

But how is Mehrling any different to the nutters?

I think Mehrling understands the basics of MMT, but if you do, then I think the moral 
obligation is to talk about the true account of currency monopoly first, which means 
the state theory of money has to go first, because it is primary. Pedagogically order 
matters.

**Aside:** You can tell bad teachers from the good ones by the order in which they teach topics. I've had this in physics. The best way to teach quantum mechanics is 
to tell the truth first, before the mathematical formalism, which is that: 

> *We have no clue what the ontological basis for quantum mechanics is, so everything 
to follow is pure descriptive formalism.*  The wavefunction is not ontology. So don't try to construct an ontology based on the properties of the wavefunction.

((An even better physics teacher might add: although we do not think the wavefunction 
is ontology, it could be ontology. The point is we do not know, so do not second guess 
nature. It is ok to conjecture an ontology then test it.))

However, the ECB certainly does function a lot like a private currency endogenous 
money system, but that is only because that is the way the governments seem to wish 
it to be. And here by "the governments" we really mean those in power.  And those in 
power in Europe are wannabe oligarchs, so yeah, they are highly prone to abusing the 
state currency system and treating it like a private currency system. This is a major 
source of the mess in euroland.

## Hierarchy of Money

[Here is the relvant bit from the lecture](https://youtu.be/XB2DFuAP8SY?list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&t=51).
On this I commented:

All well and good to "treat" the ECB as a "bankers bank" if indeed that is what it 
is, but it is not, it is a creation of the EU, so is a creation of government(s) the 
problem being that is a plural, so only the more powerful members of the EU (Germany, 
France, Belgium) really have what is akin to monopoly currency issuing capacity. 
Contrast with the USA where Congress has all the monopoly, since they can fire the 
FED Board with a vote. The nuance that should be put up-front is that these 
governments are *de facto* owned by the bankers and oligarchs, through distortion of 
democracy. So legalistically Mehrling is wrong to claim the central banks are 
private institutions, but functionally he is kind of right, but only because the 
demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively _want_ to be beholden to 
private oligarch interests (most neolib politicians aspire to be members of the 
oligarchy).

OK.

But the fact the monetary system gets abused in several ways makes Mehrling's point 
about the hierarchy of financial instruments a reality, and a seriously big f-ing 
problem.

For social stability we need *like things* and production equivalences to remain rough 
equivalences, as in trade parity principles. The predatory financial speculators and 
merchants of financial ponzi schemes, tariffs, and other banking corruptions, mess 
this up.

One nation's tariffs become another's subsidies. You cannot expect a people who get 
squeezed by unfair prices to not fight back, and if they are lucky their government 
will fight back for them.

I guess to be fair to Mehrling, if the aim is to learn how to think like a central 
banker, then he has a fair point in leading with the ECB as "a bankers bank." 
What I am saying is why the F would any student want to learn how to think like a 
central banker *first*? First is a bias.

So *first* you want students to think like expertly informed workers, who understand 
the (MMT) system, and understand the abuse of it. Then later it is fine to teach them 
how central bankers view the system, and why the central bankers are wrong.


## Credit is not money? 

About 2 minutes into the lecture segment Mehrling seems to take pains to claim 
"Money is *not* credit." 

Here he is just plain wrong, at least in language framing. 

He starts with one view of his hierarchy of money: with "gold is the ultimate 
money".  Which is cringe. Gold has never been money. A gold standard is not a regime 
where gold is money, it is a regime where temporarily (as long as trust in gold 
supply lasts) a government or other currency issuer promises to redeem for gold. When 
the gold runs out (or is known to be running out) they always get off the gold 
standard until some later time when gold reserves are grabbed back. It is a charade. 
No one ever uses the gold for purchasing, it is just a place-holder, just like grain 
weights of wheat, corn or barley were used in ancient times, they are just 
placeholders for the currency unit. People (who are not fetishists) do not want or 
need gold, they want the credits. They need to eat, so they want bread, not gold. 
The metal form of the currency is irrelevant.

All money is an I.O.U of the issuer. So all money is someone's credit (whoever 
receives the IOU) and all money is equally someone's debt (the debt of the issuer).
But you might think I am being pedantic?

It was almost too cringe to listen to the rest of this lecture segment. Mehrling 
claims money is how the credit is repaid. True, but that just means money is the 
credit. Because in a single currency system all credits and debits are in the same 
units. It is all the same money form. 

What Mehrling is getting at is a subtler point, which is that when you have positive 
digits in your bank account, or coins or notes in your pocket, then these are unique 
IOU's, because they are the only IOU's on Earth that you can redeem for tax liability 
extinction. That is why state money *seems* different to bank credit, but if they are 
denominated in the same units then there is no difference, both forms are tax credits, 
operationally and legally.  The difference is in the process of how you get them into your bank account, or wallet.

But when the government says by fiat that their tax credit redeems for gold, they are not thereby making the gold the money. They are making gold the buffer stock.
I do not think Mehrling understands this, but it is a critical thing to understand.

What else Mehrling *really* means is that commercial bank credit (endogenous money) is 
not the same as state currency (exogenous money).

This is in agreement with MMT, and in agreement with all legal and operational reality 
in most nations, outside those who use a foreign currency as their tax credits.

The difference of course is stark, so I am *not* being pedantic. There are painful 
realities to taking on bank debt. You get the credit initially, along with signing an 
explicit or one-time (credit card) agreement to repay. Then you spend, or why else 
use a credit card? So your credit gets moved into someone else's bank account, they 
are now in credit to the bank, and you are in debt, equally, at least until the 
interest charges accrue.

But when the interest charges accrue the bank gains more credit upon you, and you 
gain more in debt, dollar for dollar. So sure enough, endogenously, all credit is 
debt.

However, it holds exogenous as well, but in an entirely different way, with profoundly 
different consequences, and this is the MMT account of state currency. The state 
issues their currency by fiat, not by credit. You do not really need to pay it back.
However, someone has to pay some fraction of it back, due to imposed tax liabilities. 
But these are generalized arrangements, and can be arranged so that the poorest people 
need pay no tax return. 
That is the difference.

Whether you are poor or rich, if you receive bank debt you must repay, or lose your 
house, or file for bankruptcy. But if you receive government currency you do not 
*have* to repay --- so, for instance, if you are unfortunately poor then  someone else 
will have to pay some fraction of the state's currency back to the state.
The need to repay the government's currency is thus not because the receiver (a public 
sector worker, or welfare beneficiary, or contractor) has taken upon a debt burden, in 
fact it is the opposite, the government has the debt burden.

It is only *society as a whole* that has the tax liability burden, and that is by 
design, so that, in principle, the operation of the fiat currency can work without 
the poorest shouldering the burden. Since taxation is what drives the demand for the 
state currency someone has to have the tax liability imposed upon them, and so more 
justly that should be those who accumulate the most, by failing to spend and circulate 
their income, they aught to bear most of the tax return burden --- if we have a well designed system.

But once bank credit goes into someone else's wallet, they cannot distinguish it 
from government currency, because it is the same unit. A kilogram is a kilogram 
whether it is a chicken being weighed or a brick. It is only macroeconomically that 
the distinction between the issuing operations gets fully noticed: in the ratio of 
private debt to government issue (or the ratio of private debt to GDP). 

If private debt is too much higher than government fiat issue, and is growing faster, 
then we have a severe recessionary bias, and totally needlessly.

Also --- and maybe this is something Mehrling gets wrong later on (I am not yet sure) 
--- the bank credit money is only as in demand as the government fiat currency, since 
the government licences the banks, and the bank money to any creditors is equivalent 
to government issue, since this currency unit is the same unit.

When I say, "as in demand as" I mean generally, in the macro. Obviously people would 
prefer being given the currency for selling goods or their labour time rather than 
having to take the bank credit themselves. So it is not the bank credit that is just 
as much in demand, it is the currency, freely floating, that is in demand. Once you 
get a tax credit you don't care where it came from. Unless you are a macroeconomist 
that is, then you do care. Steve Keen's Minksy models show you why you should care. 
Bank credit sources produce instability, government issue does not.

However, when a chap like Mehrling comes along and says credit is *not* money he 
muddies the waters. It might even be poisoning the well. Because if you see "money" 
as a standalone "thing" that is no other entity's obligation or debt, then you are 
both crazy and privileging people who can "mine" that stuff out of the ground or on a 
computer or pirate the stuff.

Partly this is semantics, but in a society the semantics are incredibly important, 
and if we all have a common misunderstanding that "money" equals "some scarce stuff 
that everyone just agrees can settle payments" then you are down the cryptocurrency 
dead-end road, allowing all sorts of scams and frauds. Whereas if you take the MMT 
semantics, that all money is an IOU of the issuer --- a promise to redeem --- then you 
have at least the possibility of a just society in the payments layer. the 
possibility, because justice still needs to be fought for and protected, and MMT is 
only an intellectual weapon in that on-going spiritual war or jihad.

Why I say the semantics matters is because it makes a difference. You can easily 
pirate gold or crytocurrency (the latter is called cracking (not hacking) or a 
software back-door). But you cannot pirate records on a secured public ledger, at 
least not very easily, you have to own the ledger. Private bank deposit accounts are 
extremely secure in most nations. To the extent they are insecure they become 
pirate-able. People are tight-assed about their bank accounts, and will soon let the 
police or serious fraud office know if their account gets tampered with. To the 
extent bankers are *at bare minimum* trusted *at least* not to fiddle too much 
with the numbers in your bank account then the banking system prevents piracy. 
History shows empirically it works. 
It just works. Except when the thieves own the banks. 2008 GFC style.
(Read William Black's book, 
[\'The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One\'](https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/blab2p).)

But even in the lead-up to the 2008 GFC, no bankers were fiddling with the numbers in 
*your* bank account. They do not need to. They need to fiddle with the numbers in 
their own bank account, mark *them* ones up my dudes!
I admit this matters if done on a large scale, because the ratio of the bank account 
numbers is what matters for social equity and justice, if a million bankers can just 
mark-up their accounts by ten times that of everyone else, using a keyboard, 
they gain relatively more purchasing power, regardless of what "stuff" you think "the money" happens to be, fool.

It is the social consequences of which issuer you get the currency from that matters. 
It is better to get it as a creditor (work for government, or sell to someone) rather 
than as a debtor. You ideally, at the macro level, want the government to be the principle debtor, because they cannot run out of their won currency. This is 
the thinking behind the Positive Money movement, which unfortunately also suffers 
from insanity, so I should write about that some time.
