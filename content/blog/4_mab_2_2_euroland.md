I will be writing the odd blog post over the next month commenting on highlights from Perry Merhling's MOOC on [Money and Banking - online from INET]()

Today a comment on when Merhling starts out by alerting his students that he is going to talk about the ECB "as if" it were a private entity, and then only in later lectures talk about money as a creation of the state.

I thought this is completely the wrong emphasis. The euro is an MMT system, but very 
weirdly structured so as to look and function like a private or endogenous currency 
system. But that is one of the veils of money.

It is easy t make a state currency system (MMMT) look like a private currency.

Just listen to all the lunatics who claim the US FED is a private bank! 
They obviously all believe the US dollar is created by the FED and not by Congress.
They are complete nutters.
But it is easy to forgive them, because Congress also acts like the FED is a hands-off 
private entity. So it is a little unfair to blame the nutters for their warped views. 
Those in power controlling the USA MMT system share a lot of those warped views.

If enough people playing a baseball game think it is cricket, what you will observe is 
a cricket game played with catching mitts and awkwardly rounded bats.
You see the duality? What does not change are the field, the mitts, the ball,
and the bats, but what is weird is how people use that equipment, the result is a 
terrible game of cricket, or a worse game of baseball. (One of those is analogous to 
the USA, the other to the EU, perhaps? I am not sure which is more appropriate a 
mapping.)

But how is Merhling any different to the nutters?

I think Merhling understands the basics of MMT, but if you do, then I think the moral 
obligation is to talk about the true account of currency monopoly first, which means 
the state theory of money has to go first, because it is primary. 

However, the ECB certianly does function a lot like a private currency endgenous 
money system, but that is onyl becasue that is the way the governemtns seem to wish 
it to be. And here by "the governemtns" we really mena those in power.  And those in 
power in Europe are wannabe oligarchs, so yeah, they are highly prne to abusing the 
state currency system and treting it like a private currency system. THis is a major 
surce of the mess in euroland.

[Here is the relvant bit from the lecture](https://youtu.be/XB2DFuAP8SY?list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&t=51)
On this I commented:

All well and good to "treat" the ECB as a "bankers bank" if indeed that is what it 
is, but it is not, it is a creation of the EU, so is a creation of government(s) the 
problem being that is a plural, so only the more powerful members of the EU (Germany, 
France, Belgium) really have what is akin to monopoly currency issuing capacity. 
Contrast with the USA where Congress has all the monopoly, since they can fire the 
FED Board with a vote. The nuance that should be put up-front is that these 
governments are *de facto* owned by the bankers and oligarchs, through distortion of 
democracy. So legalistically Merhling is wrong to claim the central banks are 
private institutions, but functionally he is kind of right, but only because the 
demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively _want_ to be beholden to 
private oligarch interests (most neolib politicians aspire to be members of the 
oligarchy).

OK.

But the fact the monetary system gets abused in several ways makes Merhlings point 
about the hierarchy of financial instruments a reality, and a seriously big f-ing 
problem.

For social stability we need like things and production equivalences to remain rough 
equivalences, as in trade parity principles. The predatory financial speculators and 
merchants of financial ponzi schemes, tariffs, and other banking corruptions, mess 
this up.

One nation's tariffs become another's subsidies. You cannot expect a people who get 
squeezed by unfair prices to not fight back, and if they are lucky their government 
will fight back for them.

I guess to be fair to Merhling, if the aim is to learn how to think like a central 
banker, then he has a fair point in leading with the ECB as "a bankers bank." 
What I am saying is why the F would any studnet want to learn how to think like a 
central banker *first*? First is a bias.

So *first* you want students to think like expertly informed workers, who understand 
the (MMT) system, and understand the abuse of it. The later it is fine to teach them 
how central bankers view the system, and why the central bankers are wrong.
