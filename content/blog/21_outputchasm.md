Last post I wrote about the way the euroland is ponzi, which came from Warren Mosler at 
the [MMT Fiscal Sustainability Conference 2010](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvPLZsgEcXSbdqMUTc-4usIO-9f0xBlc), but that also led me to 
[Bill Mitchell\'s incredibly powerful statements](https://youtu.be/hTWEFKH144M?t=1827) 
on the massive costs of unemployment. The latter is what I want to focus more on 
today.  I think it's the single most important topic in macroeconomics. And second 
only in *political* economy to the issue of lasting world peace.


## The Output Gap

The output gap is defined as the difference between real GDP produced in a given year 
and the potential maximum GDP that *could* have been produced had all available 
resources been fully employed.

Notice a problem with that definition?

It implies slavery of some description. So we'd better fix it. We do not really want 
to estimate the "maximum potential GDP" but rather the *optimal* level of GDP from 
full resource employment.  Now what does that mean? Well, there are at least two 
problems with maximisation as compared to optimization (maybe more than two):

1. We do not want nominal GDP to be the measure, it has to be real GDP, and that also 
means we should want to count only non-bullsh*t jobs.
2. Human well-being should *also* be optimized, which is not factored in any way in the 
NIPA accounting, so we cannot just maximise output, since that will entail some sort of 
wage slavery at the very least. We do not want optimal GDP to include any wage slavery 
(coercive or brutal work conditions).


On point 1: if useless products are sold, and that gets counted as real GDP, we're 
not doing the NIPA accounts justice. We do want to count all the sh*t jobs. Those are 
necessary jobs someone has to do, which are generally considered unpleasant.

Bullsh*t jobs (as [identified by David Graeber](https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant/)) 
may or may not be pleasant work 
conditions, but are typically associated with spiritual violence ("I hate my job") and 
are jobs understood, usually by the worker, to be unnecessary for a decent human 
civilization.

On point 2: because human well-being is subjective, it is hard to quantify optimal potential GDP. We really should use some other metrics. But failing that, we can 
"do a Keynes" and for now take the recent past as the best guide to the present.
Although that's going to be conservative and regressive, it could also be considered 
a fair baseline, because the greater the well-being of workers usually the more productive and less bullsh*t the work. So a reactionary conservative posture (the recent past) will likely under-estimate the output gap.

That is ok for our purposes, because all we need to show is that the estimated
conservative output gap is still an horrific waste of human lives, a veritable crime against humanity (or should be thought of as so).

### Investors are not to blame

Let's first distinguish between investors (people buying stocks or shares in 
productive firms) from the more finance rentier types (people speculating in purely 
financial assets and derivatives --- as Mosler puts it, a total waste of human 
endeavour.)

Real investors are people with marginal savings: money they do not need, so seek to 
"put it to work" for some return on their investment.

Did not Keynes say that the drain on an economy were the rentiers and the savers --- 
people *not* spending all their income. So true.

If everyone spent all their income it would drive up supply, i.e., output, and lead 
us close to full employment, if not full non-bullsh\*t job employment. I realize 
"non-bullsh*t" is doing a lot of work here, it basically is a way of capturing the microeconomics but speaking at a macro level, so a bit dodgy.

Nevertheless, the tragedy of our times is firms do not like to hire the long term 
unemployed, and yet deliberate neoliberal policy generates long term unemployment, by 
design, due to their NAIRU myth. So we have a problem, even if everyone tried to 
spend all their income, it is unlikely firms will hire all workers. So we'd still 
have a small output gap.

However, the point to make today is that we are nowhere near full employment, and 
have not been near full employment in any major industrialized country since the 
1960's, when neoliberalism roughly started to take hold, the monetarists become 
grossly ascendant, and austerity and "belt-tightening" became the foolish order of 
the day, which the innocent public swallowed like bitter medicine (which is how PR 
firms fraudulently sold neoliberalism), or like lambs to the slaughter.

Worse than that, if you just look at the employment numbers you are failing to count 
all the truly bullsh\*t jobs. Those are _also_ massive opportunity costs, severe costs. 
What else good could these bullsh*t job workers be doing? The answer is, "a lot!"


## The Social Costs of Unemployment

The better MMT'ers list these, and here I will steal a few from 
[Wray](https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/public-service-employment-a-path-to-full-employment) and 
from [Pavlina Tcherneva](https://pavlina-tcherneva.net/the-case-for-a-job-guarantee/).

```
TODO: depression, skill loss, health loss, 
family breakup, rising dependency ratios, 
rising crime, suicide, ...
(Maybe no need to expand? Cite Tcherneva.)
```

Regardless of the massive output gap costs, never to be recovered, these social costs 
are truly horrific. Even a complete economic nerd can appreciate the cost to society 
to "treat" depression and all the other pathologies associated with long term 
involuntary unemployment dwarf the costs of inflation or a decent living wage 
non-bullsh*t job guarantee.
