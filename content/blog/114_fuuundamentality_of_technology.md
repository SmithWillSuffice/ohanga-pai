[Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/an-open-letter-to-all-those-building-ai?publication_id=69390&post_id=165097829&isFreemail=true&triedRedirect=true) 
the "war on cash" guy, posted an essay on the dangers of AI hype and grift, 
which that part I concur with.

But some of his macroeconomics framing is off imho.

But let's critically examne some of Brett's points, for they are not all 
entireoly accurate, or at least not how would frame things in the software 
industry.


**Point 1.**
> "Maybe you think you’re helping us all to get to the next level in the 
great game of human history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this, I am happy for you. Everyone 
has gifts which are meaningful to them, and which they use to form their 
identity and to express their creativity. You, as a tool-builder, are working 
with your gifts, and nobody can blame you for that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""But, I just want you to be aware that --- 
in the context of our current world --- your gifts will be weaponised, and you 
have a moral responsibility to not be naive about your own position in that 
great game of human history."

Firstly, life is not a game. The well-to-do can afford to say it is so.

Second, I am not happy for people thinking like techno-libertarians. Most of 
them are delusional. Most software is junk, most apps will be obsolete soon, 
and what remains and endures are the few critical algorithms that are common 
in all moderately complicated software.  None of these Code Warriors are 
discovering new algorithm. They are all code jockies.

Third, the moral responsibility part is 100% good.

> "... but in the end the fundamental purpose of AI is to serve the needs 
of capitalism in three ways:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Firstly, to give bosses and 
shareholders new automation technology that can be used to weaken the 
political power of their workforces by making 
labour increasingly redundant <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Secondly, to give military generals 
new capabilities to fight over and 
secure territory for further commodification <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Thirdly, to help numb out the broader 
population with streaming entertainment media, like AI-generated cat reels.


On **(1)** -- no. There is no fundamental purpose to machine 
algorithms.  The purpsoe of software is derived from the user, 
ultimately, thought the programmer probably has a typical 
user in mind.

Also, there is no such thing as "AI" it is a made-up word, 
much like "Intellectual Property". But that's a whole other 
essay for another day.

Embarrassingly, for me, Andrew Yang and other have most of the 
unemployment story correct: high tech automation does not cause 
unemployment. It causes a freedom for people to move out of dumb 
now bullshit jobs, formerly not bullshit, into big vacant holes 
in socially useful or necessary work. 

The "new" jobs --- really old socially necessary jobs 
that are just not being done --- might be very shitty 
jobs still, like nursing and teaching in lower schools, 
sanitation work, plumbing, etc. Well... they'd be shitty 
to me, gladly not so shitty for all people. It takes 
all types to make a decent society.

What Yang and the techno-libertarians 
fail to appreciate is that the source 
of all unemployment is government.

The private sector role is to produce 
real output in a market, stuff we 
all desire, but may not necessarily 
need to live a decent life.

The role of the government is to hire 
all unemployed labour. This is by design.

By imposing coercive tax liabilities (and indirectly 
by fees, fines, levies and starving local government 
of the tax credits) the government is in the 
first place, from inception, deliberately 
generating unemployment.

Unemployment is \textit{defined} as people seeking to 
exchange their goods or labour for tax credits, 
but who are unable to do so.

On **(2)** --- I have no objections to Brett's point about tech 
getting used for military ventures.  Except it rather explodes the 
self-proclaimed libertarianism of Silicon Valley. I thought genuine 
libertarians were anti-war and anti-the-M.I.C.?  The Silver Rule, and 
all that. Turns out, the techno-libertarian is Libertarian in name only.

On **(3)** --- probably. But I think the military-industrial-entertainment 
complex is a messy uncoordinated beast. It is mostly consumer choice at 
work, and no one forces you to watch LOL Cat videos or pop music slop. 
No one forces you to use a machine generated cartoon for your substack 
or youtube feature image.

Sure, the media-entertainment complex is full of rot, but it is not 
an area of social crud && cruft that we are powerless to do something 
about. It is easier to withhold your eyeballs from candy than withhold your 
labour for tax credits.

It is easier to stop using proprietary software than it is to stop 
drinking coffee.

Also, I think Brett are over-selling the AI/tech story. Most of it is 
technology we do not need to live a decent life. A ꕷꖾꔇꖡꗍ-tonne of software 
industry workers are white-knucklers who have no fun at the weekend down at 
Colorado or Burning Man etc., and who are miserable and resentful. Most of 
their code is broken and/or obsolete in a few years, and they're not building 
any useful tools, for the most part.

Also, why appeal to the higher-up the food-chain tech nerds anyway? They've 
shown they do not care, how many times do you have to see them turn a blind 
eye to human suffering? With their ultradarwinist nonsense, blind to the fact 
the government and Its regulations enabled them all to succeed. The easier 
thing to do is stop using their software. No one needs Apple Inc or Micro$oft. 
So stop pretending you need them. The out-of-work programmers can always be 
employed to do better things, start community gardens, pour espresso for me, 
teach math to kindergartners, help old people retire in dignity, help prevent 
accounting fraud, ... a million other good and useful things that will have 
lasting positive impact on society.
