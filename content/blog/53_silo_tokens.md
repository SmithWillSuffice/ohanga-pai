When I'm tired or depressed and can't function too well mathematically I tend 
to go for scifi. Action movies are so damn boring.

I had a peek at the series 
[Silo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)).

That affords a chance to rant about use of gold tokens as currency. 
Same stupidity depicted in the Star Wars spin-off series 
[Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)).

Why? I mean... just... why?

In an undergroudn unker silo with probably a hundred thousand citizens, why on 
Earth, or under Earth, would they use a physical gold token as currency?

* Why not a ledger book?
* Why not their computers (which look like old Macintosh's. LOL)?
* Why not a stamped labour certificate?

... all of which would be cheaper and more efficient and less theft prone than 
gold frickin' tokens.

The goldbug mind virus runs deep.

## Why Hollywood? Why?

Hollywood script writers are not to blame. They only reflect popular culture.
When Netflix and film scriptwriters start using accounting ledgers for 
"the money" then MMT will have been victorious.  I do not see any signs of 
victory near.

It is laughable though in the context of [Silo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)).
because unlike the Star Wars series Andor, the incentive in the Silo would be 
to make the currency as cheap to move around as possible, and that would be via 
ledger book entries on computers.
