Had a comment on 
[this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frcMEdRk5AQ)
about 
[space exploration resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frcMEdRk5AQ)


> @8:50 The economic barriers are not what you think, if what you mean is 
"financing". For government projects the constraint is the real resource 
availability, not monetary. Sovereign governments (so those outside the EMU) 
issue their own currencies by fiat. Tax liabilities drive *_demand_* for the 
(otherwise worthless) currency, not supply of the currency for the issuer. Tax 
return (or "revenue" from the French. "revenir" ~ "to return back") is a 
redemption operation, not a funding operation. Government are resource 
constrained, they are not currency constrained. They are also falsely 
constrained by political psychology (fear of inflation or "debt to China" --- 
both of which are enormous epic tragic myths... which have prevented 
neoliberal governments especially from investing in public purpose.)

Having said that, I am not in favour of space exploration for now. We need 
to safeguard the beautiful blue-green-brown planet first.
