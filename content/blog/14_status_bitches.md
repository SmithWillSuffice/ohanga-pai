Interesting conversation Bill Mitchell had with a Japanese econmics "professor" (professes to know some economics).

I made a few notes, not too many.

## Japan SLips in GDP/Per Capita Ranking ---- so what?

The "professor" harped on a bit about how Japan had a "lost decade".  Bill explained 
well that it's hard to see in Japan any real loss of output. Their population growth 
is stagnant, so their GDP growth rate will not be anything near to say Australia 
which has a faster growing population.

Te "professor" then pulled up (livestream! so kudos!) some data showing the GDP/N 
rankings. Japan, he said, had "slipped dramatically" over the 00's.
Bill (and me) are like,.. "big deal, so what?"

This is half-joking, because you know what it's a big deal. Japanese culture suffers 
from as much inferiority complex as USA sports culture, they have the be the gdamn 
best... otherwise it's not a real sport. Only the Japanese suffer the inferiority 
complex more than others in industrial economics measures. They have a culture of 
needing to produce the best products. They'll get miffed if the Germans do something 
better. (Not to be stereotyping whole cultures, just telling it like I sometimes see 
it.)

I was reminded also of the research by Trill van Treeck on why Keynes' vision of a 15 
hour work week by 2000 has not been realized. The main reason is the psychology of 
conspicuous consumption. People wanting to "keep up with the Jones'". You can also 
call it The Rat Race.

Worrying about _relative_ status is a b*tch. Note how sociologist Till van Treeck 
explains why Keynes' vision of a 15 hour work week is possible but has not 
actualized here:

The wealthy nations caught Veblenitis, aka affluenza, aka ratraceitis.
