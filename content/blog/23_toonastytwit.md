Lately I've been becoming more resigned to the fact posts to Mastodon, Diaspora and 
Twitter are more about cheering the gang rather than getting people to think of 
updating their 
[brain-based Bayesian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function).${}^\ast$

With this in mind, I'm going to post a few things here that I feel would just make 
enemies on social media, more than friends. Also, it's light-hearted, and just to 
let off steam. Putting these posts on the github is a minimal act of sharing for 
those who care for a laugh. (All my laughs serve serious ends, I should add.)

${}^\ast$For the AI nerds, it is not the case our brains are Bayesian machines. 
Rather, a Bayesian update model captures some input--output behavioural aspects of 
animal brain cognition. Think of it being like how a Least Action Principle (so 
knowing future boundary conditions) is an effective description of physics, whereas 
the actual physics is Hamiltonian (infinitesimal local transformations). ((Or the 
other way around! ;-))

## Libertarians and Socialists

**New Definitions:** A libertarian is someone who puts socialists in harms way to 
protect their freedoms.

A socialist is someone who gets libertarians to do all their hacking for them. 
Also, a socialist is someone who doesn't understand anything about being sociable 
(though to be fair, that's probably only the case under something like capitalism).

A capitalist is someone who doesn't understand anything about markets and monopolies, 
but an awful lot about relative prices.

A neoliberal is someone who doesn't understand anything about anything, except 
what's in their current privatized thought.

A leftiepol is someone who recognizes unity is critical, and who denies it for 
themselves with other lefties in order to keep the actually unified right-wingers 
alive as the enemy.${}^\dagger$

${}^\dagger$This is also called the Reverse Robin Principle. See 
[“The Reactionary Mind”](https://coreyrobin.com/the-reactionary-mind/) 
by Cory Robin. (Conservatives *always* need something to complain about, and will 
invent it if lefties don't give it to them.)

A right-wingnut is someone who utterly hates the idea of solidarity and unity but 
is utterly effective in being unified and 100% in solidarity with other wingnuts.


## MMT and It's Discontents

MMT is too useful to be used (by idiots).${}\ddagger$

${}\ddagger$See the recent 
[cringe-worthy interview Jon Stewart televised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruMj0u6kSD8) 
with Larry ’the dollar pervert’ Summers. Quotable: "Corporations don't just suddenly 
become greedy." --- That was Summers' brain melting when Stewart pointed most of the 
recent CPI rise is from price gouging. (Not actually inflation, Mr Stewart, until 
wages get back up.)

MMT is in fact being used (by idiots). (This one is for the Austrians, just so they 
know what we know.)

Put the above together and we have MMT is too useful to be used by ‘X’, yet is used 
by ‘X’, and the result is endless wars, pointless state surveillance, mass 
involuntary unemployment, and a continual rise in the price level. All these things 
MMT gives you!

I realise this is terrible political framing. The reality is the MMT system currently 
in existence and used unwittingly by the idiots (neocons and neoliberals) to 
disproportionately enrich people who are already wealthy, is at least providing the 
poor with state welfare safety nets with little inflation pressure. The problem is, 
things could be so much better if the idiots understood the MMT system. I do believe 
not all the idiots *want* to be cruel. But that's just my optimism shinning through. 
Glass half full stuff.

The main point all the MMT activists are making is that it is only lack of political 
will that prevents an MMT system being run by kind and compassionate folks who will 
then know how to eliminate dire poverty and bring about full employment with price 
stability. (What everyone, not just women, at a minimum want.)

The other point is that for there to be the political will there seems to be a need 
for the knowledge of MMT.  This is a hard truth, bitter to swallow. In the USA, and 
most other developed nations, you are not going to get leftist socialists in 
government on the short-term horizon. So you need to educate the idiot neoliberals.

A well-educated neoliberal is no longer a neoliberal.

A well-credentialed neoliberal is a dangerous beast to be confined to Zoom room 
cages.

For this, it is worth recognizing most neoliberals do not want to be neoliberals They 
are neoliberals (austerity and privatization whores) because they are stupid and do 
not understand the monetary system is a simple public monopoly.

((At least that's my working thesis. Innocent until proven frauds. But like twitter 
buddy CarlitosMMT, I think there is a non-relativistic time clock running down on 
this: the longer MMT awareness invades public thought, the less tenable it is to 
maintain mere ignorance. ))



## From the "Could Not Be" $\rightarrow$ "Should Not Be" Department

MMT gives you the "why it could not be" reason.


## Moochers and Smoochers

The most regressive thing you hear in macroeconomics is the idea social welfare 
recipients are somehow "moochers". Feeding off the tax-payer. The exact opposite is 
the case in an MMT analysis. 

Welfare recipients are paying the price (lost wages) for "fighting inflation." 
However, it's worse. Consider the case of a parent who retires from work to care for 
a disabled child, giving the child a decent life. In this case the parent is (in cool 
terms) a service provider, supporting the rest of society by spending all their 
income.

The welfare recipients are (one of) the *providers* of currency to the other tax 
payers.

You simply cannot say the tax-payer is funding the welfare recipients. I know some 
MMT aware types claim the government uses the budget to make it *seem as so* the 
tax-payer is funding the welfare payments. After-all, that's the social discourse 
even on *soi dissant* "progressive" shows like The Majority Report. But this is not 
the fault of those living on social welfare. You blame the government in this case 
for not comprehending MMT. So there are still no such things as welfare moochers. 
It's an inapplicable notion.

But are there any actual moochers?

What about bullsh$\ast$t job employees? What about people who already have money who 
earn interest-income in proportion to how much money they already have? What about 
investors who invest in anything that moves without regard to the ecological 
consequences (so purely for a financial return)?


## All Economics Reduces to Physics

(I am only joking. But seriously.)

Physics (our accounting for physical reality, not the noumena themselves${}^\sharp$) 
can always be formulated as an energy minimization principle. Energy is the cost 
of doing physics (moving about).

What is economics but behaviour seeking to minimize some generalized "cost" function?

OK, but life is much more than this, because out-of-equilibrium events happen all 
over the place, fluctuations where a system (especially a subjectively conscious 
system) will seek to actively increase it's cost function to reduce others. Altruism. 
Cooperation. Kindness.

The latter fluctuations, which can occur all over the show, are what orthodox 
economics ignores. This is why orthodox economics is not only stupid, it's a 
hazard to human life. Most economists need to be locked up in cages in zoo's.


${}^\sharp$The physical noumena obey laws we might be fortunate to discover, but no 
scientist has any idea how or why physical matter obeys the laws we observe.
