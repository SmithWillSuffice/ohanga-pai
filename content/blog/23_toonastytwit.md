Lately I've been becoming more resigned to the fact posts to Mastodon, Diaspora and 
Twitter are more about cheering the gang rather than getting people to think of 
updating their 
[brain-based Bayesian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function).${}^\ast$

With this in mind, I'm going to post a few things here that I feel would just make 
enemies on social media, more than friends. Also, it's light-hearted, and just to 
let off steam. Putting these posts on the github is a minimal act of shring for those 
who care for a laugh.

${}^\ast$For the AI nerds, it is not the case our brains are Bayesian machines. 
Rather, a Bayesian update model captures some input--output behavioural aspect of our 
animal brain cognition. Think of it being like how a Least Action Principle (so 
knowing future boundary conditions) is an effective description of physics, whereas 
the actual physics is Hamiltonian (infinitesimal local transformations). ((Or the 
other way around! ;-))

## Libertarians and Socialists

**New Definitions:** A libertarian is someone who puts socialists in harms way to 
protect their freedoms.

A socialist is someone who gets libertarians to do all their hacking for them. 
Also, a socialist is someone who doesn't understand anything about being sociable 
(though to be fair, that's probably only the case under something like capitalism).

A capitalist is someone who doesn't understand anything about markets.

A neoliberal is someone who doesn't understand anything about anything, except 
what's in their current privatized thought.

A leftiepol is someone who recognizes unity is critical, and who denies it for 
themselves with other lefties in order to keep the actually unified right-wingers 
alive as the enemy.

A right-wingnut is someone who utterly hates the idea of solidarity and unity but is 
effective in being unified and 100% in solidarity with other wingnuts.
