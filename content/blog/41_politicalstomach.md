Reading a piece by Dougald Lamont here: 
[“The Great Deception”](https://dougaldlamont.substack.com/p/the-great-deception-chapter-6-how)
about 20th century Canadian fascist fake-socialist politics and Tommy Douglas.
Pretty fascinating.

My comments?  I'll be brief.

## When "Politics" Sickens Us

When the word "socialism" gets associated with so-called "Christian socialism" 
(disguising fascism, they're neither Christian nor socialists) you get that sick 
feeling in your gut about "all politics".
it's hard to avoid. But you have to avoid it.

Yes, by nature, economics and politics are sickening in both academic profession 
sphere and practical sphere. Everyone gets corrupted. Economics because it is 
where the policy power mostly resides.  Politics because the politicians are 
inevitably typically feeble and followers, less iconoclasts and more egotistical 
people, attracted to power. Very few politicians are genuine leaders, they 
follow the egg-head economists advice and the lobbyists, which is "where the 
money comes from" (MMT/MMM${}^\ast$ folks can laugh, and I do, followed by a 
grimace, because it's not a laughing matter).

Idiots who should know better by simple moral and ethical thinking succumb to 
gross mainstream economics paradigms of n(needless) austerity (the, "We've run 
out of scorepoints..." stuff, disguised disgustingly as, "We've run out of 
money...".)

${}^\ast$MMM = Modern Money Mechanics (the framework formerly known as MMT).

## Yet Politics Should Not Sicken Us

Let's face it, we are living through an era of extreme adolescence in politics 
and world affairs, past ages cannot rival us because of global reach, global 
networks, and magnification of ideological groupthink
(q..v. Mitchell and Fazi 
[“Eurozone Groupthink”](http://wer.worldeconomicsassociation.org/files/WEA-WER-7-Mitchell.pdf)

However, politics is the art of governance, and so is a pretty critical field of 
human endeavour. It must be suffused with spiritual impulses and virtues, it 
must be morally and ethically driven.  The fact it is not is, more or less, 
precisely what sickens us.  You don't really get sickened by corruption and 
violence within a crime family or syndicate, you expect it, and you steer clear 
of it.  It is where corruption and greed and violence appear where they are 
least appreciated is what really sickens us.

In a better world, with more spiritual as opposed to (or complimentary to) 
technical education, we might have a less corrupt and less greed-driven 
politics. Politics, proper, should not sicken us, but attract us. The impulse 
to do good. It drives a lot of good people into politics even when established 
politics is full of the dirty games and shear corruption and propaganda that 
Lamont writes about.

Thus, not only should better public good policy be our objective, we also need 
to work hard on finding ways to make our politics less corrupt, and so more 
attractive to good and kind-hearted people. It is one of the biggest social 
issues of our age. It has always been, for every age past and present, but 
the difference today, perhaps, is that we can see ways to finally overcome greed 
and corruption. Modern Money Mechanics or MMM (the framework formerly known as 
MMT) is one massive aspect of this, a factual aspect. It needs to be 
complemented by spiritual virtues and impulses (which I find it often is, as a 
movement beyond the academia).


## Innoculation Against the Disgust

I can think of a few remedies, but one is that thinking morally and ethically we 
simply cannot conscionably allow politics to be overrun by the fascists and 
neoliberals and their ilk. Although we may fail to make a lot of progress in our 
own lifetimes, it is still incumbent upon us all to at least fight against the 
ingrained right-wing establishment. And this includes an awful lot of so-called 
"left-wing centrism" --- it is, like "christian socialism" a mislabelling. There 
are no left-wing centrists these days, they're all using the "fiscal 
conservative" right-wing economics paradigm.  It is disgusting. But that is why 
we all have to fight to clean it out. Get rid of the rot. And personally I find 
no better antidote than education.

Education is a very slow inoculation against political rot however. But I see it 
as the ultimate sure path. Being opposed to violence except in defence of 
innocents.

That clause is important. Plenty of poor families and working class grunts are 
defenceless innocents in a class war. Some violence to defend them is called 
for. A good ethical use of violence is aggressive education! Do not let schools 
teach the mainstream economics rot, especially the macroeconomics and political 
economy rubbish inherited from 19th Century idiots (who nevertheless wrote 
nicely and were doing the best they thought they could--- they are only idiots 
relative to our capacity given our more substantial intellectual heritage.).

Fight the idiocy, and educate, to inoculate normal everyday people from 
ignorance. (Yes, I must acknowledge Neil Postman here, thanks dude).
