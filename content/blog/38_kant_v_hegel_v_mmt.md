Life has been friggin' traumatic for me recently, so excuse the low rate of 
blog output.  Today I'm noting down a few thoughts after listening to 
Grumbine's recent guest, Carlos García Hernández, on a topic he names 
[“Fiat Socialism”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk96zEm6mJ0) --- a bit of 
a Frankenstein phrase if you ask me, which is what I'll begin with, before 
getting into more juicy bits.

## Language Framing

I might make this language framing section a new regular feature of all my 
posts. Seems to be pretty important and a regular need for an autistic person 
like myself to harp on about endlessly.

When you google "fiat socialism" you will probably get a whole pile of garbage 
from von Mises and whoever, all libertarian Mont Pelerin + Austrian Schoolkid 
nonsense.

So, dudes, maybe choose better titles for you work that pay well with Search 
Engine Optimization? Not that I'm a keen student of SEO, but at least you want 
hits that populate user browsers with like-minded content?  I would think? 

But hey, maybe it serves a purpose to be more provocative and get into the 
enemy radars? That's all I'll say on the language.
