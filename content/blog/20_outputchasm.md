Last post I wrote about the way the euroland is ponzi, which came from Warren Mosler at 
the [MMT Fiscal Sustainability Conference 2010](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvPLZsgEcXSbdqMUTc-4usIO-9f0xBlc), but that also led me to 
[Bill Mitchell\'s incredibly powerful statements](https://youtu.be/hTWEFKH144M?t=1827) 
on the massive costs of unemployment. The latter is what I want to focus more on 
today.  I think it's the single most important topic in macroeconomics. And second 
only in *political* economy to the issue of lasting world peace.


## The Output Gap

The output gap is defined as the difference between real GDP produced in a given year 
and the potential maximum GDP that *could* have been produces had all available 
resources been fully employed.

Notice a problem with that definition?

It implies slavery of some description. So we'd better fix it. We do not really want 
to estimate the "maximum potential GDP' but rather the *optimal* level of GDP form 
full resource employment.  Now what does that mean? Well, there are at least two 
problems with maximisation as compared to optimization (maybe more than two):

1. We do not want nominal GDP to be the measure, it has to be real GDP, and that also 
means we should want to count only non-bullsh*t jobs.
2. Human well-being should *also* be optimized, which is not factored in any way in the 
NIPA accounting, so we cannot just maximise output, since that will entail some sort of 
wage slavery at the very least. We do not want optimal GDP to include any wage slavery 
(coercive or brutal work conditions).


On point 1: if useless products are sold, and that gets counted as real GDP, we're 
not doing the NIPA accounts justice. We do want to count all the sh*t jobs. Those are 
necessary jobs someone has to do, which are generally considered unpleasant.

Bullsh*t jobs (as [identified by David Graeber](https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant/)) 
may or may not be pleasant work 
conditions, but are typically associated with spiritual violence ("I hate my job") and 
are jobs understood, usually by the worker, to be unnecessary for a decent human 
civilization.

On point 2: because human well-being is subjective, it is hard to quantify optimal potential GDP. We really should use some other metrics. But failing that, we can 
"do a Kenyes" and for now take the recent past as the best guide to the present.
Although that's going to be conservative and regressive, it could also be considered 
a fair baseline, because the greater the well-being of workers usually the more productive and less bullsh*t the work. So a reactionary conservative psture (the recent past) will likely under-estimate the output gap.

That is ok for our purposes, because all we need to show is that the estimated
conservative output gap is still an horrific waste of human lives, a veritable crime against humanity (or should be thought of as so).
