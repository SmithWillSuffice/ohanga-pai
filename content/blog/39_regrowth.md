Comments on a recent Macro'n'Cheese podcast :
[“Degrowth and MMT” with Christopher Olk and Colleen Schneider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqiFX3MVtGo). This is from a big Macro'n'Cheese fan. 
They've got a great library of podcasts.

## Regrowth is Based

While I absolutely unconditionally love my RealProgressives colleagues, the Degrowth meme and language framing is incrediubly dumb. I say this even 
though Bill Mitchell uses it (ok, he's not a genius).

Here were my comments on the youtube copy of the podcast (I refuse Facebook, 
so cannto comment on the original websites).


### On Degrowthism

Their research paper has a great opening sentence: _"Degrowth lacks a theory of how the state can finance ambitious social-ecological policies and public provisioning systems while maintaining macroeconomic stability during a reduction of economic activity."_ --- however, for us pure MMT activist scholars even this 
is weird language. You do not need a "theory" of how to finance when you 
have real resources you can employ to work on any problem. You just need to 
understand the currency is not a finite physical resource. But even degrowth 
MMT'ers get things wrong --- they still think nominal inflation is a real constraint, when it is not${}^\dagger$ , it is a political psychology 
constraint, and part of the MMT activist effort needs to be overcoming 
this *_final prejudice._* Which means understanding what a currency gauge is, 
and how to use a gauge as a tool for promoting economic justice.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${}^\dagger$ (Unless the CIA hitmen knock on your door with a silly letter from the IMF, that while silly can nevertheless seriously endanger your people, but no worse so than economic injustice.)

I added:

> Yeah yeah SteveG, I know you'll say "degrowth" is flames in their face or 
too their feet. But there's a limit to what normies can tolerate, and 
eventually it becomes counter-productive for real progressives. Normies, 
like it or not, are not the brightest sparks. But they are the mass we 
need to move.


## On "The Periphery"

Referring to Olk and Schenider's 
[recent paper with Jason Hickel](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107968):

> Note also in their paper they use Kaboub for "addressing" the "sovereignty" 
challenges facing peripheral nations. This is bone-headed and wrong. Their 
paragraph is 
*"... They ((Kaboub et al)) recommend interest rate targeting by peripheral central banks, floating exchange rates, and industrial policy for food and energy sovereignty, alongside calling for de-colonial reparations and the abolition of illegitimate debts to increase monetary sovereignty,..."*
--- first, you do not want interest rate targeting, you want ZIRP for 
maximum policy space. Second, the monetary policy aught be no constraint at 
all, it is not even an inflation constraint, provided the lower real wage 
rises faster or no slower than the highest real wage, because then the 
trajectory is for justice and greater equality.  Third, the only true 
constraint facing a peripheral nation government that has an army and tax 
department and understand MMT, is a foreign coup or soft power actor like 
the USA.  That is not an MMT problem. It is a UN problem, and the UN must 
address it with proper global collective security, not provincial NATO 
collective insecurity.

### Regrowthism is not an -ism

Last comment for today, I commented on myself over on substack, the remark 
was thus:

I had a recent comment or two to make on Degrowthism, I think it is time, 
for the sake of better appeal to normies (who realistically we are going to 
have to carry, it cannot be avoided) to drop the inflammatory “degrowth” meme 
and rhetoric, and adopt the more realistic and pragmatic Regrowth narrative. 
Is there even such a  narrative? Well, it’d be super easy to make one, just 
get Hickel and Raworth and everyone to rewrite all their books and 
papers replacing “degrowth” with “regrowth”. That’s even a recipe for 
easily doubling-up your publications yo’.

Because the natural world, to a realist, is rich with processes of life 
and death, growth and decay, form and chaos, it is entirely natural (in 
the deepest sense) to have social discourse about regrowth. It is thus no 
"-ism". It's the real deal.
