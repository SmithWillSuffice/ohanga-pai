A slightly younger Warren Mosler today, but like choice wine his past 
appearances age well. (Intellectual wine for me, I don't drink intoxicants 
except coffee. Healthy body, healthy mind, and all that.)
[Mosler at the Berkely Forum c.2022.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGoT_A5fqc)

This aged Mosler goes down well, but the youtube comments section is 
something I hardly ever get to read, since I'm typically too early to see 
critics, or far too late to be bothered.  But for this one I had a few 
comments to make.


## Myth of Barter

Good ol' "Rob" inserts his usual simplistic critique of MMT. He points out,
for the case of pre-colonial Africa, Mosler is saying there was a non-monetary 
economy, until the British came in to force the natives to grow coffee by 
imposing coercive tax liabilities --- the infamous and downright cruel Hut Tax.

Rob claims Mosler is being contradictory with Randall Wray, since Wray 
insists there were never pure barter economies. The thing is, both Mosler 
and Wray are correct. It is far too simplistic to say barter equals 
"non-monetary". It's a logical subset fallacy: the "non-monetary" is a far 
larger category than "barter" --- when we define "money" in very specific 
terms, to with **_state tax credits_**.

With a broader definition of "money" then a barter economy can be seen to be 
a monetary economy. Just not using a tax credit. But to the extent such a 
small economy is using a type of account record, it is not pure barter.
In pure barter you cannot put anything "on credit".  Where can you find such 
economies? They are rare, and tend to be village level in size, everyone 
knows everyone else, meaning little need for account records.

My counter:
> Note that "barter" vs "non-monetary" are two different things, there is 
overlap, but not perfect coincidence. No large scale economies have ever 
been barter, it is too inefficient and people know it instinctively, there 
are thus always accounting records (records of who owes whom what) and 
technically that _is_ a monetary system, but not in the sense Mosler talks 
about. Mosler is talking specifically about a fiat currency driven by 
coercive tax liabilities, not just accounting records. But in a simple 
economy with a large number of people who cannot afford to trust each other 
blindly, there will be accounting records, and that _is_ "the money". Never 
pure barter. A few households can run pure barter, but not more than a few 
thousand.


## Governments are "implementing MMT"??

This is a giant "WTF!" One youtube poster was essentially blaming "MMT" for 
all the ills of today's inflations, etc., the usual straw-man attack on MMT.

My counter:
> No government is implementing MMT recommended policy (ZIRP, JG, eliminate 
payroll tax and VAT/GST), but _all governments_ outside the EMU have an MMT 
operations system. You cannot legitimately criticize MMT for politicians who 
do not understand their own currency system, MMT activists have been 
struggling for decades trying to get politicians to understand, and they 
either do and refuse to admit it, or choose to be ignorant for their own 
political purposes. As Phil Waller, and a few others, remarked: where is 
the country implementing a Job Guarantee? Not even "MMT Japan" is 
implementing.

The interesting thing here is that tax return is often considered 
deflationary, but demand withdrawal, but that's a slight myth. Tax liabilities 
drive the demand, tax returns withdraw demand, but do not immediately alter 
prices. Firm have to actively reduce prices to clear sales, but they tend not 
too, especially these days with credit cards all around. It might be a whole 
different story of not for credit cards and overdraughts, in fact 
it _would be_ totally different. But as things stand today, tax return does 
not actively lower the price level, it can prevent the prices from going up 
too fast.  Tax drains certainly tend to suppress the stock market for a week 
or so --- hardly a catastrophe for the real economy.

The _more_ interesting thing is the vast free-up in real terms when payroll 
and GST taxes are eliminated. Mosler estimates it would free up around 10% of 
GDP, maybe more.  Governments seem to have no clue about this, 
and probably do not know the massive amount of wasted human lives spent on 
needless tax compliance. Eliminating GST and payroll taxes would likely be 
inflation neutral in the mid-term, since although increasing effective 
demand, it frees up a huge amount of human labour hours to do better things.
What is demanded when GST and payroll taxes are dropped to 0% rate would be 
an offset fiscal policy to employ the newly unemployed.

We could call that a Job Guarantee, but really there is no good reason to 
use the JG this way, it is an abuse. The proper thing to do would be to 
employ all those unemployed tax lawyers and accountants for the public 
purpose in skilled work --- if they want it --- say in investigating 
financial fraud, or helping out at the local school or orphanage --- teaching 
MMT of course! ;-)

## Inflation Fear-mongering

The usual critics appear blaming MMT for inflation. At this point in history 
I am almost prepared to ignore them, they've become total idiots. A few years 
ago maybe they were excusable, since MMT was largely unknown, but there is 
no excuse today, you can get models that are mainstream/IS_LM/DSGE and models 
that are more MMT-like, and compare. The mainstream models are just plain 
wrong, on the empirical evidence.  Douglas and the boys over at AppliedMMT 
are trading in almost a naïve way, which should not work at all, but they 
make winning trades, because they're using the MMT lens.

The main comment to make on inflation (defined as the 
term structure of prices faced by consumers today):
> Nominal inflation is never an economic problem, it is a psychological 
problem (gets you voted out of office sometimes). Real inflation is the 
killer for the low income households. (But that is not new in MMT, it's 
just obvious.)

Note that when we talk about the _term structure of prices_ then that is a 
rate of change measure, the time period is the denominator. Or at least that 
is implicit. Look at a table of the term structure, divide the price 
differences by the time interval, and you roughly get an inflation forecast.

You cannot look backwards and say the reported CPI or PCE (personal 
consumption expenditures). Even 
[this article here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci3-6.html) kinda' gets it wrong, you 
can take CPI as a good measure, for _past changes in the price level_. What 
does CPI tell you about the **_current_** rate of inflation though? Next to 
nothing. Why?

It is because active government policy is needed to sustain inflation. 
Inflation is not a natural phenomenon. If anything deflation is slightly more 
natural due to more or less continual productivity gains due to improved 
technology. Off-setting this is rampant consumerism and greed, of course. 
Another bias for pro-inflation is demand from the lower paid for better 
equity, and when that is the inflation driver then it is a good thing, not 
to be complained about.

I guess you can say human greed is "natural" but I don't. We are not greedy 
inherently. We are not ruled deterministically by selfish genes.  Tonnes of 
artificial incentives and artificial scarcity make us greedy and artificially 
competitive, primarily the excessive tax burden, which MMT claims is overkill.


## Eliminate the Stock Market Casino

The DemystifySci hosts asked about "money going into the stock market if 
bonds were eliminated (or zirp)." It reminded me of Mosler's proposal for 
stocks: set a price cap at $20 per, and the companies can then just issue 
more. Eliminate the "casino".  I checked in with Warren to ask him about 
this proposal and if he had any revisions. He replied as courteously as usual:

**Answer:** Yes, new issues come at $\text{\small \\$}$10, and the company is required to 
issue unlimited shares for sale at $\text{\small \\$}$20.

I had a few related follow-ups, and Warren was generous to reply:

**Question:** how could you see a government implementing this practically 
in a transition period?  
**Answer:** Immediately subject all new issues to this requirement. 
Immediately require all existing listed companies to offer unlimited shares 
for sale at a price maybe 25% above the latest closing market price. 


**Question:** I do not know how the exchanges are organized, but in most 
countries there is something like the SEC, right, so they'd just dictate 
the new terms coming from government direction/statutes?   
**Answer:** Corporations have charters that subject them to gov reg.s in 
exchange for limited liability. They can go back to partnerships and sole 
proprietorships any time and lose gov granted limited liability.


**Question:** Did you have any idea for how to make such a transition 
least disruptive?  
**Answer:**  As above, but open to suggestions.   
Say: for existing shares on the new day=1 the price goes straight to the 
last closing price + 25%, as above.
