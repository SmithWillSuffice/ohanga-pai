A slightly younger Warren Mosler today, but like choice wine. (Intellectual 
wine for me, I don't drink intoxicants except coffee. Healthy body, healthy 
mind, and all that.)
[Mosler at the Berkely Forum c.2022.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGoT_A5fqc)

This aged Mosler goes down well, but the youtube comments section is 
something I hardly ever get to read, since I'm typically too early to see 
critics, or far too late to be bothered.  But for this one I had a few 
comments to make.


## Myth of Barter

Good ol' "Rob" inserts his usual simplistic critique of MMT. He points out in 
pre-colonial Africa Mosler is saying there was a non-monetary economy, until 
the British came in to force the natives to grow coffee by imposing coercive 
tax liabilities --- the infamous and downright cruel Hut Tax.

Rob claims Mosler is being contradictory with Randall Wray, since Wray 
insists there were never pure barter economies. The thing is, both Mosler 
and Wray are correct. It is far too simplistic to say barter equals 
"non-monetary". It's a logical subset fallacy: the "non-monetary" is a far 
larger category than "barter" --- when we define "money" in very specific 
terms, to with **_state tax credits**.

With a broader definition of "money" then a barter economy can be seen to be 
a monetary economy. Just not using a tax credit. But to the extent such a 
small economy is using a type of account record, it is not pure barter.
In pure barter you cannot put anything "on credit".  Where can you find such economies? They are rare, and tend to be village level in size, everyone 
knows everyone else, meaning little need for account records.

My counter:
> Note that "barter" vs "non-monetary" are two different things, there is 
overlap, but not perfect coincidence. No large scale economies have ever 
been barter, it is too inefficient and people know it instinctively, there 
are thus always accounting records (records of who owes whom what) and 
technically that _is_ a monetary system, but not in the sense Mosler talks 
about. Mosler is talking specifically about a fiat currency driven by 
coercive tax liabilities, not just accounting records. But in a simple 
economy with a large number of people who cannot afford to trust each other 
blindly, there will be accounting records, and that _is_ "the money". Never 
pure barter. A few households can run pure barter, but not more than a few 
thousand.


## Governments _are_ "implementing MMT"??

This is a giant "WFT!" One youtube poster was essentially blaming "MMT" for 
all the ills of today's inflations, tc., the usual straw-man attack on MMT.

My counter:
> No government is implementing MMT recommended policy (ZIRP, JG, eliminate 
payroll tax and VAT/GST), but _all governments_ outside the EMU have an MMT 
operations system. You cannot legitimately criticize MMT for politicians who 
do not understand their own currency system, MMT activists have been 
struggling for decades trying to get politicians to understand, and they 
either do and refuse to admit it, or choose to be ignorant for their own 
political purposes. 


## Inflation Fear-mongering

The usual critics appear blaming MMT for inflation. At this point in history 
I am almost prepared to ignore them, they've become total idiots. A few years 
ago maybe they were excusable, since MMT was largely unknown, but there is 
no excuse today, you can get models that are mainstream/IS_LM/DSGE and models 
that are more MMT-like, and compare. The mainstream models are just plain 
wrong, on the empirical evidence.  Douglas and the boys over at AppliedMMT 
are trading in almost a naÃ¯ve way, which should not work at all, but they 
make winning trades, because they're using the MMT lens.

The main comment to make on inflation (defined as the 
term structure of prices faced by consumers today):
> Nominal inflation is never an economic problem, it is a psychological 
problem (gets you voted out of office sometimes). Real inflation is the 
killer for the low income households. (But that is not new in MMT, it's 
just obvious.)

Note that when we talk about the _term structure of prices_ then that is a 
rate of change measure, the time period is the denominator. Or at least that 
is implicit. Look at a table of the term structure, divide the price 
differences by the time interval, and you roughly get an inflation forecast.

You cannot look backwards and say the reported CPI or PCE (personal 
consumption expenditures). Even 
[this article here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci3-6.html) kinda' gets it wrong, you 
can take CPI as a good measure, for past changes in the price level. What 
does CPI tell you about the **_current_** rate of inflation though? Next to 
nothing. Why?

It is because active government policy is needed to sustain inflation. 
Inflation is not a natural phenomenon. If anything deflation is slightly more 
natural due to more or less continual productivity gains due to improved 
technology. Off-setting this is rampant consumerism and greed, of course. 
Another bias for pro-inflation is demands of the lower paid for better 
equity, and when that is the inflation driver then it is a good thing, not 
to be complained about.

I guess you can say human greed is "natural" but I don't. We are not greedy 
inherently. Tonnes of artificial incentives and artificial scarcity make us 
greedy, primarily the excessive tax burden, which MMMT claims is overkill.
