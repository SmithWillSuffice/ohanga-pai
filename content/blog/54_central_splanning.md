How one thing leads to another, huh? After a long gap between Ōhanga Pai 
posts I have two in short succession. This one could turn out juicier, since 
it is a complex topic. The occasion is coming across a Santa Fe Institute 
public talk on central planning:
[“Comrades, Let’s Optimize! The Surprising Rebirth of the Planned Economy”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Hghul4oEI) at SFI, March 10. 
The guest speaker was Francis Spufford 
who wrote a book called [“Red Plenty”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18634818-red-plenty)

## Setting the Scene

I am pretty sure Spufford is getting a lot of things wrong. He reckons the 
Soviet Union was founded on a sort of communist fairy tale of the merits of a 
planned economy.

But as Michael Hudson will often point out, all economies are more or less 
centrally planned. The question is whether they are "centrally planned" 
nebulously by Wall Street (or your nation's equivalent) or the public via a 
representative democratic government, or via an autocracy.

The secondary question concerns what methods each form of government will 
employ. That makes a huge difference, if one of the goals is efficiency and 
minimum waste, then there are serious scientific questions to ask about which 
form of planning is the superior. I think it is fair to say economists do 
not truly know the answer.

Yet is aught to also be fair to say all economists should agree unemployment is 
a massive waste of real resources, and that any economic system tolerating 
unemployment is not the best one you could have.. Unfortunately, and this is 
truly crazy, it seems most mainstream orthodox economists are quite happy in 
thinking unemployment is *not* a waste, and is in (their) facts a necessity, 
for market efficiency.

Only MMT can truly point out why this is false. (The post-Keynesians never 
could make the argument against tolerating unemployment.)

Also, the fairy tale of the Soviets may have been a thing, a hoped for future 
many Soviets thought was realistic. But the (false) myth about this is that 
the Soviets were in fact communists. they were not. They never got even close 
to any form of socialism. From the Bolshevik get-go gun it was a hierarchical 
system, anti-democratic, ruled by a powerful committee of elites armed with a 
secrete police (and all the other police). Hence closer to Wall Street 
lobbyist controlled USA government than to say an extremely large kibbutzim 
or the like. 

The fairy tale was probably real in the minds of many Russians, but they were 
hopeless deluding themselves, or perhaps not, perhaps they innocently believed 
in the benevolence of the central committee, so were not to be faulted. Who 
doesn't want to believe their government is benevolent? (That's rhetorical, 
rugged individual libertarians who never had any parents need not answer.) 
Same as any child: you do not like learning your parents are stupid normal 
people with nothing special about them, except hopefully they love you nearly 
unconditionally.

((I am not invoking the false "government as household" analogy here, just an 
analogy about an internal power dynamic within a given system.))


# Initial Reactions

Maybe I won't get to the end of it, but forn starters here was my first 
reaction:
> Spufford really nerds out far too much. And the intro was wrong. When there 
is a monopoly issuer of a sovereign currency there is no "free market". There 
is a secondary market that is free enough to determine relative prices. But 
the macroeconomics price level can only come from one source, the government. 
Whether you like it or not. The monopolist has to either fix price (let supply 
float) or fix quantity (and let price fluctuate), or some mish-mash hybrid (out 
of sheer ignorance, which is the case today with all governments).  There is 
only one good choice for a macroeconomy, which is to fix price and allow 
supply to float, which means the government deficit float, and is not 
targeted. Instead full useful employment is targeted, using a job guarantee 
as a floor.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is, the monopoly currency issuer 
can always determine the price level, e.g., using the automatic stabilizers 
(progressive tax brackets for currency withdraw, job guarantee for base 
currency supply at a fixed price). Net government spending less tax return is 
the net financial wealth (in the state's unit of account) of the rest of the 
economy. At this macro level it is not a "complex system". It is a monopoly. 
It is complicated because of political psychology and inherent power dynamics 
controlling the monopoly, but it does not have to be either 100% planned nor 
100% anarchic. It's a political choice to have unemployment (massive waste of 
real resources, lost output that can never be recovered), the wrong choice.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the USA and most nations, we have 
oligarchy not because government is "weak" per se, nor because government is 
beholden to market forces, but rather more because the oligarchs control 
government. It does not have to be this way. And it does not have to be 
centrally planned either. If you understand the monetary system you can 
design any sort of social economy you desire. I'd suggest a proper democracy, 
with full employment in non-bs jobs, which is nowhere to be found.

I felt I had to follow-up:

> Any decent economist who understands dynamics (so is not enthralled by 
neoclassical equilibrium mush-brain thinking) and non-linearity will know why 
a job guarantee is not an inflation risk. Rising government net spending is 
also not inflationary if given a growing population. A growing population must 
have a growing money supply, otherwise there will be widespread bank credit 
issuance, which is a major instability without a mechanism for debt 
forgiveness (a debt that cannot be repaid is a credit that was fraudulently 
or ignorantly issued).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heated-up economy (in monetary 
circulation terms, not necessarily energy use) does not lead to nominal 
inflation if the higher circulation results *_automatically_* in higher 
tax redemption, which it almost always does, unless the rich have conned 
government into getting themselves zero tax rates and interest-income by 
the trillions. Mosler's 7th DIF: higher government deficits today can cause 
higher tax return tomorrow. This is not a myth, it is true, the myth is that 
it is a bad thing. The truth is it is a good thing. Higher tax returns (with 
no change in tax code) is a mere signal of a stronger economy. The tax return 
does not fund the government when the government is the original issuer of 
the currency by fiat. Tax return is a redemption operation, not a funding 
operation. Or, for the simple-minded: "Taxes do not finance government 
spending."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the imposition of tax liabilities 
that is import: this drives *_demand_* for an otherwise worthless token 
(scorepoints in bank accounts these days). A "money thing" is worthless unless 
it is redeemable. Governments have never defaulted on these redemptions, why 
would they refuse return of their own currency?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is they _might_ "refuse" in 
order to not withdraw too much currency from circulation, because they desire 
a strong economy!!  But this "refusal" could simply be lowering tax rates. 
(Yet in our times little do politicians know this is the reason to lower 
taxes.) Politicians who think taxes fund the government are essentially "evil" 
in the form of gross ignorance.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same with Treasury bonds. These are 
entirely pointless instruments when the currency is on a floating exchange 
rate. On a float there is simply no need for government to offer a risk-free 
savings asset. That's because when on a float the Government does not need 
to sell bonds to lock-up Its own currency for a term to stabilize the exchange 
rate, the exchange rate is floated! The function of selling bonds is to set a 
base interest rate. But this is nothing but 
*_basic income but only for people who already have money in proportion to how much money they already have._* So it is highly regressive. The stable policy is a 
zero interest rate, and ensure licensed banks can do *_nothing but_* assess 
credit worthiness and run the payments layer (so hold check accounts and term 
deposits), thus ensuring banks cannot issue fraudulent credit, and the market 
can determine the interest rate above the government base rate of zero.
    
But then, I thought, does that not say it all? What more is there to say about 
the myth of central planning and the myth of free markets?
    
Perhaps it is worth repeating --- but in a different style --- for emphasis:
