The pro-working class non-allied alliance has full spectrum dominance.
But who in far-off alien galactic civilizations observing us by radio 
emissions would know?

What does this mean?

## Full Spectral Dominance

No, it's not just a dumb physics pun humour. Although is is that too.

It means that if we disregard soft cultural values and religious 
preferences, so-called Identity politics, and the like,  then the number of 
people who broadly support workers is massive, and spreads across the entire 
political spectrum. That means from so-called left-wing to right-wing.

I know a lot of self-professed conservatives who are thoroughly pro-worker. 
In my mind these friends are not Tories. So right there you can tell where 
I am going to go today. The political spectrum portrayed in mainstream 
discourse is a sick impoverished cartoon joke.

We do not live politically in our consciousness on a 1D line more 
a 2D political compass map.

Just about the only anti-worker spectral fringes is the _extreme centre_ --- 
which I classify as extreme Neoliberal. They are extreme anti-worker and 
pro-managerial upper-class technocracy.

They'd be the ones supporting the Mars King if the Mars King had not 
gone full nazi salute and GOP tax-break and SCOTUS chasing.
I am using USA politics here as my piÃ±ata since my whanau will pounce on 
me if I get too involved in Kiwi partisan politics.

One needs strawmen or the like to make a crisp point sometimes.



## Indie Space

{{<political_spectra_a>}}

OK, but if you insist on a one-dimensional curve for a cartoon, then at 
least be minimally creative and been it a little.

We can go Triangle spectrum.

{{<political_spectra_b>}}

But this is still too weak.

What is the real political map?

The answer is that it is an abstraction that "lives" (so-to-speak) in a 
very high dimensional space of polices and preferences. Too numerous for 
one such as myself unschooled in the dark arts of 
pÌ¶oÌ¶lÌ¶iÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶aÌ¶lÌ¶ Ì¶sÌ¶cÌ¶iÌ¶eÌ¶nÌ¶cÌ¶eÌ¶ political alchemy
to enumerate.  Only since human language is finite we could say the 
dimensions are finite.  Thank goodness we do not have to battle to defend 
a Cantorian Continuum with the Normal Wildbergers.

In reality one person is all over this triangle space. Which means the 
interior is effective abstraction too (is realized in politics 
"on the street").  Just remember, here at Dirtbag MMT we regard everyone 
who has a say in policy, even if crying into the storm, to 
be "a politician".  Most people are political animals.

Have you ever had that hippie sort of friend who pretends they do not 
care, and the world is chaos, and you just gotta "live in the moment"? 
Yeah. Well that is _extreme politics_. And also not very good politics. 
It is worse than stupid... if you ask me. 

The real space of politics is more like this...

{{<political_ndim_space>}}

I call it "Political Indie Space". The "Indie" is a pun on $n$-D or 
$n$-dimensional.


## We are Fluid

Not only does a person not occupy a low-dimensional political space, but 
we are also moving about in this space. One of the biggest movers for me 
was learning MMT.

But before MMT, decades ago, I had learned macroeconomics is a complex 
dynamical system. The Sante Fe Institute, and nerds like John Blatt, 
had long ago provided all the evidence mainstream economics was thoroughly 
rotten. Sante Fe types however will still closed to the concept of the 
money being an IOU of the government. That had to await Mosler, Wray 
and Mitchell.

The lesson today is that all this tells you something about how to be 
politically a more effective activist.

You cannot operate effectively along all axis dimensions. Choose one 
or two.

The only one to choose in our currently political economic era (extreme 
neoliberal apex and techno-fascist rise era) is the one that is 
pro working class emancipation. Which means the goal is elimination 
of economic class. 

I realize this does not furnish you with the tools,, that'll come later, 
but suffice it to say one of the more powerful tools is knowing MMT.
An even more powerful tool, which is complementary to MMT, is to grow one's 
spiritual capacity, which in macroeconomic context means understanding 
the poorest people are our only true concern. If a brother or sister 
is in need, we do not let them suffer. Just now extend your concept of 
"brother and sister" to all humanity.  It is easy to do. You only need 
have an empathetic and caring soul.  Most people do.

What's that? You want a typed-up proof of this?ðŸ¤£  How about your 
eyeballs and ears?

And before this triggers any of you milquetoast liberals, this does not mean 
bland uniformity or eradication of differences. It just means elimination 
of _extremes_ of wealth and poverty. How extreme is too extreme though? 

There is no use placing a number on it. The definition of "too extreme" is 
that our wealthy countryfolk and foreign occupants are too powerful --- 
meaning they influence political decisions whenever they want to _more than 
you can whenever you want to_.

Too radical a definition?

I challenge you to come up with a better one that is manifest justice.
