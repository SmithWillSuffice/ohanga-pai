I've avoided clicking on Varoufakis' technofeudalism talks, but finally 
caved-in today. Man was I pissed. I mean, the basic thesis is ok, even 
interesting, probably mostly true, but when Yanis starts talking about 
government debt as a bad thing I loose my sh$\ast$t.

I'll spare the details and just link to the 
[talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xfFgFqEyfk).

My comments:

> @35:00 someone did not read much history. State debt has never caused a 
collapse of empire. A State's deficit is it's citizens surplus by accounting 
identity, it is a good thing (all else equal). What happens in empire collapse 
is either massive corruption or with monetary systems something like massive 
private debt, which means if the State is in deficit some oligarchs are 
holding an enormous amount of currency (equal to the private household debt 
plus the government deficit). These are only scorepoints though as far as the 
State is concerned, but the banking systems tend to be pretty rigid (by law), 
and if private debts of the poor, especially farmers, are not forgiven then 
you get revolt, you also get economic collapse. But it is not because of the 
debt of the sate (which is private surplus) it is because too much of that 
currency outstanding, not yet used to pay taxes, is held by too few who are 
hoarding and not spending.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gross inequality which is the instability, 
not the debt of the State. A state that issues it's own scorepoints is never 
broke and can always pay its debts --- in its own currency. (Cesar could have 
stamped the trillion aureus coin --- the metal value of the coin is not the 
face value. State currency has always been a scorekeeping system.) There is 
then inflation risk, but that never causes the collapse of a state, since you 
only get nominal currency inflation if you have a booming economy, or have 
something crippling supply like a famine, drought or war reparations imposed. 
It is surprising Yanis is using monetarist understanding, he has friendly 
MMT colleagues, but seems to not have learned much from them.

Then he talked about the trade imablance:
> @38:00 that is such bs. Australia has a sovereign currency and can run 
deficits too. You send away uranium and import smartphones and Teslas... if 
you are smart. The government deficit is irrelevant (except in political 
psychology), it is an _ex post_ accounting identity, and the bigger it is 
the wealthier your people, or if foreigners are holding more AUD then the 
more customers Aussie firms will have to sell to without the customer doing 
a forex swap. Yanis seems to be an imbecile when it comes to state currency 
operations.  The reason the USA gets away with a huge current account deficit 
is because foreigners are stupid and have an insatiable desire for holding USD. 
But is the desire for the amount of AUD held also insatiable? Sure it is, you 
cannot give me enough of your AUD. If I hold your AUD I am not causing any 
price inflation of AUD goods either. Give me a trillion AUD, I can still use 
more. If I rashly spend it all in a blitz I'm only harming my interest in you 
guys keeping your prices low.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like Yanis, but he can be such an idiot. It 
harms the working class to perpetuate the Deficit Myth, it kills the poor. 
It emboldens the wealthy "tax payer" --- who is not the entity funding the 
government. As Yanis just said before, it's the other way around (9 out or 
10 Musk/Bezos/Gates scorepoints cam from the government).


On the technofeudalism thesis I only had one comment:
> @16:00 at this point I do not know if Yanis will get around to it, but I'd 
also hypothesize techno-feudalism eats itself. You cannot stop tinkerers and 
hackers from removing those chips from the Tesla, or subverting Amazon, or 
establishing pirate communications, &c. Hackers need some time to do this, 
also freedom from prosecution, but eventually they will do it (whatever "it" 
is) if it becomes legal and is "cool" or "based". (Ironically Apple Inc 
through Wozniak demonstrated this a little, until Apple became greedy under 
S.&nbsp;Jobs.)

I do not enjoy writing critically of people like Varoufakis, Steve Keen or 
Michael Hudson. So if any readers think I've got something very wrong, please
