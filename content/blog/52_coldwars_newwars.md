I was listening to 
[Katrina van den Hueval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTBo3AAud-c) on one 
of Pascal's recent episodes over at 
[Neutrality Studies](https://www.youtube.com/@neutralitystudies).

Katrina mentioned how today the world's security against nuclear weapon 
deployment seems more precarious than during the Cold War. Although I have not 
dug deep into any statistics to validate the proposition, I tend to agree. 
But I had to post a comment:

> [@15:30](https://youtu.be/DTBo3AAud-c?t=935) while it is probably true our 
times are more unstable than the Cold War era, this is good${}^\ddagger$. When 
things are 
stable there is little change. What actually changed during the Cold War? 
Nations went from a mix of bastard Keynesianism to full on monetarist 
neoliberalism. In other words, political economy went backwards for the last 
four decades or more. The 70's inflations were not due to Keynesian policy 
(pure nor bastard forms) neither due all that much to the conflict between 
capital and labour (a very minor effect), but were due mostly to energy price 
shocks driven by a powerful monopoly cartel. The MMT crowd can explain, get 
them on the show, and when you get them on roast their nuts on why they are 
not more militant against neoliberalism and bourgeois complacency and 
nihilism. The rentiers have to be euthanized, they're not the wealth creators, 
workers are.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${}^\ddagger$A stable society is a good 
condition once you have a peaceful fair society. Not when you have a 
disgusting class based unjust society. Where you come from, the initial 
conditions, matters.

I know friends over at RP/RPiA and other MMT activist circles would agree 
with me. The "MMT crowd" I refer to above is the milquetoast normie 
MMT'er, the ones who think understanding the monetary system will fix things 
right.

That means **_not_** Bill Mitchell. See Bill's recent comments here:
[“Class, Capitalism and MMT”](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0BvYb9RqMbnItE2ReWHlOh?si=9dacaed4d8544389)

One thing should be said however, in defence of neutral MMT. Anyone who goes 
from not knowing MMT to knowing MMT is about 90% likely to be radicalized, to 
transform from a normie to a powerful progressive, not a milquetoast progressive 
(fake progressive). Knowledge *is* power. It's just not the only form of power.
A moral compass is needed too, otherwise power gets channelled in the wrong 
directions.
