TODO:
Had some thoughts about the Neoliberals and Fascism.
Old story of how the former becomes the latter.
New take on it?
```
Hey math geeks, did you know there’s a functor from Neoliberals to 
Fascists? For normies: yeah, it is called “a straight line”, or at worst 
a “Zebra crossing”. Highly technical stuff.

Hey film geeks, don’t be snowflakes, artistic interpretation is subjective. 
If you want to think of Neo as merely an abstract embodiment of all human 
knowledge and hacking ability, then he’s not a fascist, he’s a commie, or 
maybe an anarchist? De gustibus non est disputandum. 


One recent episode of 
[The Majority Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHe7shPDJ0).
The guest, Richard Seymour, had a generally reasonable report on fascism 
today in the USA.  
Fun stuff... not.

However, at one point he misspoke (I presume) and said the far-right in 
the USA are seeking a white majoritarian populace, so they can exploit 
good ol' democracy.

**Me:** "What's the matter whiteman, you no like tyranny of the 
minority anymore?"

I had to comment:
> No, [@11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHe7shPDJ0&t=690s) — they 
are certainly not advocating majoritarian democracy. 
That would be actual democracy. They want (or really just "need" since I'm 
sure some of them want the lot) "just enough" ethnic cleansing, so 
"ethnic rinsing," to _gain_ a majority, and more importantly they want 
political psychology indoctrination, so a majority will support neoliberal 
policies  even if they lack a majority (which they will lack, for sure, 
demographics!). These are "not yet fully fledged fascists" but that's 
a constraint of time. It takes time to indoctrinate people. Neoliberalism 
took decades. The Boomers do not remember *_how_*  they grew up in an era 
of economic prosperity (the "how" was due to barely above mediocre 
government support for labour).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they forget _that_ was a good era 
for society --- and would've been even better had the Cold War and 
colonial/slavery and sexist remnants been absent? They did not forget of 
course, most want "MAGA".  So what's the deal?   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal is they completely 
forgot what _caused_ half-decent economic prosperity: the cause 
was government support for labour and unions (milquetoast support, but still 
it was non-vanishing). They forgot because of _general ambient_ 
neoliberal shock doctrine in effect all over the place, 
which was aided by the OPEC oil crisis, and vicious unrelenting anti-union 
propaganda and CIA infiltrations (or the analog in other countries) --- nothing 
better than corrupt union bosses and violent "left-wing" radicals to aid the 
neoliberal cause in popular Socer Mom and NASCAR Dad normie consciousness 
(controlled opposition). That OPEC inflation was not a natural markets 
effect, it was a monopolist setting price, not the workers with their 
outrageous wage demands.

I've got to believe most ordinary people still do not want violent 
revolution and overthrow of governments. I've got to believe most 
democratically elected representatives are not pure rentier wannabe 
sǝןoɥssɐ.

By the way, as outrageous as it sounds, I think I'd still trust a 
Soccer Mom or NASCAR Dad to back me on wise fiscal policy ahead of an 
over-educated economics or business school graduate. The latter species 
are practically bred psychopaths.  Whoa! Too "populist" for you? Go read 
Thomas Franks.

Not because I trust people in general, I don't, I just trust people because 
I want them to be trustworthy. Like the LBW law in Cricket, benefit of 
the doubt.

This can get you into trouble if the batting side is on a hot streak. 
I admit. But I am not talking here about the power elites, I am talking 
about good ordinary working people and the unemployed. If they crave violent 
revolution I'm not with them, except if the violence is all intellectual 
and plays out in policy, not fisticuffs (a euphemism if ever there was one).

We should want to _overthrow governments_ but this means the people running 
the government, not the institution itself _per se_. History proves this, 
regardless of which side you were on, if any, the fall of the Berlin Wall 
(and all the events surrounding) showed a government can change tune 
practically overnight, without ceasing to be government. 
This can be rapidly accomplished through spiritual education, not technocracy 
and fake-meritocracy (aka. credentialism). I've never seen a bad idea that 
wasn't thoroughly defeated with wisdom.

Governments are not bound by laws of historical materialism. There are no 
such laws. We do not have to wait for the non-existent 'falling rate of 
profit' to materialize. We already have the spiritual means to reform 
government, and kick the current bunch of idiots out of power. The catch 
to this is we need massive collective action, because the mainstream media 
is entirely within the thrall of the financial elites and their socially 
parasitic brainworms. That's my point: there is no effective massive 
collective action absent massive education and wisdom. This takes time.
It can be agonizing. It _is_ agonizing.

This is why all my writing is 
[free-libre Copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html). 
It does no good to wait for donations before I write. This means, anyone 
can copy what is on Ōhanga Pai and modify as they please, provided you 
credit the author for his or her original bits, and not miss-attribute 
by omission.

I know this all _looks and sounds_ naïve, if it does to you then I am 
sorry for you.  To be clear: I am not peddling the Clinton/Obama/Bush 
narrative of, "Go to school and learn to code!" --- oh no, no no! 
$\mathfrak{fUCK}$ that. 

I truly do mean _spiritual_ education: teaching and practicing honesty, 
love, kindness, forgiveness, justice, mercy, compassion and humility.
You'd be surprised Mr Technocrat at the RBNZ and Treasury, how far such 
spiritual virtues get in arriving at good macroeconomic policy. Better 
than all your electricity draining computer models combined. Even beats 
that sometimes mush-brained "Green-Fascist with software"${}^\dagger$ 
technocrat Prof. Steve Keen. (I can write that, he's a friend, so can get 
the joke... if he is in a good non-UBI boosting mood.)

${}^\dagger$ The full title would be "Green-Fascist with software that 
proves accounting identities by assuming the accounting identities." 
Too on-the-nose? lol.

Damn, I had a clever idea to fit with the title, something about how the 
online gaming nerds boost the Trumpistas, the Silicon Valley AI 
technofeudalists and the Elon's, as sort of Mr Anderson/Neo saviours. But that 
topic is a bit toxic for my brain and mental health today. I'm a math-physics 
nerd you see, so I used to like to pretend mathematically literate people 
were _generally_ smart. But it turns out not to be the case. Domain 
specific expertise is a beeaach.
