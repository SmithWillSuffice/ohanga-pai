I was re-watching the [MMT Fiscal Sustainability Conference 2010](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvPLZsgEcXSbdqMUTc-4usIO-9f0xBlc) 
(which has an interesting back-story) and found a lot of gems I'd forgotten. Bill Mitchell is hilarious, in a good way.

It was one of Mosler's though that got me thinking.

At one point Warren says the eurozone member nations are effectively in a ponzi position. 
That's using a particular definition of "ponzi", which in this case was "having to get 
money from someone else". 

So how is that a problem?

It's ponzi because apart from the Germans who could continue net exporting (getting euro 
from someone else) none of the others can. Maybe The Netherlands net export? In any case, 
they cannot all be net exporters or more exactly cannot all have a positive current 
account in euros.

((They could all be net exporters to outside the eurozone, but they're not. And in any 
case, that is not a robust way to guarantee non-ponzi.))

Such is the EMU arrangement that the more aggressive internal within-euroland net 
exporters in euro can effectively force another eurozone member into such a severe 
current account deficit, that the latter runs past the Stability and (non)Growth Pact 
deficit limit, meaning harsh penalties get imposed, needlessly. Should they put the 
SGP back in place post-COVID, and post-Ukraine.
(Put the "lazy" Greeks out of work because they're not working hard enough.)

## The Moral Hazard

When Warren expands upon the point he made about the EU, he talks of the problem in 
terms of a moral hazard. In this context it is a dynamic that can be set up when a 
monetary union (like Australia, or the USA or the EU) is split into competing states. 
If the states are then not fiscally constrained there is the *potential* moral hazard 
of a race to the bottom: who can issue the most currency and sustain inflation 
psychologically long enough before the others crumble.

This is why USA and Australian states are not currency issuers. But in their case the 
Federal government is a fiscal authority constantly injecting US dollars through both 
discretionary but *crucially* through several non-discretionary means, which are 
baked-in to law (welfare payments, pension payments, and various other long term 
budget commitments).

It helps to think of the central government budget as a moral document, not a 
financial document. There is o fiscal constraint on the government, but there is a 
moral constraint in a nominal or semblance of a democracy will (often like hawks) 
maintain. You do not need Wall Street or bankers to impose fiscal discipline, the 
general population is always sufficient. The neoliberal elites of course hate the 
very idea of democracy (a Point Randall Wray made very well at the same conference).
he population at large really does not like like to see their currency inflate --- 
even when the real wage is rising! Go figure. So regardless of the bankers and elite 
pearl clutchers, any reasonable democracy will constrain government. How? Vote them 
out of office and try the other guys.

You might think this could just be a seesaw (or in multi-party democracies a revolving 
door) of spend-thrift governments. But it empirically never works that way. 
Politicians are generally extremely venal, and like having their jobs, so the "next 
set of guys" invariably constrain fiscal policy. Not always in great ways, but they 
do it.

What about the EMU?

The member states are not fiscal authorities, so they've avoided the race to the 
bottom like Australia and th USA. But the problem is they are now in a ponzi 
position, because they have to get euro's of the other guys.

The simple solution is to operate a European Parliament as a fiscal authority.

The best answer why they have not done this is usually given by Bill Mitchell (same 
conference again, or in many places where he writes and speaks). The EU leaders 
seemed to know damn well they needed a parliament, the documents, the minutes, 
written during the long period of formation of the EMU make this very clear.

So why did they not establish a parliament with spending authority?

From what Mitchell gleaned it was because they also knew damn well Europeans are not 
a united people. The Germans and Dutch *hate* the Italians and the Greeks. Not just 
person-to-person, but amorphously, through culture and such like, but that's always a 
complex  aggregate of individual prejudices and subtle hatreds. Yet they wanted some 
sort of cosmopolitan union to compete with the USA!

The idea of the slightly less sociopathic EU leaders was that a currency union 
would somehow over time force a political union.

Well, they might almost have that correct, but it's an unstable game. Greece came 
very close to a Grexit, and th Brits had Charles Goodhart advising against going into 
the eurozone fro the very beginning. (There was no need for Brexit, sine the UK was 
always monetarily sovereign.)



### Why Brexit Then?

Brexit was a pile of nonsense on *all* sides. The UK Parliament could have at any time 
lifted their deficit spending for full employment of the British. But both their Tory 
and Labour parties are equally neoliberal, and have no clue. So it become more an 
immigration fear-mongering issue (for Tories) plus a democracy issue (for Corbynites).

In any case, the UK is better out of the EU in many ways, they just don't know it. 
So, personally, I have in-laws whose grant fundings have been cut, so they're out of 
a nice university research job. Unemployed. It was of course EU funding. No one at 
that university is asking why the UK government cannot fund the research. Why not? 
They are clueless, they do not understand MMT.

Instead of investing in cutting edge biological research then they're investing in 
making people unemployed, highly skilled people. Turning them into high school 
tutors. It's all tragic and needless. Guess the UK will be importing expensive 
vaccines next pandemic.


## They've Got It Backwards

The normies have it backwards in real terms of course, Germany is sending it's stuff to 
Italy and Spain, a win for Italy and Spain. The problem is the political psychology. 
Germans can employ all their workers, whereas the Spanish and Portuguese do not know 
what a good thing they've got, and *choose* (needlessly) to unemploy *their* workers to 
try to vainly satisfy the self-imposed fiscal constraints. Why are they doing this to 
their people? (Don't answer that, there's no good reason.)

They should just get the hell out of the eurozone, but stay in the EU for trade 
liberalization reasons, just ditch the euro currency. The MMT solution.
If the Germans are content to work as the slaves to the Spanish and Portuguese, let 'em.

Guess which EU nation does not net import from Germany? (You tell me, I 
[looked up a few](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/DEU/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/EXPIMP) and lost patience trying to find one.) Seems people really like 
getting German stuff.

((Unless I've got a case of arithmexia and read "exports$-$imports" as "imports$-
$exports", which is always possible when not on peer review strictures.))

I'd like to see the moment when, say Portugal, decide to run full domestic employment, 
then the Germans bark back, "Hoy! You're nicht aloud to treat your people zo nize with 
our ztuff! Ztop it!"

Of course that pretty much *would* be how it goes down, I imagine. German slaps trade 
embargo on Portugal for the punishment of employing all their workers.
Portugal becomes the next mini Cuba. All tragically needless and all because the 
Germans do not see that currently they're losing.

Where does an MMT activist trace this back to? It's got to be class. The German consumer 
is losing, the German export oligarch is winning. Since workers out-number oligarchs 
by about a million to one, overall Germany is losing big time.
