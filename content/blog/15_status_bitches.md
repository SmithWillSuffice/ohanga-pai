Interesting conversation Bill Mitchell had with a Japanese economics "professor" 
(professes to know some economics).

I made a few notes, not too many.

## Japan Slips in GDP/Per Capita Ranking --- so what?

The professor harped on a bit about how Japan had a "lost decade".  Bill explained 
well that it's hard to see in Japan any real loss of output. Their population growth 
is stagnant, so their GDP growth rate will not be anything near to say Australia 
which has a faster growing population.

Professor Satoshi Fujii then pulled up (livestream! so kudos!) some data showing 
the GDP/N rankings. Japan, he said, had "slipped dramatically" over the 00's.
Bill (and me) are like,.. "big deal, so what?"

This is half-joking, because you know what it's a big deal. Japanese culture suffers 
from as much inferiority complex as USA sports culture, they have the be the gdamn 
best... otherwise it's not a real sport. Only the Japanese suffer the inferiority 
complex more than others in industrial economics measures. They have a culture of 
needing to produce the best products. They'll get miffed if the Germans do something 
better. (Not to be stereotyping whole cultures, just telling it like I sometimes see 
it.)

In other words, Satoshi was overstating the "lost decade" of Japan relative to other nations who are also running neoliberal austerity policies, but he was quite right to claim Japan have irretrievably lost potential output, but not only over the last 
decade, over all decades so far.

I was reminded also of the research by Trill van Treeck on why Keynes' vision of a 15 
hour work week by 2000 has not been realized. The main reason is the psychology of 
conspicuous consumption. People wanting to "keep up with the Jones'". You can also 
call it The Rat Race.

Worrying about _relative_ status is a b*tch. Note how sociologist van Treeck 
explains why Keynes' vision of a 15 hour work week is possible but has not 
actualized here:

The wealthy nations caught Veblenitis, aka affluenza, aka ratraceitis.


### Is the Another Minksy Moment Brewing?

This is hard to answer. In the USA circa January 2023, the GOP party holding power want 
to vote to not raise the Congress "debt ceiling" --- the stupidest notion in macroeconomics ever. (They still think their government is using other people's money.)

Bill Mitchell pushed back on this a bit. He claims central bankers have understood 
how to avoid a purely financial crisis (one that does not begin in the real economy, 
so not with war, famine, plague or whathaveyou). 
They know how to prevent another Great Depression (they proved this in 2008) and 
they probably have learned how to stop another Great recession (2008). 
The issue in 2008 was the central bank bailed out Wall Street, not Main Street.

There is no guarantee next time a Minksy upwards instability occurs the central 
bankers will bail out Main Street, but they at least have learned bank bail-outs do 
not cause inflation. Confidence in the banking system is thus probably only a day 
away these days, and hence probably forever after.

This squares with Warren Mosler less pessimistic comments in a 
[forum on eurozone pessimism](https://www.mmtconference.eu/livestream-tuesday/)
in a panel at the 
[2nd European MMT Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9wU5VWGUQ).
The specific segment where Mosler talks about the slow reluctant progression of the EU towards supporting member nations is at about the 
[40 minute mark](https://youtu.be/oz9wU5VWGUQ?t=2375), 
and then he pretty much repeats around 
[48 minutes in](https://youtu.be/oz9wU5VWGUQ?t=2885).
The EU is "almost already there" with nascent MMT awareness, even if it (a) took a 
crisis, and (b) they still do not admit MMT is the reality, and (c) they still have 
not got the progressive buffer of labour, the Job Guarantee. The EU has "backed in 
to the 'right' answer, through a serious of crises..."

The risk of rapidly rising household debt levels is thus no longer purely Minsky, but 
is an investment risk, not a system-wide risk. In the next Minksy fragile period it 
will likely be the case a lot of asset prices will tumble, but they're also likely 
not going to drop too precipitously, only the assets that are truly "junk" will go to 
zero.

The lesson for investors is simple: do not take the risk on junk assets. Avoid the 
ponzi schemes, and avoid even the speculative assets. Trade safe, and wait out a 
recession.

For the DougBot project we aim to get a feel for when a recession is about to be 
triggered. If the central banks obey the 
[Sahm Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahm_Rule) then nothing too bad is going to 
happen. At least not until the *real* economy hits a brick wall, like water, soil, 
fossil fuel, or fisheries depletion.

The phrase "too bad" is of course relative. The tragic thing is low income 
households have "bad" happening all the time, needlessly, through no fault of their 
own, due to government austerity policy. Why needless? They're not the one causing 
any inflation.
