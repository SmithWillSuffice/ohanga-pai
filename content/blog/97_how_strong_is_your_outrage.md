Lost my intial stream of thought...
But it was about the issue of "Abundance".
Vemma Igland versus K'than Elein and Seffry Jachs
```

I belei9ve Seffry Jachs' analysis was fundamentally sound. We do live in an 
era of economic output abundamnce, with two massive problems, 

1. We are producing too much crap no one needs to live a decent life, and 
this is exceeding planetary ecosystem boundaries. Some form of ecological 
collapse is bound to occur if we just blindly run ahead at the present rate 
of tstupid crappy produciton of crappy things.
2. 

You all know full well why millions of joules worht of crappy stuff is 
produced each year. Mindless pursuit of profit. It is not even "Capitalism".
Pure capitalism has to reinvest the profit, otherwise the firm gets 
out-compppeted or the private currency fails to circulate tadn the system 
wihtout government breaks down. We do not have such a system, never have, 
and never will have.  Human communiti3s have always had monetary authorities, 
as long as written records at least are known. Over 6000 years.

It doesn't mean the MMT system (which has existed for over 6000 years) is 
the best currency system possible. I ratehr prefer the Gesell system myself. 
But that is beside the opoit, since if polcy makers understand the system 
then moral economics can take over and we simply do not need to have poverty 
and involuntary unemployment. These things cna be eliminted. Disease and crop 
failues cannopt be eliminated. But poverty can be, almsot overnight.

Disease, polouted water, crop failures, are not the cause of today's 
poverty and unemp[loymet. If this is what Seffry Jachs and K'than Elien 
are syaing, thean ai agreee with them. 

Someone tell the UN SDG people!  Most of the UN SDG efforts are ill-focused. 
They only needto educate governemtns. It is an educaiton problem, perhapsd 
for 16 out of the 17 SDG gols. Perhaps all of them (I can make the case for 
all of them).

This is spiritual economics. Once you understand the monetary system 
inside out, then the real problems bcoem plainly entirely moral and 
spiirtual. Educaiton in this respect, in this context, is a deeply 
spiritual endeavour, not merely utilitarian.

Yes, we should adopt a Gesell Currency, but it doe snot matter if we don't. 
It would be a fine tuning, not a necessity. Unless you ca think of some way 
it can be a moral imperative? I can't. Maybe you can, so good for you, and 
I'd support you.

OK, but _why_ can we not organize society to ge this requisite educaiton 
into the mids of the politicians and policy analysts?

I think you all know the answer!

It is because politiicians and civil sevrants falsely beleive their salaray 
is dependent upoion poltifla donors and tax payers, the most influential of 
whom are oligarchs. SO they are all essentially, whetehr in ignorancve or 
not, working for the oligarchs. Not our brightest people, and certianly not 
our most inwardly beautiful and spiritual people... these oliagrchs and 
plutocrats. In fact they are almost to a person pretty darn evil and heinous.


Which raises the question, since out governemtn is largely controlled by 
these objectively evil people:

> Is the NZ government legitimate?

Increasingly I think not, i think the answer is out governemnt is so oppressive now, that it is no longer legitmate, if it ever was. During the post-war era, maybe there was a case of incipent democrayc of a sort and so the governemtn back then was sufficiently legitimate. I think that is no longer the case today.

Yeah, but it is tricky.

This dioes not warrent pitchforks and kalashnikov's. Because ignorance 
cannot be fought with bullets and knives.

THis si beside the fact I abhor violence in any case, it is never the 
solution. If you hink tkaing up metallic arms against the state is a good solution,

**(a)** you are supid, and have failed to game out the real consequences.  
(the oligarchs have these things... ``\[images of police\]``
