Lost my initial stream of thought...
But it was about the issue of "Abundance".
Vemma Igland versus K'than Elein and Seffry Jachs
```

I believe Seffry Jachs' analysis was fundamentally sound. We do live in an 
era of economic output abundance, with two massive problems:

1. We are producing too much crap no one needs to live a decent life, and 
this is exceeding planetary ecosystem boundaries. Some form of ecological 
collapse is bound to occur if we just blindly run ahead at the present rate 
of stupid crappy production of crappy things.
2. The political system presents massive obstacles for the fair distribution 
of the economic output, leaving millions of unnecessary "have nots". 
The "have nots" can be easily reduced to zero.

How easily? Operationally easy is what I mean.

But to implement these easy simple operations requires political power, and 
this is what we do not have.  We dirtbags that is. 

To be clear, implementing these operation easy solutions would be pretty 
disruptive. To the upper and middle class. It is the Brazilian Lula effect:

> Mr Homoeconomicus: "Too many poor dishevelled unsightly people with 
darker skin than ours are using our airports now. Lula must go."

You all know full well why millions of joules worth of crappy stuff is 
produced each year. Mindless pursuit of profit. It is not even "Capitalism".
Pure capitalism has to reinvest the profit, otherwise the firm gets 
out-competed or the private currency fails to circulate and this pure system 
without government breaks down. We do not have such a system, never have, 
and never will have.  Human communities have always had monetary authorities, 
at least as long as written records are known. Over 6000 years.

It doesn't mean the MMT system (which has existed for over 6000 years) is 
the best currency system possible. I rather prefer the Gesell system myself. 
But that is beside the point, since if policy makers understand the 
scorekeeping system -- whatever it is --- then moral economics can take over 
and we simply do not need to have poverty and involuntary unemployment. These 
things can be eliminated. Disease and crop failures cannot be eliminated. But 
poverty can be, almost overnight.

Disease, polluted water, crop failures, are not the cause of today's 
poverty and unemployment. If this is what Seffry Jachs and K'than Elien 
are saying, then I agree with them. 

Someone tell the UN SDG people!  Most of the UN SDG efforts are ill-focused. 
They only need to educate governments. It is an education problem, perhaps 
for 16 out of the 17 SDG goals. Perhaps all of them (I can make the case for 
all of them).

This is spiritual economics. Once you understand the monetary system 
inside out, then the real problems become plainly entirely moral and 
spiritual. Education in this respect, in this context, is a deeply 
spiritual endeavour, not merely utilitarian.

Yes, we should adopt a Gesell Currency, but it doe snot matter if we don't. 
It would be a fine tuning, not a necessity. Unless you ca think of some way 
it can be a moral imperative? I can't. Maybe you can, so good for you, and 
I'd support you.

OK, but _why_ can we not organize society to ge this requisite educaiton 
into the mids of the politicians and policy analysts?

I think you all know the answer!

It is because politicians and civil servants falsely believe their salary 
is dependent upon political donors and tax payers, the most influential of 
whom are oligarchs. SO they are all essentially, whether in ignorance or 
not, working for the oligarchs. Not our brightest people, and certainly not 
our most inwardly beautiful and spiritual people... these oligarchs and 
plutocrats. In fact they are almost to a person pretty darn evil and heinous.


Which raises the question, since out government is largely controlled by 
these objectively evil people:

> Is the NZ government legitimate?

Increasingly I think not, I think the answer is our government is so 
oppressive now, that it is no longer legitimate, if it ever was. During the 
post-war era, maybe there was a period of incipient democracy of a sort and so 
the government back then was sufficiently legitimate. I think that is no 
longer the case today.

Yeah, but it is tricky.

This does not warrant pitchforks and kalashnikov's. Because ignorance 
cannot be fought with bullets and knives.

This is beside the fact I abhor violence in any case, it is never the 
solution. If you think taking up metallic arms against the state is a 
good solution,

**(a)** you are stupid, and have failed to game out the real consequences.  
(the oligarchs have these things... ``[images of police]``  
**(b)** you have miss-diagnosed the real problem, so would be attempting 
to administer a failed solution.

Most people in government, in civil service are not evil. 
They are ignorant. Their evil is rather banal: they think they are already 
smart people, and so fail to bother to learn.

It is possible to counter such banal evil with a smile and an offer of 
bread & coffee.  Everyone go and invite a local friendly neighbourhood 
neoliberal to lunch.

Don't say this to them out loud, but here is the motivation:

> For heavens sake Mr and Mrs Neoliberal middle class domesticated fool: your 
ignorance is bordering on obscenity.  So stop that!

If they refuse to hear you out in civil polite conversation, _then_ you can
think about the pitchfork... or quantum eraser. Get back to me on that 
one, I'm still working on it.

Sincere effort at education is a nice form of one-on-one violence. The 
violence is done to the ignorant person's thoughts. It might also raise 
their blood pressure momentarily, but that can be dealt with pharmaceutically
at relatively low cost. The police cannot do a thing about this, even if 
they do drive our education underground.

(Here I am thinking of the Baháʼí people in Iran who were still running 
childrens schools underground, at risk of being arrested and tortured --- this 
was under both the former Shah's pogrom and the current reign of the 
Ayatollah's by the way.  Not all Islam by mere name is Peace.  Same as no 
all Christianity is Christian... et cetera, et cetera.) 

Education and work are our most powerful weapons against all forms of 
oppression. Sprinkle education liberally. Withhold your labour from those 
who will exploit, give your labour to those who need you.

Don't complain to me the method is too slow. What do you think we are, 
miracle workers?
