Recent "friendlies" were hosting UBI shills, stabbing us in the back and twisting 
the knife, so I had to write to defend MMT.

I am so bitter about this I cannot name names, because that would imply 
friendly banter. I have to attack the ideas.

When I name names, like Jason Hickel, or Michael Hudson, or Paul Krugman, or 
Richard Wolff, and have something against their ideas to say, I'm always doing it 
in a good faith friendly way. That's because I trust (some of) these people. 
That is, I trust they are writing or speaking in good faith. Sometimes I see their 
ideas are born out of ignorance, and so results in straw-manning MMT, but I can 
usually see where the fault lies, and so will not shy from calling hem out. I know 
full well I could be misinterpreting them, or might even have things wrong myself on 
the facts.

However, UBI and crypto-noncurrency are different stories. These are things that 
act directly against working class interests, and in the most insidious ways --- 
since it is not hard to "sell" a good decent honest working class pleb on these 
ideas.  Who doesn't want the get rich quick (crypto) or have free money (UBI)?
