A few notes on the flurry of news media on AI technology and fears of new AI 
monopoly owners held by tech giants, or the same powers open source released for 
rogue actors and rogue states to exploit. Some of this commentary is good, some 
terrible.

The biggest tragedy is all the politicians and commentariate screaming bloody murder 
about "jobs" being taken away. They are utterly ignorant and have zero comprehension 
of MMT. I think this needs endless highlighting, and I will not relent. Any chance to 
repeat I will take.

* <font style="color: palegreen;">Unemployment is an unspent income story </font>--- the monopoly currency issuer (government) 
not issuing enough currency to satisfy the need to pay taxes and the desires to save 
in their currency.

* <font style="color: skyblue;">Machine automation is a productivity gain story, and 
has nothing to do with unemployment.</font> The *way* we work can change, no one below 
median wage ever needs to eat a salary cut. 

In fact useful AI, as opposed to mindless entertainment AI rubbish, permits firms to 
pay workers higher salaries. Sales drive wages and profits, not technology.


## Why Justice is Central

Machine automation should allow us to free people up to get on with better things in 
life, like spend more time with their children, or help out (on a decently paid wage) 
with a local community permaculture garden and whatnot. Or if the children have any 
sense the parents can be fooled into thinking they can spend more time with their 
kids.

After a while, and after MMT awareness is more widespread, it is hard to see machine 
automation having any down-side for worker emancipation. You just have to be able to 
tell your boss to piss off if they get too demanding and bourgie. An MMT informed 
government always has the power to empower workers in this fashion, always, without 
question.

With freedom more or less taken care of, or *as much freedom as anyone ever needs* 
(we live in a society, so slackers should not be tolerated, everyone can contribute 
something) the real serious issue is <font style="color: #D1D130;">Justice</font>.

[Democracy Now!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHwP0yYciF8) ran a story on the AI 
regulation hearings. Like I wrote above, there is some good and some bad. Apart from 
the way mainstream media get the unemployment story all wrong, there is one other 
issue I want to highlight here today, which is moral freedom.

What people generally are not cognizant of is the work of people like 
[Samuel Bowles](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300230512/the-moral-economy/), 
who point out when laws and regulations take away the need for moral decision making, 
things can get worse, not better. Bowles is not MMT aware, so says some stupid sh1t 
about taxation and whatnot, but in his area of expertise he is insightful and should 
be widely read by the policy makers and commentariat.

Here is my pithy observation posted to the Democracy Now! report:

> Huh, turns out Philosophy is not really all that useless after all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g840ez9xbt0  (think your own thoughts, be authentic. Turn off sensationalist media crap and saccharin. Read a few books each week.)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice... By Its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of they neighbour... Set it then before thine eyes." - Bahá'u'lláh (1857).
