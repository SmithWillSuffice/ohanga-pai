An internet friend, Nadine, sent me a link to a recent interview with 
Michael Hudson. I appreciated. Actually it was only a reaction video to an interview with Hudson,
[“Michael Hudson Actually Caused All This!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePds45e5JXU)

However, Hudson often makes me cringe. He is MMT aware, and friendly-ish, 
but not a proper MMT expert. This makes for sound cringebites worth 
commenting upon briefly.

I just wanted to get a few things off my chest with these latest cringebites.

## There was No Gold Standard

OK, there was a period of gold standard, but you need to appreciate the 
pretence that is was. Apart from commodity traders looking to make a buck aprasitcally, or jewelers, or electrocnics folks, few people needed gold, and so never redeemed currency for gold.  When you have a omnetary system where people are not redeeming for gold in any meaningful way, you do not have a gold standard.

But you can still call it a Gold Standard era if there is a legal prmiose to redeem for gold. I'll give you that, but that is all.

So I can unashamedly post this sport of comment,

> @5:00 that is a myth. It was not truly a gold standard. It was thought to 
be. But few states ever redeemed currency for gold, and the paper claims on 
gold reserves regularly exceeded the total gold supply at Fort Knox or 
wherever, I believe by several times over, so this is *_not_* a gold standard, 
it was a political pretense at such to impose worker austerity, and applicable 
as policy by justification because of fixed exchange rate regimes (which are 
entirely unnecessary self-imposed constraints, more austerity).    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to floating exchange rates meant 
the pretense was officially over, but the gold standard had been gone well 
before that move. Yet gold standard mindsets prevail in the form of fixed 
exchange rate *mentality*, which is inapplicable today, but the policies 
designed for fixed exchange rates (aka. fiscal austerity and interest 
rate/inflation targeting) remain, entirely unnecessarily. The correct and 
_only necessary target_ on a floating exchange rate is full employment, and 
secondarily (but important for economic justice, if this is what we desire) 
fair distribution (i.e., euthanize the rentiers).


## Out-cucking the Radical Academics

The dude doing the reaction vdo also made some remark about how activist or 
"radical" academics often do work that gets egregiously co-opted by finance 
capital. You know the Thomas Franks story --- right-wing fake-populists 
co-opt the language of true leftipol populists. That sort of thing, on larger 
scales.

The right-wingers are even far superior at using leftist populist memes and 
language. They cloak it in the Slitherin veil of prosperity gospel shyte, 
and the like. Pretty disgusting. ("Youz get what youz dezoyves!")

Felt I had to stick up for the shitty science profession which amorally 
allows finance capital to run all over the tech fruits of science,

> @3:50 it is far more acute a problem in science, my field. Finance capital 
will seek to make a buck off workers by any means possible, and high tech 
advances under the systemic forces prevailing only accelerate that fleecing of 
the working class, and increase evisceration of the precariat. The USA is the 
most prosperous nation on Earth, and *_also_* one of the the most unequal, so 
has some of the worst austerity atrocities, and this is _by no fault_ of the 
employed as individuals.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to understand the source of 
unemployment. It is not the private sector. It is the government, the State 
creates all unemployment by design, it's called fiscal austerity: they never 
issue enough currency to meet the non-government sectors needs to pay taxes 
and satisfy net savings desires, the result is mal-distribution, the top One 
Percent can pay taxes and save, the bottom 90 Percent cannot possibly, by 
simple accounting identity, they go into bank debt in order to pay taxes and 
live paycheck to paycheck.

Scientists are typically far better cucks and enablers of capital pigs than 
radical academics.

Although, you know... you have to hand it to Hudson for being the dumbest 
person alive who ever wrote about Superimperialism. If you or I had 
discovered the basics of superimperialism would we have been working for 
the Neocons at the Hudson Institute? ((Hudson is no dummy, but is one of 
the few who wrote about Superimperialism. So he is simultaneously one of 
the smartest and one of the dumbest to have written on Superimperialism.))

I know, I know, Michael tells us he was an infiltrator. Ok dude. 

To be fair, he has spoken up on all this, so he has become an infiltrator I 
guess. It is just a very weird trajectory. First enable the Necons, along 
with Reagan, Cheney and Rumsfeld, then tell folks how you did that, and 
that you were all along fighting against injustice? 


## Health is Not Healthcare

I grabbed the bit about the USA being simultaneously the greatest 
and the worst on Earth from 
[Dr Stephen Bezruchka](https://stephenbezruchka.com/) (author of "*Inequality Kills Us All*"), and his interview on 
[Real Progressives here](https://realprogressives.org/podcast_episode/episode-253-death-by-inequality-with-stephen-bezruchka/0).
Check it out, it is good.

If you have good health then you do not need healthcare. A good cognitive 
dissonance talking point to keep in mind. 

OK, but how does one gain good health? Do we not need a good public 
healthcare system? Bezruchka argues, "No!" 

Or rather, yes we do desire a good healthcare system, but the best 
healthcare system is one with the fewest people needing it. How does that happen?

Bezruchka explains that politics is the first health provider, not the 
healthcare stuff (hospitals and the like). If we have decent politics, proper 
democracy, equality, full non-bs employment, economic justice, then the 
demands upon the healthcare system reduce dramatically, and people are 
generally far healthier, just form good politics.

Those who say, "Oh, well that's all well and good, but out politics is 
stuffed, so there is no hope!" are neoliberal enablers, and should be sent 
to Gulag comrade.
