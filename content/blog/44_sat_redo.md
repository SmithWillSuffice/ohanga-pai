These days I don't get much free time to check out the math-sci youtubes, 
but every so often Veritasium or some other offers a click bait title I 
cannot resist. There was this on on the infamous SAT coin rolling problem. 
[“The SAT Question Everyone Got Wrong”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)

That's intriguing because you know there's a deeper story behind it than 
merely "it was just a hard problem".

## SAT Administration

The issue that prompted this blog today is the almost throw-away remark 
Veritasium made near the end on the inability of the SAT to re-score all the 
tests, citing it'd cost too much money that "came out of the pockets of the 
test takers."

I thought:

1. Why would they charge people for a re-score, if the question was known to 
be bogus? It's an ethics issue, not a finance issue, and SAT board got the 
ethics wrong.
2. The cost is in real terms -- the examiners could be doing something better, 
or could they? It is still a public good to be fixing badly scored tests. 
3. The monetary cost is then irrelevant, the government just marks up the bank accounts of the examiners who have to re-score all the tests. Fair compensation 
for these workers, presumably they were not the ones writing the bad question.


Hopefully someone at Veritasium takes note of my comment:

> @15:25 SAT officials made another huge error of _far more overriding 
importance_ in fact an epic tragedy. The cost of redoing the scoring does 
*_not_* "come out of the pockets of test takers". That's a macroeconomic myth. 
There is in fact no such thing as "tax payer funding". No one can pay a dime 
in tax until the issuer of the currency first issues it, or licences chartered 
banks as agents of the state to issue credit (which is not net currency 
creation, has to be paid back with interest).  Tax payers cannot (legally) 
fund the government in monetary terms, that'd mean they're engaging in 
counterfeit. Tax payers and others "fund" the government in *_real terms_* by 
exchanging their goods or labour in return to that which is accepted for 
payment of taxes, fees, levies and other imposed liabilities (aka. US dollars, 
or yen, pounds, euro, peso, etc. the numeraire for whatever country imposes 
these liabilities by force of the state).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the US government can issue USD by 
fiat, and they tell you what it's worth, and the "cost" is a vote in Congress 
for the authorization, the operation is simply taking a computer at the 
central bank and typing in numbers to mark up the bank accounts of the 
employees re-marking the SAT test. That's a real cost in terms of those 
employees could be doing something else more useful perhaps, but it is not a 
monetary cost for any tax payer, in fact the issued wage for the government 
employees gets spent (presumably) thus helping someone else pay their taxes.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this error is an epic 
tragedy is that it applies not just to lack of willingness to re-score SAT 
tests, but to the entire macroeconomy. The false thinking about "tax payer 
funding" is a cause of neoliberal austerity policy and massive wastes of human 
lives in unemployment --- forever lost output --- exceeding the costs of all 
major wars in human history.


OK, that the macro.

Sounds like SAT is begin phased out. Probably good riddance.
Entrance qualifications for university programs do need to be in place, 
limited teaching resources and all that, but with MIT, Standford, Harvard and 
other universities freely able to publish lectures and course materials 
online, no paper printing cost and whatnot, do we really need to restrict 
university placements? Perhaps we do?  After all, chatGPT is showing there is 
still a role for teachers, it requires honest human work to assess students 
for certifications if they're able to plagiarize chatGPT.

If universities are going to continue as our main source of higher education 
and qualification, then standard need to be met. But information technology is 
constantly lowering the real costs involved, and universities should be 
lowering the cost of education, not increasing it!  This is a public funding 
issue. 

Also I'm talking about inflation adjusted costs, so the real costs.

If the real resources we once had are still available they have to be 
realistically in total a lot cheaper now, so university fees should be 
practically zero. The real cost to enter a university and do all the 
formalities of accreditation should be the intellectual cost. You have to 
prove you are worthy.

On that score, I advocate giving students all the time they need. There is no 
need for a rush through college. If they fail a course once, provided they 
wish to continue and have the entrance requirements, let them keep trying.


## The Coin Puzzle

> Roll a circle of radius $R/3$ around a bigger circle of radius $R$.  How many 
times will the smaller circle rotate around it's center? 

Apparently a 1980's SAT test did not offer the correct answer in the 
multichoice. 

Most students would say it rotates $3$ times around, since the smaller coin circumference being $2\pi R/3$ unrolls $3$ times get once around the larger 
coin of circumference $2\pi R$.

However, this is not the case. 

While the story about the circumferences is correct, it does not dictate the 
full rotation of the small coin around it's center, that's because in 
*addition* to unrolling it's circumference around the bigger coin, the smaller 
coin is also "in orbit" (so-to-speak) around the larger coin, and that orbit 
accounts for one extra rotation.

Hence the total number of rotations of the small coin is $3+1 = 4$.


### Generalizations

The cool thing in the Veritasium episode is the generalization to rolling a 
circle around any shape. Triangle, square, pentagon, or even a line.

For only one of these will the small circle rotate around it's center the 
naive expected perimeter divided by small circle circumference number of 
times. Which one?

Answer: The line of course. (No additional orbit.)

What about rolling to coin inside another shape? 

In this case the inner "orbit" is subtractive, you have to subtract one 
circumference. So the result is the ratio of the shape's perimeter to the 
small coin circumference minus $1$.
