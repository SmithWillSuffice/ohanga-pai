These days I don't get much free time to check out the math-sci youtubes, 
but every so often Veritasium or some other offers a click bait title I 
cannot resist. There was this on on the infamous SAT coin rolling problem. 
[“The SAT Question Everyone Got Wrong”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)

That's intriguing because you know there's a deeper story behind it than 
merely "it was just a hard problem".

The issue that prompted this blog today is the almost throw-away remark 
Veritasium made near the end on the inability of the SAT to re-score all the 
tests, citing it'd cost too much money that "came out of the pockets of the 
test takers."

I thought:

1. Why would they charge people for a re-score, if the question was known to 
be bogus? It's an ehtics issue, not a finance issue, and SAT board got the 
ethics wrong.
2. The cost is in real terms -- the examiners could be doing something better, 
or could they? It is still a public good to be fixing badly scored tests. 
3. The monetary cost is then irrelevant, the government just marks up the bank accounts of the examiners who have to re-score all the tests.Fair compensation 
for these workers, presumably they were not the ones writing the bad question.


Hopefully someone at Veritasium takes not of me=y comment:

> @15:25 SAT officials made another huge error of _far more overriding 
importance_ in fact an epic tragedy. The cost of redoing the scoring does 
*_not_* "come out of the pockets of test takers". That's a macroeconomic myth. 
There is in fact no such thing as "tax payer funding". No one can pay a dime 
in tax until the issuer of the currency first issues it, or licences chartered 
banks as agents of the state to issue credit (which is not net currency 
creation, has to be paid back with interest).  Tax payers cannot (legally) 
fund the government in monetary terms, that'd mean they're engaging in 
counterfeit. Tax payers and others "fund" the government in *_real terms_* by 
exchanging their goods or labour in return to that which is accepted for 
payment of taxes, fees, levies and other imposed liabilities (aka. US dollars, 
or yen, pounds, euro, peso, etc. the numeraire for whatever country imposes 
these liabilities by force of the state).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the US government can issue USD by 
fiat, and they tell you what it's worth, and the "cost" is a vote in Congress 
for the authorization, the operation is simply taking a computer at the 
central bank and typing in numbers to mark up the bank accounts of the 
employees re-marking the SAT test. That's a real cost in terms of those 
employees could be doing something else more useful perhaps, but it is not a 
monetary cost for any tax payer, in fact the issued wage for the government 
employees gets spent (presumably) thus helping someone else pay their taxes.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this error is an epic tragedy is that it applies not just to lack of willingness to re-score SAT tests, but to the entire macroeconomy. The false thinking about "tax payer funding" is a cause of neoliberal austerity policy and massive wastes of human lives in unemployment --- forever lost output --- exceeding the costs of all major wars in human history.
