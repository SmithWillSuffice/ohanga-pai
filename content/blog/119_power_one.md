## The Tangled Webbs of Transparent Deceit

Anyone who has read both Aaron Good and Whitney Webb (we could name drop 
several more, but let's not name drop) will know of how the 
US deep state is a misnomer. There is a state within a state, just as 
Angleton's CIA within the CIA. But it is global in span. The US empire is 
global. The USA is a convenient geographic hub because it is the ideal place 
to run organized crime and criminal sub-government enterprises.

I've got a message though for good honest people in government positions, 
which is; do not feel you are complicit, speak out, whistle blow, don't shy 
away from exposing the corruption in the system you are a part of, and do not 
fear for losing your salary. I'd cite 
[Sibel Edwards](https://sibeledmonds.com/) as a good exemplar, she 
only spent about one year in the FBI before realizing she had to whistleblow.

Although Edmonds and Aaron have a lot of content behind paywalls, those with 
the means aught to support them because they trickle out a bit of free tier 
content for us plebs, and it is good stuff to know. At least be aware about.

((Huge Boooo! _otherwise_ to paywalled websites. I mean, 
what are you doing guys? Asking us to pay for honest reportage. I'll donate 
more than most people would fro their income to such Indie reporting, but I 
refuse to go via a paywall like Patreon, who are taking a gross cut of the 
donations. Always conduct due diligence on the payments platform. I believe 
KoFi is ok, and a few others, make sure you are not accidentally donating 
to corporate fascists=ic outfits.  This is also why I specifically ask 
readers _not_ to subscribe to my substack, stay of the free tier, you won't 
miss anything form me.'))


## Anti-government Government

This is a potential utter mess of a topic, so I'll try to minimize the 
keystrokes to get the point across.

* We need government (not for survival or anything, but just for a 
civil society). We do not need corrupt government.
* We should desire democracy. we have never had a democracy.
* We need to be anti-_that_-government, and we need to be 
pro-_this_-government. (You get the drift of what `_this_`' and '_that_' 
mean I trust.... it will be government that holds the JEE and organized 
crime bosses to account in one way or another, if ever they are held to 
account. It will not be our consumer boycotts.)
* Refugees and victims of ethnic cleansing did need **_the resources_** 
provided by USAID. But [the world did not need USAID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM).
* Government must do big fiscal. Government must be frugal about _real resources_. 
But that means fully employing available sustainable resources. But not in a 
wage-slavery manner.
* THE CIA within the CIA has not been government supported. The CIA within 
the CIA does not get Congressional appropriations, which is why those 
particular darker covert operations need you to be a drug user, a boozer, and 
a sex addict. Angleton's branch of government has to use drug, pr0n, booze, 
prostitution (aka. "hospitality"), gambling and sex trafficking to get funded. 
That branch of government _is_ 
"tax payer funded." The only branch that really is. 
* Stop funding that branch of government. It's a better reason to stop using 
drugs or gambling etc than anything Topper Gore ever said.
* Having noted all that, US Congress is enabling fascism through Its 
neoliberalism, so even the good folks in Congress and parliaments around the 
world are not speaking out enough, and arre far too naïve. Guys and gals in 
the seats, it's ok to lift-up rocks now and again to see what is underneath. 
The criminal enterprises are not boogeymen when you expose them to the sunlight. 
* On a darker note, if you are an honest person desiring to enter into 
government, I think you have to be completely unafraid to get assassinated. 
At least in the USA and other kleptocratic nations (Saudi Arabia, The EU, 
Turkey, Nigeria, and so on, it's a long list).

We could go deeper. BDS these days means much more than boycotting known 
Israeli businesses and their ties, since the network of the CIA--Mossad--Mafia 
worldwide crime syndicate (a "network" really, since it's a mess of inside 
blackmailing and grift against the grifters against the grifters). You get 
the picture.

Odds are you are still indirectly funding _with your actual tax dollars_ some 
zionist project or another. I might even be doing so myself when I purchase my 
coffee beans? But I'll be damned if I _know about_ the company behind the beans 
is part of the worldwide crime racket and then continue buying those beans.

It's not a huge waste of time to just skim some consumer products and 
realize you should boycott them. Start with Micro$oft and Apple Inc. products, 
I would say, and do not give Spotify, Joe Rogan, or anyone else in that space 
your cash, and do not even give them advertising revenue by clicking on them 
for "free". They're owning your eye-balls you realize.  The entire Pop Music 
industry is another one to boycott. It's not going to make you life more 
miserable to not support pop music and Marvel movies.

If you wish to "break the law" to boycott but still "consume" the content 
then pirate website might be a valid way to go about it, but you have to 
realize they still in effect are owning your eye-balls, since the propaganda 
is deep in these corporate entertainment complex layers.  I'd just advise get 
other hobbies, like theoretical physics, rock climbing or gardening.

Giving up hope on civil society is not the answer. But you do get some 
elements of nihilism and doomerism in Aaron Good's podcasts. It's forgiveable. 
It is remarkable though when Aaron does offer a positive outlook, precisely 
because he's one of those researchers who has gone deep into the near 
bottomless pit of corruption and organized crime that is part of much of 
the world wide system of government. I am pretty sure it touches the UN as 
well. TO emerge from such research without going full nihilist is a testament 
to Aaron's good character. That's why I can listen to some of his more 
outrageous claims without getting too skeptical. Conspiracy theories are 
always a little dubious because they are conspiracy theories, but not all 
theories are wrong.

However, regarding things like the JFK assassination, or really the 
assassination of the good four (JFK, MLK, Malcom X, RFK) --- it's distraction 
I reckon. There have been far more important figures assassinated. I do not 
even know where to begin, but some names that drop into my head without 
an internet search would be Mossadegh, Nassar, Sankara, Allende, ... that's not 
even to mention those not yet assassinated, like Dilma-Rousseff, who was 
"generous" enough to not believe the US/CIA was behind her impeachment.

I think the point is, they did not have to be. The worldwide organized 
government-mafia crime network does not always need the CIA. So it is 
immaterial whether the CIA was behind the Brazilian lawfare. Those material 
realities do matter when people can be held to account, but the work the 
pro-worker peace-camp has ahead is far harder than just getting a few 
foot-soldiers for global zionist-fascism-plutocracy on The Hague chopping 
blocks and whatnot.

(This reminds me of one of Aaron's positive comments, which is that a 
worldwide peace & reconciliation process is needed for all the neocons and 
neoliberals, since the crimes have surpassed those of apartheid South Africa, 
so we are far beyond jail cell punishments by now.)

The global Tory-conservative reich-wing empires are always fully prepared to 
sacrifice foot soldiers. JEE the most recent "in the news."

But even if i drew up a full list of all the peace-leaders, it'd be nothing 
but a list. The names do not matter. Which is not to say erasing the names 
from history is good, it's not good, but it is to say far more unnamed people 
have been the real power behind these courageous spokespeople for The People. 
When a Sanakara or an Allende gets killed, millions of ordinary people have 
been killed. Because their hope has been dashed. Their spirits weakened, which 
is the worse thing.  Which is precisely why we simply cannot afford to place 
our trust and hope in the big name leaders. They are only temporary 
spokespeople, always, nothing more.

The best thing about Jeremy Corbyn (2016 version), was not Corbyn, it was 
the idea of enabling worker cooperatives. 

## The Polyarchy

One thing I wanted to get off my chest todya is MMT related, and concerns 
USAID, and I am grateful to Aaron Good and his guest [Ben Thomason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM) on [The Devil’s Chessboard podcat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePP6Koc9KPM).

I've read and heard far too many liberals attacking DJT and DOGE for 
defunding USAID.

Wanna know my take?

GOod damn riddance to USAID. 

The USA is not a world saviour superman. No one anywhere ever needed USAID nor 
the National Endowment for Democracy a more anti-democratic institution is 
hard to find). This are both highly anti-democratic organizations, promoting 
fascist-zionism in the most insidious ways. There are ordinary workers employed 
or volunteering for such organizations who are innocent and doing good things. 
But it is a total fabricated myth that the US dollar was ever needed for such 
efforts, and a total myth they were promoting real democracy.

(See my previous post on why the US dollar was never a 
"global reserve currency" --- no one has ever needed US$ except the US 
tax payer. I've never handled a US dollar myself, except when working as 
a postdoc on an H1B in the USA.  What I've used, probably quite a bit, are 
international banking swaplines --- spreadsheet operations which from my end 
only _ever_ concern NZ dollars.

If I'd have had a few billion NZD I could have funded everything good that 
USAID were supposed to be doing, but minus the propaganda.

When not overt CIA fronts, these organizations are low-key propagandists 
for American capitalist corporate values --- "greed is good" stuff. "Being rich 
makes you virtuous" stuff.  "Venture philanthropy" stuff. "Profit make to 
do good" stuff.  Since I cannot devote much time to researching 
the topic of how corporatist propaganda spreads through soft neocolonialism, 
corporate philanthropy (fake 𝕒𝕗) and all that crud, I am glad to have found 
Ben Thomason has done that hard work.

That interview with ben is where I first heard the term Polyarchy. 
That's "rule by a whole blend of neocons, neoliberals, zionist-christian, 
right-wingnuts, coopted leftist rubes, liberal moralists (anti-moral people), 
mafia bosses,union bosses, and all the rest.

By the way, am I saying it is a _)good thing_ DJT and his cronies shut 
down USAID?

I think so, yes. It's a normie establishment liberal hair-on-fire reaction to 
think closing down USAID "killed millions." The starving of the real aid 
probably did kill millions. But that was not the fault of DJT. Every country 
where people were starving and dying from the local genocides and ethnic 
cleansings could have easily been avoided by other nations shipping in the 
supplies. The US dollar was never needed, and the goods from the USA were 
not either, there are plenty of other sources for the supplies that the 
refugees needed.  IF the USA happens to contribute a substantial fraction, 
then great. But it never had to be USAID. The UN would have sufficed. The UN 
does not need the US dollar for funding, any currency will suffice.

New Zealand should just drop a trillion dollar NZD coin in the bank account 
of the UN.  Then people will have the precious NZD to buy stuff with for the 
UN deployment. What are they gonna buy?  If it's not for sale in New Zealand 
they're going to have to buy from somewhere else. They could always do so 
with the NZD. It would not weaken the NZD. The forex lines are not the source 
of the NZD price level. What else can I tell you?

Would this have some re-gauge effects domestically in NZ?  Probably. But 
so what? It would not limit the NZ government capacity to run domestic full 
employment, so would have no bad consequences for the NZ economy. We do not 
have to export anything we do not desire to export surplus to our domestic 
needs. Not ever. We need foreign oil. So we need to export to "pay for" 
those imports.  If our government had the political support from the people 
to trillion-dollar coin fund the UN, we could do it. It's always the 
political will to spend, not the scorepoint capacity.

Back to the global mafia-government worldwide empire

Yeah, so our governments are not a global mafia state network.  This is not 
the message you should be receiving. Many parts of our governments are part 
of a global fascist mafia world state. It's a very messy thing. 

For example; was Bill Clinton compromised? No doubt. Was he a fascist? 
Probably not. Was he worse than a fascist since he was captured by 
neoliberalism? (A far more insidious cause of mass human suffering.)  Yes, I'd 
say so. I prefer my fascist with their swastika on 
their sleeve, preferably their proud forehead.

The governments have been infected with fascist-zionism-mafiosi, that's just 
a fact. This does not make the government inherently corrupt institutions. It 
means you aught to be very wary of any government policy that smells a bit 
fishy and reeks of the "privatization of public services" meme, since that's 
the stuff that is revealing the infection. That's what needs laser surgery 
removal.

### Where to point the laser beams?

Well, I do not think that's a hard question to answer, you only need to do a 
tiny bit of research, and often the crooked politicians are just saying the 
quiet part out loud. Any "user pays" or "efficiency of the private sector" 
or "we're wastin' tax payer dollars" rhetoric is self-revealing the cancer that 
needs to be zapped.

And yes, even TYT, Krystal & Kyle, and the Majority Report and all the rest 
of the liberal media are part of the rot, they're all about the "wastin' of 
the tax payer dollars." That has to to be zapped. Let me be clear once more: 
when you buy your drugs for your partying, _you are the tax payer funder._ 
And that's the _only_ time you are the proverbial "tax payer funder".
You are funding the extra-governmental syndicates of criminal global 
governance, the non-government government. The tax payer funds the 
private sector. 

The whole point is to stop having our governments being run by the 
private sector. Because when they are run by the private sector they 
are "tax payer funded." That's the _only_ time "government" is 
tax payer funded.

The deep state, the particularly criminal branch of it, is in the private 
sector. That is whom you are funding when you consume slop, like Coca Cola,
Nestlé, Spotify, Netflix, AppleInc., and all the rest. Have a cut-back on 
some of that stuff, is what I'd suggest. Its a minimal least effort.

Does this mean buying a few bananas from the grocery store shipped by some 
global fascist mafia-like run fruit-grower worker exploitation corporation 
is complicit? No, of course not. 
No more so than watching your favourite Marvel movies.  But yet there are 
things you can live without, and it is a good thing to try to live without 
for a while. 

But do we instead say, regarding government terrorism: "Ok, it is so infected 
now, it just has to be euthanized, the hole lot!"

No. I do not think we are there yet. I guess we coudl get there, but there 
are still too many good people in government, they are not the prominent 
headline names of curse, but it si a baby & bath water situation, from what 
I can tell.

What is one to do?

My first answer is to at least not be a dupe, a rube, deliberately ignorant 
doomers or boomers (neither!), and educate yourself. Just do what little you 
can to fight back. 
Best to join a pro-worker pro-justice organization somewhere, one with 
good organic leaders, not an unelected hierarchy.
But it cannot be anarchist, it has to be well-organized or you are wasting your effort. (If in doubt, learn this from 
[Vincent Bevin (“If We Burn”)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_We_Burn).)
You maybe shouldn't love Bernie, but he was more organic than Obama. Obama 
came from a neoliberal lab experiment.
