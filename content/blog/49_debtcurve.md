I'm at it again [with Michael Hudson (here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cQbyYBUvzY).

I guess he is doing a good job opening people's eyes and ears. But I wish 
he'd not continue being so coarse. It's ok to talk in nuanced terms, and 
not jar your audience all the time. But maybe it's just my sensitive 
ears.

## Exponential Growth

He got me started about 10 minutes in to the [interview](https://youtu.be/4cQbyYBUvzY?t=608)

This is one annoying thing, it always irritates. Whenever anyone outside 
of mathematics class starts talking about exponentials. There are no such 
functions in nature except for abstract fall off in quantum and/or 
gravitational field amplitudes.

So monetary debt never grows exponentially. If the payments are not made, and 
interest is charged, then your debt (or net households debt) will grow roughly 
exponentially, for a while, until there is government fiscal injection to 
repay, or recycling from firm profits back into the households, or rich 
bastards extract bank credit and distribute to the poor bastards, the workers 
and unemployed (one might vainly hope).

So what is the actual debt growth curve?

### Growth Curve Balls

Firstly, **(a)** it is not always growing, and **(b)** it is irregular.
One can only say the household debt will grow when the government debt 
shrinks, and/or foreign net spending and transfers decline. Accounting 
identities.

But it is true that the general trend that causes recessions is a weal 
sort of growth in debt. It can be linear, power law, or sub-exponential, 
or for brief periods, when no payments are being made, it can grow 
exponentially. One cannot really ever tell though, since the economic data 
is not fine enough for an exact curve fit.

Thus, even when it is exponential growth for a short run, we cannot tell.
Not to worry though, the key idea from Hudson is still correct, which is 
that left in supported by government fiscal spending, households cannot 
simply work harder producing real goods for sale and pay off their debt. 
The debt growth will out-pace the real economic growth. 

Unless there is a massive one-off price adjustment upwards (some may 
falsely call this inflation) so that the nominal value of past debt 
becomes overnight insignificant compared to tomorrows income.  That's 
damn, right, inflation is not necessarily a bad thing, if it is purely 
in nominal terms, and purely effected just by increasing the minimum wage 
**_only_** or the public sector workers wage rate.


## The economic justice issue

Exponential increase in private debt is the problem, not government 
debt. But it does not truly grow exponentially, due to fairly regular 
predictable debt default and bankruptcy (in the olden times, debtors prison). 
The problem with that (with the mechanism by which nominal debt reduces) is 
that it is utterly unjust, it is screwing the lower income and working class, 
while feeding the rentiers (the parasites). The general solution is what even 
that toff Keynes knew --- governments are monopoly issuers of their own 
currency, so can always choose to cancel debts that the poor cannot hope to 
repay (it was imposed upon them by fraud or "banksters", though some 
households are also simply idiots who succumb to the fraud, sadly). Being run 
by-in-large by the oligarchy (the supreme rentiers) governments choose not to 
help the poor. It's a political choice, it's always about willingness to issue 
currency, not capacity to --- since governments cannot run out of their own 
scorepoints, aka. "dollars", or yen, euro, pounds, peso, whatever.  All are 
scorepoints on balance sheets as far as governments are concerned, it's not 
backed by gold, it is backed by power to enforce tax liabilities.

Thus you see the guts of almost all economic injustice is the government is 
not providing the necessary incomes which are the only way households can pay 
the imposed tax liabilities and still satisfy savings desires.  For that, the 
government has to issue more net currency (preferably by hiring people do do 
public good work, and that is limitless, you cannot ever run out of public 
good work, not even with a billion ai bots), and they always can without 
causing inflation. (Governments do not get their own currency originally off 
taxpayers, that'd be counterfeit by the taxpayer, nor do they borrow their own 
currency, bond sales are interest rate maintenance operations, not borrowing 
operations.) 

The tax return is the automatic stabiliser --- tax return automatically rises 
when the government deficit (accumulating to historical debt) rises.  Over 
time, a growing population must have a growing money supply, so the government 
issue has to grow, not balance. (The debt ceiling in the USA will always rise. 
Or you'll has severe deflation, which hurts the poor the most so is profoundly 
regressive (their past debt grows nominally compared to income under 
deflation, while savings of the rich grow nominally compared to their costs.))
