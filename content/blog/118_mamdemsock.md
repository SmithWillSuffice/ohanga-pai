## Spooky SocFash-Entanglement Notes

☭🇻🇳 - 💖 - ✠︎🗽 From Bertleman's Socks to BerniMams Socks. 

Maybe I should just quit ‘Merican politics? But the end 
times of such concerns is pretty darn amusing — from a safe several tens 
of thousands of kilometres distance (∞ apologies to all who are getting 
terrorized by ICE and the IDF, sheesh). So it is hard to refrain from manic 
laughter, since that’s in times of state terrorism my only antidote.

When the pseudo-fascist kisses the DemSoc avatar’s Ring, does the Mamdani 
wait until after he leaves the office to wipe away the spittle? Or behave 
consistently with his ruthless honesty and wipe it off immediately? Are 
antiemetics involved?  Is the “tax payer” paying for those meds?

Whatever you say about the “controlled opposition” like the quasi-estab 
DemSocs, it was pretty glorious to hear Mamdani without hesitation say 
to MSNBC or whoever it was (paraphrasing): “Yes, I called Donald a fascist 
and a despot, and I stand by my statements, but we’re part of a system of 
government so must work together one way or another.”

This is the sort of character whom when DJT turns around and stabs him in 
the back it’ll bounce off him and poke Donald in the eye, like the Mamman 
is made of nanoparticle adamamtium springlets.  At least that’s my next 
Marvel film I produce in my private headspace. I wish I could let you all in 
on the premier screening, but believe me it’s a great service to you to 
keep you out of my influence orbit and qualia space.

Talk about spooky wallst-mainst Quant entanglement. If I measure populism 
UP at Alice’s station I’ll get populism DOWN at Bob’s. But everything 
is completely consistent and social-charge preserving.---


## Praxis

There’s got to be something useful to say and take-away from all this.

* I wrote to demsoc Influencer Harper whatshisname (Harper O’Connor), that 
you cannot expect the NYC mam-socialism to not turn to custard unless you 
comprehend the State currency operations. 
* NYC can either (1) run a local currency to guarantee full employment, (2) 
get a juicy government grant fund from the Mamdani-kissers, or (3) tax the 
properties/rents. Or all of the above.  But you cannot “tax the billionaires,” 
they (i) now how to evade, and (ii) know how to pass the cost off onto 
consumers and rent payers.
* The rent control has to be on other rents as well, not just housing. The 
rentiers are _socially_ stupid people but are not a bunch of “thickies”, 
if you see what I mean.
* To eliminate billionies one low hanging fruit to pluck is to stop 
issuing government bonds. But Mam-Socialism cannot legislate this. 
Mam-Socialism can however speak up about this like a decent Bernie Bro 
should, and ridicule Congress for being pathetic ignorant lusers.  All the 
more pathetic when they're raking in milliones of governemtn socrepoints 
from insider trading (Majorie blue-blooded-emaculately-tailored Greene).

### Demo of LLM Slop

LLM Bad. (Gemini??) <pre>“... its value comes from the trust and confidence 
that people have in the government that issues it, making it legal tender 
for transactions”</pre>   No!!!!!  Most state currencies are in insatiable 
demand due to imposed TAX LIABILITIES. Fiat currency is driven by imposed 
tax liabilities.  Not legal tender laws. Legal tender laws are almost 
never enforced. Tax liabilities are ALWAYS enforced (modulo tax haven evasions.)

File that under: “Having lots of government scorepoints does not make you 
any less a luser” department. It only makes you think you are a winner. 
(Shriveled little souls and all that.)---

## A Free Book  --- Also Useful

Here’s LaTeX PDF that I typeset from old ascii archives, of [Scott’s history _1951: The 1954 Watersiders Lock-out_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17h3NoyVJjnXIj6kNTV-NCK0dHb_JCEu_/view?usp=sharing). As relevant to today as ever. We have the power, not Mamdani and the bosses. Our power derives from the fruits of our labour, which does not belong to the bosses.
