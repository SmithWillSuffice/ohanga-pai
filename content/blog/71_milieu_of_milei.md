Ben Norton was on 
[BadFaith podcast (here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bid9grX8Wk) 
talking about Argentinian fascism, which masquerades as libertarianism, but 
is in fact merely neoliberalism.  People get all these things confused. 

Neoliberalism enables fascism, but is not overt fascism (worship of the nation 
as sacred, usually with policies when in power enforced by ramped-up police.)
Neoliberalism requires a police state and "security sate" for sustenance, but 
is not overt fascism, and often has fairly liberal doctrines such as gay 
rights, cosmopolitanism, and DEI policy.

Why does neoliberalism enable fascism? I should say "breeds fascism" --- it 
is because austerity economics always breed discontents who are happy to see 
an authoritarian remove the austerity. (Usually utterly false hopes since 
fascists do not grok MMT either.) In fact, such malcontents are justified in 
their discontent, but too often they settle for the disgusting complacency 
and low expectations of merely wanting to hear the authoritarian _say_ they 
will remove austerity. 

## Ben's Dummy Neoclassicism

I will not stoop to calling Ben Norton a neoliberal, because that'd be dumb 
and counterproductive, but he does still use a lot of neooclassical economics 
framing in his supposedly progressive leftist stances. He constantly employs the 
"tax payer dollars" myth. Oh our hard earned tax-dollars going to fund this 
war here or there.  It's laughable. Those are government issue dollars, they 
can be used to pay taxes, but they are not the dollars of the tax-payer that 
are funding the wars.

Such "tax payer funded" mythology feeds the fascists and is right-wing 
talking point fodder. It is disgraceful.

I suspect Norton borrows (like a neoliberal with currency) his own thoughts 
on MMT from Michael Hudson. The trouble is Hudson does not fully grok MMT 
either. Hudson talks in terms of realpolitik, so he has the framing where 
people do _think and believe_ tax-payer dollars are funding the government. 
This is true, people do think that, and it drives neoliberal policy.

But you, we, everyone who is honest, need to start talking about what 
is _possible_ and what the true available policy space open to a government 
is, free from ideology. Because only )then_ can we learn how no tax revenue 
is needed for free healthcare and affordable green state housing, and free 
education, and whatnot. The constraints are available real resources, not 
currency, not inflation.

Do not listen to Stephanie Kelton (but vote for her for POTUS if she runs). 
She will talk about the "inflation constraint" which is again false 
psychology, it is not pure MMT. An MMT understanding tells you the source of 
the price level, and thus also how to keep it stable. Inflation is not an 
economic concern for an MMT analysts, the real resources not being produced 
are the _only_ purely macroeconomic concern. Inflation is a political false 
psychology concern, and so a _real concern_ in today's political climate, for 
sure (gets you voted out of office if you do not loosely control the price 
level). But we have to start talking about options beyond such false 
psychology in order to make progress. 

I left these comments for BadFaith comments readers, LOL. First after Ben 
tried to explain why Argentina has hyper-inflation, starting with the lie that 
the USD is the "global reserve currency". That's the thesis of Hudson's 
_Superimperialism_, but it is not because of Bretton-Woods, which died long 
ago, it is because of false psychology. Bretton-Woods died${}^\dagger$, but the 
psychology of fixed exchange rate mentality did not.

(${}^\dagger$Although it can still be found... in New Hampshire.)

No foreigner needs US dollars.  That's the reality, but they _want_ US 
dollars. Not just to avoid forex fee costs LOL, but because of false 
psychology.

y comment:
> @13:00 rubbish. (1) USD is not a global reserve currency, but from false 
psychology ppl still think it is, so have insatiable demand for it (for 
little good reason, there are higher interest rates around). (2) when a 
currency is pegged (to anything else, gold or another currency) you must 
promise to deliver that which you peg to as redemption, rather than just 
redemption for tax liabilities. Without strong exports you cannot deliver 
on this promise, so to maintain the peg you need to borrow in huge amounts, 
and promise higher and higher interest rates to keep the bond buyers happy. 
This is directly inflationary. Neoliberals think high interest rates are 
disinflationary, but as usual they've got the money story totally backwards. 
Central Bank rates hikes are one-to-one pro-inflationary if the ratio of 
propensities of savers to borrow and borrowers to save is about 1, which 
it typically is --- higher CB rates just raise the forward prices and the 
own price, directly, not even a secondary market effect.  Read up on MMT 
from Mosler & Mitchell, not Kelton.

Ben Norton is good on anti-fascism and geopolitics, but on macroeconomics he sucks --- almost like a neoliberal --- "our hard earned tax dollars!" LOL.

## Other comments on Liberal versus Libertarian
 
 
### Someone in the comments section

There was a comment:
> "Bad Faith interview with Denis Kucinich was really good. 
I didn't know Milei wanted to put face recognizing cameras and banned 
protest. That's not libertarian."
 
I had to reply:
> Correct, but it *_is_* what a libertarian must always do. Armchair 
libertarians notwithstanding.  They have to choose between their policy 
options, because libertarianism is inconsistent with a government monopoly 
on the currency and law. But they can never do without a quasi-police state 
to enforce their policies. They inevitably choose the fashy elements that 
are anti-liberal because they prefer the (fake) "free market" aka. sell to 
the highest bidders (which is pro-inflationary, so... LOL)
