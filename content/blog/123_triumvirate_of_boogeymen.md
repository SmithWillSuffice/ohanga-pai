No, not the Google mafia of Schmidt, Page and Brin. The fake-democratic State, 
the security state and the mafia-deep state. Fighting Neoliberalism is 
hugely important, as Rob Campbell here notes (a few minutes in), since 
neoliberalism will not be an ideology or paradigm that disappears of natural 
forces.

These NZ Fabian Society talks were pretty good on the whole, but I think 
missing an analysis that extends Aaron Good’s/C Wright Mills’ theses to a 
little innocent country like Aotearoa. But more importantly, missing an MMT Lens. 

## The Missing Deep State Talk

Do we have a deep state? DO we have a clandestine service within a 
clandestine service? Does that even matter? I'd argue maybe it does not 
matter because too many NZ politicians and civil; servants are wedded in 
their own minds to the USA and the imperial West mind-meld aspects of the 
Europeans. All of which is antithetical to what I think most ordinary Kiwi’s 
think of ourselves as a “nation.”

We are pretty proud to think of ourselves as independent, but are we really? 
No, we are not.

Hence “defeating neoliberalism” is not a Kiwi project. It is a global project. 
Nevertheless, we should get rid of the neoliberals here anyway, to whatever 
degree we can do so, and that principally means educating the public about 
the most critical brainwashing that neoliberalism has accomplished, and that 
is the monetary system. It is not privatization. It is not user-pays. The roots 
of both those aspects of neoliberalism all stem from the primary core 
primitives of neoliberalism, which is that they have the 
[Money Sequence](https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/) backwards. 

Try proving me wrong on this!  You can’t. It all traces back to the money system. 

It is however true that the support for neoliberalism comes from all sorts 
of cultural factors, which trace to the entrenched aristocracies and little 
power fiefdoms via which the upper class gain and maintain undeserved 
privileges thereby. Most of this 
vanishes into puffs of working class righteous  rejection once the working 
class understand their “hard earned tax dollars” are not funding the 
government, hence neither are the rich ꕗ𖧥𖨚𖢧𖧥𖦪𖦧𖨚, nor the “Rothschilds.”

It’s all the exact opposite. The working class have the upper class clenched 
by the balls, we just don't know it. It is a tragic crying shame the 
NZ “Labour” party does not know it either. (‘Deficit reduction’ dumb-dumb 
hawks, same as the rest.)

Why do I claim so? It is because even a monopoly authority cannot sustain a 
war if the army refuses to fight. In this case we are talking about the 
Class War, but it applies generally. Is this too cryptic for you? 
In plainer language, government austerity policy (the main weapon in the 
class war) becomes impossible to sustain if the workers refuse to be in that 
fight by tolerating low wages and unemployment and swallowing the poisoned 
pill of NAIRU mythology (fear of the inflation boogeyman). 

The tragedy of our age (which goes back to goodness knows when, if I were 
an historian I'd probably say since antiquity) is that the workers have 
swallowed the educated elites lies, and believe the government debt is bad, 
and we cannot have full employment due to the Inflaton Boogeyman.[[1]](#fn1).  Looks 
like I’ve already segued into MMT. 

## Missing MMT Lens 

One comment in the livestream revealed a bit of the dopiness on “the Left.” 
Someone claiming we are “debt based” and “borrow from foreign banks too 
much.” As I often say, with friends like these who needs right-wingers?

All currency is debt and equally credit. We will always be "debt based" 
because we will always be credit based. The issue (for the Left, since the 
Right have it all their way at present) is who holds most of the government 
tax credits? The answer is the top Ten Percent, which is the root base 
injustice. 

If you want to be a real radical, then you'd be saying that no 
one should have more government scorepoint in their bank account than anyone 
else, up to a statistically insignificant purchasing power variance. It you 
know some MMT you'll also know such fair scorepoint distribution (aka 
government debt, aka private sector savings) is not antithetical to a market 
economy. It is antithetical to a capitalistic rentier economy. These two 
categories are not the same. A proper market economy might even be said to 
be incompatible with capitalism and rentier gangster based economy. With a 
proper definition of a fair market I'd say that is the case.

To see why, you must include the labour market = people desiring to exchange 
their labour for the tax credit. That “desire” is always coerced, so 
hardly “desirable,” but the government, a fair government, must undo that 
coercion by providing the workers with the claim a job guarantee from the 
state, allowing workers to do pretty much whatever the heck they desire to 
do to contribute to their local community — with a living wage and fair 
benefits. (If your “job guarantee” is not this, then it is ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ and 
should be scrapped, and re-legislated to be non-ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ.)[[2]](#fn2)

Almost obscenely for Fabians, this discussion was absent in that meeting. 
This was so depressing. A “Labour” government with a non-negotiable 
Job Guarantee in their policy platform would, I suspect, be unstoppable. The 
risk for conservatives here might be such a political movement would likely 
become near monopoly democratic power. But of course, that’s what should 
happen!  The key is that the government not supporting labour is already a 
damn monopoly, since we do not get our tax credits from foreign banks or 
the private sector.

Thus since government is always a monopolist, you want government to at least 
be on the side of labour, since labour is whom we get our milk and bread 
from, both literally and metaphorically.

What does this tell you?

It tells you a genuine labour movement cannot be a party[[3]](#fn3) of the liberal 
well-educated elite and “freedom loving” libertarians. No. A genuine labour 
government must be a government for all people, including right-wing 
conservatives.  Political ideology euthanasia being “not a thing”.[[4]](#fn4) You 
do not have to love a right-winger, but you might. You might even marry one. 
We have to live together in any case, and creating ideological sectors in a 
society, either geographically or intellectually, is not healthy, and erodes 
democracy, and promotes “team sport” politics. Any genuine Leftie should be 
dead against this liberalism—conservatism teams sports split. A true leftist 
supports conservatives too, if they are working class conservatives. We need 
all people as (distant, arms-length?🤣) friends and allies to combat 
injustice, even if they have horrific racial prejudices and gun-totting 
ballyhoo. No racist was ever cured of their brain disease be being isolated 
from kind people. You (the dirtbag left) do not have to love their cultural 
preferences nor have a beer with them after work. But it is good to have the 
odd beer with them after work.

<span id=fn1 style="color: dodgerblue">[1]</span> <span>At some point I need to write an article dedicated to the Inlflaton Boogeyman, so I do not have to repeat myself. The metaphor is the cosmic explansion, called the Big Bang. Old models that are now ruled out used a fictional quantum scalar field called the Inflaton, to try to account form cosmic smoothness and isotropy. This model is now all but ruled out, so is indeed a fiction. Just like the NAIRU inflatin hysteria nonsense is also fictional. When the bid for labour from the private sector is zero, the government can always hire at any minimum wage rate without inflaiton risk. The legal minimum wage being the floor wage, so a price anchor. Stability. Hence not inflationary. This is also known as the “Job Guarantee” in progressive politics, but really it is just a counter-cyclical stabilization policy that is natural and really should be a no-brainer, it reverses the policy mistake of a government imposing more tax liabilities than the government was willing to redeem (aka. unemployment).</span>

<span id=fn2 style="color: dodgerblue">[2]</span> <span>Personally I favour the policy of _Le Salaire à Vie,_ but you really almost tautologically need a socialist government to get that sort of policy, so it’s a pipe dream for now.</span>

<span id=fn3 style="color: dodgerblue">[3]</span> <span>Though, as I have written about before, I despise all political parties. Political partisanship is a cancer. Historicalyl at least an anachronism, which might once have been justified (before widespread news media and search/discovery).  But (counterfactually) with decent government that has local community authority autonomy of some degree, we never did need a high degree of news media coverage, since local politics is person-to-person discoverable.</span>

<span id=fn4 style="color: dodgerblue">[4]</span> <span>Though I would be prepared to make an exception for fascism and neoliberalism, if I had a magic one-time wand that could obliterate those thoughts in all minds in our cosmos, or all cosmologies. But spiritually, the capacity to think ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ thoughts is a good thing, it is how the soul grows — by cultivating avoiding such ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ thoughts. No capacity for ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒꕯꖡꔇ means one is either a God, or spiritually dead, an automaton.</span>
