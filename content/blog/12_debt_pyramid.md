It is very painful listening to Perry Mehrling's MOOC on Money and Banking.
 
Today the pain concerns the so-called money pyramid.
 
## Money is Credit --- there is no pyramid...
 
Also *all money is debt* because credit is a promise to be redeemed, so is the debt 
of the issuer.

All money is an IOU of the issuer, the problem is getting others to accept it. 
However, a "money thing" (an IOU) is <span style="color: #ffff66;">*as good as gold*</span> if the issuer always backs up 
their promise to redeem.  "Why would they not?" I say.

They *might* not if they were frauds. But there is no need to be a fraud. 
I can issue an IOU and promise to redeem for hugs. I will not default. If I was 
the cuddliest thing in the universe my IOU would circulate pretty well I imagine.
 
In fact, a legal IOU is way better than gold.  Who says anyone around will take your 
pinch of gold dust off your hands in exchange for bread? The baker cannot pay their 
tax liabilities with that gold duct, and they don't make tasty croissants with it, 
it is more or less useless to them absent the hassle of a gold exchange desk 
six townships away or wherever.

The top of the credit stack (or inverse, bottom of the debt stack) is the currency 
or IOU that is most probable not to be defaulted on.  What could that ever be I wonder?

You do not know. But a stable government in a peaceful country, with fair rule of 
law, will have the highest power money, a tax credit. They will always redeem, unless 
"politics" dictates they default to scumbags and nations they want to piss off (in 
which case they're not a very wise government, and not too peaceful). This tends to 
be the preserve power if imperialist nations, who have big armies and spooks to 
enforce debt upon other nations (IMF, World Bank goons).

However, no nation should cede currency sovereignty (the public monopoly on the 
currency) and so no country should ever be borrowing another's currency, so those 
international debt obligations should be of no concern to governments, they are 
matters between private sector actors. Or they should be. We all know today and in 
the past many nations were forced to depend upon a foreign currency. Hopefully more 
MMT education will gradually tear away those veils of ignorance.


## ... But There is a Pyramid

Because misunderstanding and inhumanity and greed exist in hearts and minds, even 
blindly institutionalized, the credit implicit in any IOU is often not redeemed. So 
it is possible to roughly compute probabilities of redemption for various IOU's.

By such analysis most state currencies (the tokens of bank account records thereof) 
are the most high powered money, because governments *almost always* redeem. Governments 
only default to people like terrorists or those they deem to be terrorists or as 
<span style="color: #ed872d;">Agent Orange</span> might say, "really bad, horrible, really bad guys."

However, estimating probabilities for chance of getting IOU's redeemed is not 
something I, or anyone I know, devotes any time towards. There is another reasonably 
sufficient way to calculate the debt pyramid, which is by the law of the land.

Legal systems will often have braid coverage of debt obligation law, as part of the 
Torts, or contractual law.

If you are foolish enough to accept someone's debt (their IOU, so you are the 
creditor, they are the debtor) without a legally binding contract backing your claim on 
them, then, well, yes, you are a fool.

People who buy stocks in publicly listed companies are into total fools, but just a 
little bit foolish. They might know the risks. A stock is a debt of the firm issuing 
the stock, they'll incur certain, legal obligations to their stockholders. But a 
stockholder is not guaranteed redemption at par value (the price they bought at) as 
we all know. It's a gamble. The better investors compute the odds of the stock price 
moving, and make their trades accordingly, lowering the risk, and increasing the 
value of the particular IOU's (stocks) they hold.

However, for one stock trader to make more than a market average return, some other 
stockholder has to lose, it is a zero sum game. Which means stocks are low chances of 
redemption in many cases.  On average they might redeem at par, but due to price 
volatility there are lots of winners and an equal number of loser in between.
(Usually more losers, due the subtraction of transaction fees.) 

So to win at playing stocks you really should be either out-smarting half the others, 
or just relying on dividends from the *real* growth of the company you invested in, 
not rely on trading. The latter is I suppose the Warren Buffet method. Don't quit 
your day job until the dividends are paying your rent, electricity, taxes and 
groceries.

Did I mention we are not a *get-rich-quick* provider?


### The Contractual Debt Stack

Most nations have laws determining who gets paid first when a company is forced to 
liquidate. If a government gets liquidated there is no such law, since it would have 
been law of the deceased government, so we only need worry about private debt.
However, since risk of government collapse is these days low, we can consider the 
most high-powered credit to be government debt.

Government debt consists of all the following:

* cash and coins.
* Treasury bonds (and other notes of the government).
* insured bank deposits.
* term deposits.

In some countries bank deposits are now 100% insured by government, in the USA it is 
100% but only up to $250,000, but that is pretty good. So all three of the above are 
at the top of the pyramid --- they are the most honoured IOU's you can find, 
differing only *between nations* and upon your police or Interpol mug-shot.
they also obviously differ in liquidity (how available they are for your spending). Cash 
most liquid, cash-deposits next, term-deposits and Treasury bonds next.

What people refer to as "the national debt" could be construed as all of the above 
--- all private wealth denominated in the state's unit of account (dollars for the US, 
yen for Japan, &c.).

But for the political comic theatre (tragically with horrific consequences for the 
poor) the "national debt" tends to be in the popular imagination just restricted to 
the Treasury Issue --- the bonds. That's because people falsely think this is 
"borrowed" from the private sector. It's not borrowed. Issuing Treasury notes does 
not change the net money supply, it is just a swap of non-interest earning cash for 
interest-earning Treasury bills. A drain on reserve assets, but an add to government 
liabilities = assets for the private sector holders.

Now for the interesting part. For contracts, when a publicly listed firm liquidates, 
the shareholder is, perhaps no surprises, *_at the bottom of the debt stack_*. 
They're the very last to be redeemed.

No wonder capitalists are want to tout "the shareholder" as so precious whom they're 
primarily responsible to, because they're the third class citizens here, yet the
capitalist needs them to believe they'll be redeemed somewhere up the top of the debt stack, to drive their capital.

It is true if the firm does have sufficient assets then the shareholders will get their 
final shares price worth when the firm liquidates, which might be pitiful, but 
better than nothing. But the creditors of the firm are at the top, those who loaned 
the firm cold hard cash. Usually bankers.

In New Zealand law we have the hierarchy:

<!-- Ref: https://www.mvp.co.nz/insolvency-blog/99-insolvency/947-conflicts-between-secured-creditors-and-shareholders -->

1. liquidator fees, expenses and remuneration
2. costs awarded by the court to the applicant creditor
3. costs awarded by the court to the applicant creditor
4. 'actual 'out-of-pocket' expenses of any liquidation committee
5. wages owed to employees for the four month period prior to the liquidation and all holiday pay and redundancy payments up to a specified maximum amount.
6. preferential taxes collected for inland revenue including gst, paye, employee deductions for child support and other taxes.
7. all other unsecured creditors (via law suits normally).

Quite a list huh, the shareholders at at the bottom. The folks liquidation at the 
top (lawyers and accountants) and the phreakin' government (tax department) is 
above shareholders!  That's insane. 

For a shorter short-list, for most countries:

1. secured creditors with specific securities
2. secured creditors with general securities are next in line. 
3. unsecured creditor --- the last groups to be paid following an insolvency.

Certain unsecured suppliers will have retention of the title claims, however these 
rank behind the registered security holders. By the way, you are unsecured as a 
creditor if you have not demanded any specific collateral for the money you loaned. 
For citizens getting paid in state currency you of course have the backing of the 
full force and power of the sovereign and Her army. That's why state currency is the 
most high-powered.

<!-- Ref: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredcreditor.asp -->

In New Zealand a shareholder could go to the trouble of registering under our 
Personal Properties Security Register (PPSR), which will give them credit stack 
status above others, equivalent to a general secured creditor. Harsh world huh? 



## Comparing with Mehrling's Stack

Mehrling thinks not of risk of default or probability of redemption, but in terms of 
what claims each type of money instrument has on another. To me that's just building 
a different type of stack, but not really getting to the nub of the purpose of a monetary system.

In this sort of scheme it does make *some* sense to put <span style="color: 
gold;">gold</span> at the top, but that really should be "gold" in quotes, since what 
people really want to be able to claim with their cash is food, electricity, rent, 
and ultimately tax payment of course, but the pragmatics say "food & coffee" should 
really be up the top --- whatever you cannot live without.

Mehrling does at least get the credit expansion/contraction picture correct in 
[Lecture-2 Part-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXVaY-gIahw). So at least 
implicitly he is saying all money is credit and $\Delta$credit = $\Delta$debt.

## Caveats

I have not got through the whole of Mehrling's course, so maybe at some point he 
says, "Ha ha! fooled you!"

If I've triggered you as a devotee of Mehrling's please email me with your concerns 
after [donating here](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/), 
I am happy to retract anything malicious and false. However, please do appreciate I 
like Mehrling as a teacher, I just thing he misunderstands the monetary system. 
He focuses too much on how people think it works (gold fever brains), rather than 
how it does work. This means he gets a lot of behavioural economics surrounding 
attitudes to banking and reaction functions correct, since in that respect he's just 
observing how people in an MMT system can still act like they're on a gold standard 
or fixed exchange rate.

We've discussed this a little on the 
[MMT Macro Trader podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/@MMTMacroTrader). 
How people acting in an MMT system "as if" it is a loanable funds system can do 
stupid things, which can make the monetary system look a bit like loanable funds, or 
fractional reserve banking (which are both false).

Also, read Scott Fulwiler, Eric Tymoigne, or Nathan Tankus for more nuance, I am 
sure they'd dunk on any fallacies I've made.
