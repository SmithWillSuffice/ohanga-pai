One good thing about joining 
[Douglas the MMT Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader) 
is that I get exposed now to trolls and critics who want to debunk MMT. This might 
be fodder for several posts, so this is a Part-1. I am not going to launch into 
esoteric philosophy and money crankery, so don't be scared. My approach is more 
mathematical. In the sciences, and let's be generous and call macroeconomics a social 
science (there is theory and empirical data to test it, just not always 
conclusively), so we can formulate definitions, and theorems using the definitions, 
and then test them. 

((If you think we cannot then you are on another planet like Yanis Varoufakis, and we 
cannot easily communicate my friend. Seriously though, what Yanis says is that we 
cannot replicate trials, so economics is not like other sciences. But social sciences 
have always been this way, you cannot lab replicate an entire human culture. Science 
is however not defined by "needs replicated control trials". RCT's are only one 
method available to a science, if RCT's are not available you have to test theories 
and models in other ways, which can be done, it is just not as easy. Besides which, 
RCT's are controlled, and the real world is often not, so RCT's cannot ever 
constitute all of empirics in science.))


## Is Economics a Science?

What Varoufakis gets correct is that a lot of professional economists are  in fact 
not engaged in any science. In this he would agree with someone like Steve Keen who 
would also say the mainstream Neoclassical school of economics is not a science.
What is it then? The answer is that it is a mathematical theory. If formulated 
consistently it violates common presumptions in the real world (real people are not 
rational, and have poor capacity to maximize their subjective utility (utility as a 
Neoclassical must non-circularly define it)). 

When it is formulated with idealized axioms the Neoclassicals *want* to believe are 
true in the real world the theory can in fact become inconsistent (neoclassical 
axioms imply there is *no* stable price vector${}^\dagger$). And so for these, and a few other 
reasons, Neoclassical economics is a fictional fantasy. If consistent, it is not 
applicable to the real world. If inconsistent then it is invalid in every possible 
world.

That is what you call a diabolical piece of mathematics and a waste of human 
intellect. Like String Theory that proves Strings are inconsistent.

${}^\dagger$See John Blatt *[Dynamic Economic Systems](https://www.routledge.com/Dynamic-Economic-Systems-A-Post-Keynesian-Approach/Blatt/p/book/9780873323062)*.

### Definitions Give Formal Semantics

The idea of a definition is to convey meaning, but this is only possible if we are 
communicating with some sentient conscious "knower". If not, then we are just 
formalising our thinking for ourselves, but that can be a worthwhile thing to do. 
Define what you mean, make it a record, then you can have what Wittgenstein thought 
was impossible: a private language.

If someone uses a different definition for a word, say "money", to us, then we have the possibility of needless debate and argument. I do not wish to engage in that sort of thing. So if you are going to communicate meaningfully with us as MMT aware activists, you will need to either accept, temporarily, our definitions, or lay-out your own and beg us to temporarily explore yours.

In MMT we have a simple enough definition of "money":

* **Money** is an IOU of the issuer. Whatever the issuer promises in redemption for the IOU dictates (perhaps subjectively) the *value* of the money (what it is worth to you, how much effort you will be prepared to obtain their IOU.)

Notice no such thing as a "bank" is yet mentioned. Money can indeed exist without 
banks, but an IOU does require some sort of record keeper, even if it is you keeping 
the record in your head. In the real world these are normally banks, or one of the 
functions of banks. 

We then have a new term to define, for *state currency* or 
state money:

* **State currency** is an IOU of the state, which for normative purposes MMT defines 
to be the *tax credit* (that which is accepted as redemption for payment of tax 
liabilities). 

The state owes you redemption of one unit of tax liability when you 
receive their currency tokens, this is *one* reason (among others, but the primary 
reason) why you accept the state's currency in payments.

((I am not talking about psychologically why you accept dollars rather than gold or 
bitcoin. Most of you accept dollars because "everyone else does" so to 
understand *that* you have to know the macroeconomics, because there is no way as a 
whole a society will accept worthless bits of paper for payments. The system as a 
whole "knows" something backs the state currency, and as soon as they learn it is not 
gold stored in Fort Knox, they realize it is pure state power. It is not by genial 
"social agreement". The state can use the gold as a fig leaf of course, to hide the 
naked reality of their fiat currency, should they feel the need to do so. An MMT'er 
would not need them too, enjoying the full naked splendour. Bloody perverts.))

The phrase "the money" is ambiguous, since it can refer to the tokens, or the account 
records, or the units of the records (unit of account). Provided you appreciate there 
is this ambiguity we will allow you to talk to us using the word "money" if it is 
clear enough from context which meaning you are employing.

With a few other definitions and axioms (simple postulates that we agree need not be 
proven) which I will not belabour by writing them all down 
(see [Theory](/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai)), 
MMT can now claim a few corollaries.

One is that it now matters a great deal whether you can get the tax credits *only* 
from government, or *only* from private banks, or both.
Because bankers can be tiny little assholes about their tightness on credit. Why? 
Because governments deem them insolvent if they cannot cover their liabilities (how 
frickin' dare that government encroach upon the beautiful efficiency of the private 
sector! All going and making the currency valuable and all.)

It matters also because if governments allow themselves to emit their own tax credits 
then the demos has some measure of protection from predatory bankers, and also the 
government itself is now not beholden to the pecuniary interests of private bankers. 
It seems to me this is sociologically extremely important!

((Note to Positive Money activists: why would a government --- as in *the 
**govern**ors* --- refuse to allow themselves the ability to issue their own tax 
credits? Why am I even bothering to ask the question!?))

MMT is thus not "merely accounting." 
[The Money Story](/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai#money_story), which is a political story, makes a huge f-ing 
difference. If you get it wrong you can get mired in austerity politics and all 
sorts of other abuses and crimes against humanity (allowing involuntary unemployment)
and all for no good reason but ignorance.

I can give you Warren Mosler's pithy summary of the Money, Treasury Bond, and Price 
stories, all in a nutshell, which is as succinct a statement that I can find pointing 
out MMT is much more than "mere accounting."  Warren wrote:

> It's \[MMT\] recognizing the currency as a public monopoly and the implications thereof.

To see the implications are truly profound you only need to dip your toe in the MMT literature, then you will see there is a whole lot of depth to that pool. You cannot grok it all in a day. Just at least take a look at [Mosler\'s Proposals here](http://moslereconomics.com/proposals/) for starters.


### What about "bank money"?

Let's see. Banks issue credit, which is *your* promise to repay, not the bank's. 
The bank allows you to create your own *official* IOU, and amazingly you can pay 
your tax liabilities with it! Even better, some idiot down the road running a 
grocery store will accept this and give you groceries for it! 
Aren't banks marvellous?

Also, the unit is the state currency, which means what the bank issues is always an 
IOU of the state (we are not talking about corporate paper here either, 
but even that is also denominated in the state's unit of account: "dollar", "yen", "euro",...)

So banks are offering you a YOM --- You Owe Me, which is functionally just the inverse 
of an IOU.  How the heck can they do this?

It is because they are licenced to use the state's unit of account. So when you take 
the bank credit, now being in debt to the bank, you are nonetheless in credit to the 
government, who will always accept your currency in receipt of tax payment.
This is why you can always use your "bank money" to purchase goods (why else do you 
take on the debt to the bank?).  A seller will take your filthy "bank money" because to 
them it is functionally exactly the same as clean green government issued currency. 
They may indeed pay off their tax liabilities with a fraction of your purchase.

The problem here is the commercial banking system, the private banks, are not the 
currency monopoly. So you can certainly pay off your tax liabilities, but then you still 
owe the bank, or they'll take your house off you (or whatever you implicitly or 
explicitly offered as collateral). 

But why? Why can the bank not pay itself?

Do I really have to say why? They are licenced and regulated *by the state*. Anyone heard of jail for fraud laws? Anyone?

So this is very different to the state's currency operations, but it is using the 
same unit of currency.

The bank cannot operate without the government around to impose liabilities that, 
by force, drive demand for the otherwise worthless state currency. They can then 
issue their YOM's, but only because the state permits this.

Now some MMT'ers say this means the private banks are acting as "agents of the state". 
This is true, but it is only a definition of what it means to be one type of "agent". 
People get all uptight and lose their marbles over this, but it is just a definition.
If you do not like saying banks are agents of the state, then call them something else. 
It does not change the reality of the monetary system operations.

Banks cannot function by issuing their own money. If they try to issue an IOU 
they'll pretty soon run out of takers. Try it yourself --- is a possible taunt (to every 
cryptocurrency nutter ever). 

((The tragedy of that is that the cryptocurrency early adopters did make billions, 
all at the expense of the late-comers. It was, and continues to be, a bit of a 
tragedy, like going to the casino, a tax on stupidity, but a big gain for borderline 
criminals and modern day Charles Ponzi's.))

The reason why banks are not running ponzi schemes (aside from the fraudulent 
bankers) is because they are government regulated, they must satisfy solvency and 
capital requirements, or the state shuts them down. This is very strongly enforced. 
One thing governments are finicky about enforcing (as with counterfeit). If the 
state loses this power, then Its currency demand drops to zero. But then so will the 
bank's.



## Why People Troll MMT --- Positive Money and All That

One reason we find a lot of trolls making rude or obnoxious comments on MMT related 
content on social media is because they are using different semantics, different 
definitions.

If you define "money" as the account records emitted by private banks, and only by 
private banks, then it is debateable whether this can be considered state currency.

However, if the state accepts the bank created records as redemption for tax 
liabilities, then the state is in cooperation with the private banks making it be so 
(by law) that the bank credit is state currency. Or, the state might say you need 2 
units of bank credit to redeem one unit of their tax liabilities. (They usually do 
not, but they could.) That would then be a dual money system, but trivially so, a 
conversion factor. You could very well just assume you have to pay double the tax you 
used to, denominated in the "private money" tokens. Total bananas, but I guess 
pigs could grab jet packs and fly.


### Trolling Over Definitions

People troll MMT because they think their definition is the one and only true 
definition.

It is a bit infantile, because definitions only matter when they are employed to 
theorize or model. So if you can come up with a model where the dominant monetary 
form in a region is the bank credit, issued *only* by private banks, and the 
governments are only getting in on the action by imposing tax liabilities denominated 
in the bank currencies, then you have some grounds to argue against MMT theory.

MMT says the state currency is a unit of account *of the state* created by the law of 
the land, not by banks. Banks can however obtain licences to operate credit 
facilities from the state. This is in fact objectively true, if one examines the law 
in any nation that has a state currency driven by taxation, and a banking payments 
system.

It is not only by law either, the old fashioned ledger books conformed, and today the 
software systems the banks use have to be licenced and they implement MMT operations, 
pure and simple. (This can be empirically tested, and it [has been](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2014.10.013).)

So now we have the opportunity for departures in theories based upon the definitions.

We can ask,

1. Do governments need to borrow credit from banks, which they have to repay with 
interest, in order to get the state currency into the government account books?
2. Why do banks allow the government to vote to issue more of the bank's currency? Or 
rather, why does a government with an army and police force permit private weakling 
banks to dictate the credit supply? To even pose these questions is conceding the 
principle! These are not applicable questions! You can ask them, but the answers are 
trivial.

The answers are that (1) governments never borrow from banks, and (2) governments never 
take orders from banks. It is the other way around. But if you want to appear insane, 
and test your sanity, we can examine the software and accounting law and practices 
and check to see if you are posing a sensible question. You will find you are not. 
Governments, of any reasonable sized population, *define* their currency, and 
*permit* banks to operate as private payments and deposit holding services. Like our 
bus system (in Wellington, New Zealand) which is publicly licenced, but privately run 
for profit --- they could not operate without our city council's approval.

((Philosophically, is a private public service provider really "in the private 
sector", or are they really in the public sector? The answer is, it depends upon your 
definitions. So do not be a nerd if someone says otherwise to what you think here. 
One definition: Public service contractors are in the private sector when they clock 
off work, and in the public sector when they are on the job if the government is 
contracting them. This might not be your definition. To see if it matters, you have 
to check what is legally enforceable: what workers rights do the contractors have? 
Are they civil service protections, or the private sector wild west?))

Notice we have already crossed over into MMT land, because we are talking about 
account records, not gold. Governments (most of them anyway) have no interest anymore 
in gold. Fort Knox in the USA viewed as a backing for the US dollar is a charade. It 
is a store of gold, that might be used for future space travel optoelectronics. But 
that is all. These days it never gets shipped around in any significant amounts to 
back any payments system, and this was signed by law in the 1930's when the USA 
stopped redeeming for gold domestically, then again in 1972 when the USA stopped the 
charade of Bretton-Woods (a quasi gold standard, but really based on the US dollar, 
but the USA was technically still promising redemption in gold up until 1972.  No 
longer.).

I will concede ground to our frenemy "Rob" on the comments sections${}^\ddagger$, that gold *is* 
moved around. How about that, people do elevator it up out of Fort Knox, and back 
down in a hole in the ground in Moscow.  Why the F? If it is not for an electrical 
engineering or high-end consumer electronics factory?

${}^\ddagger$I do not want to slander the real Rob, so I hereby make a strawman Rob, 
who I will name Niels Rob, or Niels Bor in Danish, or Niels Bohr. He takes the 
Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum currency (it's gold) and I am Einstein taking 
the realist account of state currency (a tax credit). Notice we are already stupid 
both, since we have different definitions. But the idea is to determine if there are 
real world consequences that can be tested, like the EPR experiment. (Bohr is 
considered to have won this debate, ok Rob?)  ((Apologies to physicists who would 
recognize I have Einstein and Bohr backwards in this analogy. Credit is entangled 
with debt. Gold cannot be entangled. But read my 
[T4GU pages](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/) to see why Einstein knew about entanglement 
better than Bohr in the ultimate end. ER=EPR my dudes.))

Partly, rubes need this charade that something physical (real stuff, man!) "backs" the 
currency. You know.... otherwise they might not find someone willing to purchase 
their wares. Someone's promising gold for redemption,... right? 

Satisfying the rubes is a time-honoured tradition. It is unknown whether Putin 
understood any of this. He might be one of those rubes thinking Moscow better stick 
gold under the ground or the rouble might collapse. The permafrost, you see. 
In any case, gold bullion *does* get shipped around from time-to-time to keep these 
rubes sleeping at night. I mean... the horror! What if people lost all the credit 
records??? Haven't you seen *Mr Robot?* You can't be a giga-chad if you do not own 
gold my dudes.

Ultimately though, there could be method to Putin's madness. If you have some idea 
the gold price is going to go up in dollar units, you can meddle with your foreign 
exchange rate by selling gold you bought cheaper with your currency (yen, euro, 
rouble,...).  Again I can give some battle ground to Niels Bohr here. If Russia 
desires a fixed exchange rate, and thereby signal they want to help their export 
oligarchs and screw their domestic workers over, than they'll try to maintain some 
foreign exchange rate target they decide is satisfactory for the exporters. This will 
not help them win a  military conflict however, so I really do not know what Putin is 
thinking. He has workers, energy, steel, they can make bullets. Why do they give a 
toss about the forex rate? They could be rubes. Or they could think this is a form of 
psychological warfare, because the foreign state officials also believe gold is 
currency rather than a buffer stock. Who knows.

It is possible some utter catastrophe could destroy all branches of the US 
government, then the IRS might stop functioning and the demand for the USD collapse 
to zero, and water or coffee beans or gold might become a medium of exchange for a 
while until a new government with tax authority and enforcement is formed. 
Before then Fort Knox *might* get raided, and whoever raids the most *might* find 
themselves as the new monopoly issuer of a private currency (records that it promises 
to redeem for gold). Adults not being adults and making misery for the masses.

I love, or love to laugh at, pedants who say this is why MMT is false. When exactly 
do they think the USA will collapse?  Sure it could happen, but until it does the US 
dollar system is well-described by MMT. Same here in New Zealand for the NZD. 
I mean seriously, when the Aussies run out of fertile soil and desalinated water... 
"We will fight on the beaches..."



### Trolling Over Positive Money

I class the [Positive Money](https://www.positivemoney.org/) cranks as a different 
sort of troll. They tend to have their hearts in the right place, but their 
conceptions of "money" are so poor they can be a hazard to the public good 
consciousness.

But here I have to create a strawman, because I have failed to meet a Positive Money 
theorist in the wild. I had one roped online for a day, but they gave up on me! 
Gave up on *me*!!!  Hell, I must be in a non-redeemable cult.

However, I am prepared to build this strawman out of 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Money). 
This one is for the UK, but substitute "Bank of England" for any central bank, 
and you get Positive Money for any country.

> Positive Money's historical backbone proposal is to introduce a "sovereign money 
system".  Under such a reform, private banks would be deprived from their ability to 
create money by extending credit into the economy. In turn, the Bank of England would 
regain the monopoly over money creation, by financing the government's budget 
(monetary financing) or distributing a citizens' dividend ("helicopter money"). The 
group however refutes any affiliation with Modern Monetary Theory.   
--- [(downloaded 2023-01-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Money).

They are right to refute affiliation with MMT, because MMT would say, "LOL! The UK 
already have sovereign currency," they just do not know it, and act like they do not 
have BOE created money. It is fair, I think, to say the UK monetary system looks like 
a private bank mafiosi, but appearances are deceptive. It is a bankers mafia only 
because the government wants it to be. Why does any foreign power accept the LIBOR? 

Warren Mosler's suggestion was to steer the Fifth Fleet up the Thames and tell them 
what the interest rate will be.

All private banks in the UK have all obtained their UKP equity from past UK 
government deficits. So "the money" all came from the UK government. It was never silver 
or gold.

The political issue the Positive Money activists have correct is that the UK monetary 
system is heavily influenced by the private banks and their credit creation 
authority.  That authority comes from the UK government, not the private bank cartel. 
But this is only legal business. It is the UK government permitting all these bank 
credit facilities to be operated on UK soil. (We are not talking about Shadow Banking 
here, which may also not be sufficiently regulated, but whatever Shadow Banking is, 
it is not credit creation, it is strictly loaning deposits, which is not bank credit 
creation.)

Thus if Positive Money activists are *only* arguing that the UK government should 
better assert it's actual existing power as a currency monopolist, to help stop lower 
income people from going into bank debt, then they can be affiliated with MMT, 
because all MMT aware people I know would agree that is the objective of all 
enlightened current activism over the injustices of the banking system (but you have 
to then also understand the MMT Job Guarantee to truly see the proper fix for the base 
problem).

Unfortunately, the (strawman) Positive Money activists go overboard with the 
conspiracy story[${}^\ast$](#fn1), and also fail to understand that there is always a 
debtor whenever there is a creditor, and so "positive money" is a fiction. You cannot 
create "positive money" it is an inapplicable notion, because *all money* is an IOU 
of the issuer, otherwise it is not "money".  The issuer has the debt obligation 
(promise to redeem) the receiver has the credit.


<a name="fn1">${}^\ast$</a> I do not quite see how a government that wants to 
empower private banks and 
credit creation, rather than government issue, is a conspiracy. It is at least a 
conspiracy conducted in broad daylight, and a crime against humanity (I am possibly 
even more insistent it is a human rights crime than the Positive Money people --- 
because I know the government does not need any new laws to stop the banker mafia). If 
you cannot see in broad daylight, how am I to aid you? 


If there is no promise to redeem you have not got a currency, you have a ponzi scheme. 
Like Bitcoin.


### Giving Back the Bank of England the Monopoly? LOL

MMT (and Law scholarship --- an _**integral** part of MMT_) reveals the central banks are already branches of 
government, and governments are already the currency monopolists. They regulate the private banks. They just need to do it better, so people in need are never in debt (a Job Guarantee policy). No private bank ever should have a seat at the JG policy table, the private bankers interest is in getting people into debt. That serves no public purpose unless a firm wants to be in debt (to expand their green sustainable business --- should be the rule, and here the Positive Money people would agree, hooray!).

Somehow the Positive Money theorists got the spurious idea in their heads that 
governments are beholden to private banks. Perhaps that is due to the perverse way 
the government Treasury Departments play smoke and mirrors to conceal the fact that 
*on the balance sheets* they are already creating currency, every time they spend. No 
private bank in sight. But in the USA at least, they put a private bank (bond dealer) 
in the middle of the road as a fake. This is truly how money creation by government 
is run.  It is a charade. the government *is* the currency sovereign, already.

We know the reasons for this too, it is ideological. Neoliberals and conservatives 
can never countenance the thought the government issues currency by marking-up bank 
accounts. They want rich people to be privileged, with the "tax-payer funded" myth (see Raúl Carrillo's superb piece [here](https://splinternews.com/the-dangerous-myth-of-taxpayer-money-1819658902) or [youtube discussion here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4F3fUr0HO8)).

To be fair, it easy to write the spurious notion that "governments are beholden to 
private banks" into your head --- simply read an orthodox economics textbook. Fake 
knowledge.

Yet, how the currency operations are abused matters, and I doubt governments 
wanting to abuse the monetary system would ever dream of voting in 
Positive Money proposals. This is the same criticism MMT "enjoys" --- even if MMT 
*describes* the system well, who is there to force governments to run a 
Job Guarantee and lower interest rates to zero? 
No neoliberal I know of, for damn sure.

If we thus want the Bank of England to use the monopoly power it already has in 
conjunction with the UK Parliament, we have to use the force of democracy, and an 
educated population, and presently that means understanding MMT. 

You can also take a look at the Positive Money proposals and see which seem reasonable, 
but they do not describe the fair use of the current monetary system, that is why they 
are "reforms", but they need no change in the existing monetary system!

The proposals,

* more targeted public investments,
* better accountability (eliminate fraudulent lending),
* green economy fiscal targetting (tax polluters, invest in sustainable firms),
* digital cash,

are all fine, I have no issue with them. But where the heck is the guarantee of 
employment for anyone seeking the positive money? What is the PM buffer stock?
Sparkling mineral water?

But it does me no good in the eyes of a Positive Money activist to tell them these 
policies could already be implemented. Any way you look at it, if the votes in 
Parliament are there, twill be done.

There is no need to hinder those votes by *also* asking for *other* crankery 
monetary reforms that try to turn "money" into something "positive" when money is 
always and everywhere has been, for over 5000 years, a record of credits and debits.

And I do wonder if the Positive Money people realize, their system would still be 
tax-driven, so their "money" would still be a tax credit, so their money would still be 
an IOU of the state, a debt of the state. A "negative" on the Treasury balance sheet.
(Or for you and me, an overdraft.)  Oh dear!  The integers!



### Bridging a Semantic Gap

There might be some semantics issues that can help overcome the argy-bargies between 
MMT activists and Positive Money activists.

* Could we first establish a definition: Credit = $-$Debt. Money = Credit. Money is a 
claim on real resources (you can pass it on in an exchange to someone who desires to be 
in credit).
* Then we can ask what the Positive Money people think defines "money" and their 
"positive".
* Bank reserves facilitate payments, but still a bit of a charade. (This might be hard 
to gain agreement upon, but the banking software is where we can go to see banks never 
lend their reserves --- even if they think they do, the software won't let them).
* Failing inspecting the software, some countries, like New Zealand and the USA, 
permit Freedom of Information Act requests (FOIA). We could use a few of those.

((Yah, getting a Positive Money activist on-board can take a while.))

In brief, there is no need for fractional reserve banking${}^\S$. There is a
need for accurate accounting (which is already performed) and so that only leaves 
the need to understand the monetary system and stop it from being abused.

It *is* being abused. Using an unemployed buffer stock *of human labour* is a 
human rights crime, by any fair account of the matter.

If not abused it does not need reform. The managers of the system are the ones 
needing the reform. If we do the Positive Money reforms, what's to stop the banking 
mafia from just getting government to give them other ways to screw over workers? So 
let's focus on the real issue, which is proper **_just_** governance of the existing 
monetary system. It is fit for purpose. The people presently running governments are 
not. But we can help educate them so they are, or the next generation at least. This 
will likely shut down our current DougBot project, requiring a reboot, since we'd be 
in a new regime. But I will not be complaining.


${}^\S$ Fractional reserve banking is an artificial self-imposed 
constraint on credit. Also known as artificial austerity. If Positive Money people 
have a defence to avoid needless austerity, then why the extra complication and 
rules that requires resources to enforce? I will admit I am a bit vague on why some of the Positive Money people want fractional reserve banking to be a thing.

## Caveats

Steve Keen defines *Credit* as rate of change of debt. I cannot honetsly tell if this is standard usage, it seems economists lack some standards.

If "Credit" on the FRED H.8 tables is the amount of credit isssued over a year by banks, then that's a flow, not a stock, it is the stock of money from bank credit divided by $1\,$year. That agrees with Prof Keen.

However, as an outsider to econ academia, I find this terribly confusing. 

What we should be talking about is *opposite* sides of a balance sheet or Godley 
table: entity $A$ has "rising credit" equals entity $B$ having "rising debt" 
not just "debt". 

But in macroeconomics debt is a stock. The *government debt* accumulates year on year. 
It is the *government deficit* that is the flow ($\Delta$Debt$/\Delta t$, with 
$\Delta t $ = $1\\,$year.)

When a bank debits an account it always credits another, by the same amount. No rate in 
time is involved. And is I have state notes then I have a tax credit,, not a flow of anything like a wage.  Wages are rates of change of my tax credits $\Delta$credit$/\Delta t$.

The interest rate and the time span of the credit factors in a time dimension. 
(You have to return the credit after some time.) But in this case debt should also 
be a flow too, not a stock, if you want to be consistent. 

Having "'credit" be rate of change of another's debt would then conflict with 
what I believe is standard semantics for the government sector. Government 
deficit (or surplus) is the flow. Government debt is the accumulated deficit over all 
time, a stock = all the outstanding tax credits. 

**MMT Usage:** 

This is just my vote:

* Credit $=$ $-$Debt. 
* $\Delta$Credit = $-\Delta$ Debt.
