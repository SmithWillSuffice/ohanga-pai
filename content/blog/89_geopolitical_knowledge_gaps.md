Here Danny Haiphong talks to 
[India and Global Left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp_nNeSqEW8)
perpetrating macroeconomic myths. This is not good.
However, I am being picky.
Mostly I like listening to Danny's takes on geopolitics. But like a few other 
_geopolitical webcasts who shall not be named_${}^\dagger$ he gets monetary 
economics completely backwards sometimes.

${}^\dagger$But check out the excellent 
_[The Burning Archives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK6tOFidLVs)_.

Is it too "extremist MMT" 🤣 to write "_completely_ backwards" there"? 
Probs. But I'm going for complete alienation here!  It's a Ministry of 
Silly Walks Strategy.
The one person with "millieeeeeons" of dollars and a twisted mind who agrees 
with me might give me an annual pittance stipend to continue writing for 
their personal weekend pleasure.


## Aren't the Myths Stealthy?

Is there a case for the noble "White Lie" here?${}^\ddagger$ 

I think not. I think quite the opposite. An informed electorate is 
one which never needs to fight fascism in the street in the first place.
Remember the Weimar lesson. Fascism feeds off many things, but one big 
tasty junk food meal for them is public ignorance of macroeconomics. 
Thatcher's "tax payer funded" myth helps them. It is the antithesis of 
a leftist noble white Lie. I do not know any leftist noble white lies.

${}^\ddagger$Holy smoke, can you taste the irony? 

Using the "tax payer dollars are funding this" myth is 
just right-wing, period. It does not mean _you **are**_ right-wing. It just 
means you are unwittingly enabling their neo-reactionary monarchist 𖨚𖦙𖥣𖢧.

Today it is the petrodollar myth, one of the puny little boys of leftist 
myth-making. I guess you could say it does not detract too much from the 
main points Danny and the host were making, but I would argue it does!

Why?

Because having a good moral geopolitics and macroeconomic justice frame is a 
good thing, but it is tragic if you cannot explain to people why US/Western 
hegemony and political dominance is based largely on quicksand. It can all 
disappear under (without harming any US citizens, except _in relative terms_ 
the top One Percent) very rapidly. We are talking maybe even months. But it 
would require everyone to understand the monetary systems of 
central governments.

While it helps keep me busy in vain trying to educate people on MMT from 
a spiritual point of view, I still do not like the tragedy of it all when 
the Left shoot themselves in the head (more on this in a sec.) even if the 
bullets are nerf balls.


## The Good Ol' Hegemonic Petrodollar

The politics of oil is very frickin' bad and nasty, and so important. But 
maybe all the more reason why I do not appreciate myths being peddled. 
Even when hearts are in the right place. 
They distract from the real core rot in geopolitics, which is stuff like 
unnecessary crap, pointless energy consumption for the sake of "growth" for 
no particular reason. (The reason given is "falling rate of profit" 
otherwise, which is ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ.)

We survive today because of oil. We cannot do without it near-term, 
without oil the working class would tomorrow be living in darkness and 
starvation. We can stop burning the stuff if the leftiepol engineering 
got cracking on building nuclear and geothermal power utilities. But this 
cannot remove our modern dependence on oil. We need oil for chemical 
feedstocks. Weaning off oil is not simple thing. The politics of oil will 
thus still be with us probably long after climate catastrophe is averted, if 
it can still be averted.  I say “probably” because there is a good case to 
be made that oil politics is so closely associated with climate crisis that 
to solve the latter would mean eliminating the nasty stuff about the 
former. (I do not mean to incite defeatism here!)

When the host mentioned the "petrodollar" I had my say in the comments. 
It is perhaps a minor issue but you can judge for yourself the weight of false 
psychology. I personally think understanding why the petrodollar is a myth 
is an important part of any nation's knowledge bank for avoiding dependency 
on the USA.

I wrote to India and Global Left:
> [@12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp_nNeSqEW8&t=720s) 
there is no such thing as a petrodollar. Not that it is the worst 
myth of normie macroeconomics, but it isn't a good one either. What do you 
even mean by the term for a start? We in New Zealand import over half our 
oil, we mark-up the exporter's bank account in NZD. They convert to their 
currency. Same for anyone. The Saudis desire USD because they do not 
understand their own currency and desire extremely low taxes. With bare 
minimum taxation they cannot use the riyal for domestic full employment 
without incurring inflation risk. So they use the foreigners currency to 
get imports etc. without politically intolerable inflation of riyal 
denominated prices. But it is just a convoluted way to ensure 
decent _real terms of trade_ but with all the overhead false psychology, 
which is not good, and miss-fires people's geopolitical neurons. 

I continued:  
It distracts attention of activists from what US hegemony really derives 
from. In fact it contributes to aiding US hegemony. If you buy in to the 
common rhetoric the US dollar is a "global reserve currency" and is what 
enables the USA to be hegemonic economically, you simply do not understand 
reality. The USA needs people to be completely ignorant on the monetary 
system. If people understood what the US dollar is, they'd not have a bar 
of it, and the IMF/WB would be completely defanged — without anyone in the 
US Congress lifting a finger to help us.
      
(I skip many nuances of realpolitik, but that's all a youtube comment 
can offer, you need to research this stuff yourself properly and not 
regurgitate normie economics myths.)

I'd just say sprinkling around the phrase "petrodollars" like it means 
anything (other than "false psychology") is incredibly stupid and shows a 
lot of ignorance and laziness which is tragic.

I added for sarcastic emphasis,

> If you can weld steel and erect timber and pour concrete out of USD 
scorepoints in a FED TSy account, then yes, you can build beach property 
with USD earned from selling oil.  No workers or machines in sight, 
right?  Magical thinking.

I know that's a bit juvenile, but I honestly think sometimes such 
obvious things need to be stated, even though the comedic irony score 
is low.  I am sure I need people to hit me over 
the head sometimes too when I stray from my topics of expertise. 
((Look: The Barbie movie (2023) was not anti-capitalist.  Radiohead are 
mathematically provably the greatest artists of all time. I am pretty sure 
I am right about the Barbie movie. But I did not see it, so... not my 
expertise. I have no aesthetic expertise in music composition at all, but 
I can still mathematically prove the statement about Radiohead.🤣))


### Why the "falling rate of profit" is ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ

I thought that remark above might trigger some lefties, so I think I 
should defend myself. If you focus on profits denominated in the State 
unit of account then you are being misdirected. Call it a CIA Op, even 
though the CIA do not do a thing for this one.  It is an autoleft-psy Op.

What rapacious capitalism does, and is doing, is causing breakneck 
production of a lot of crap, but also rapaciously nice things like 
smartphones, villas and golf courses, and also slightly cool but 
terrifying things no one ever needs 
like trips into low Earth orbits, and whatnot. And it matters not whether 
one damn iota of any of this generates monetary profits or not. It is 
generating ecological debt, period. Real debt, and the currency has nothing 
to do with it. And while the working class do not get their fair share, 
we should not want a share in the fruits of rapaciousness.  A nice 
eco house next-ish to a golf course is good enough, I do not need to 
own the golf course, no one should.

Total ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗𝔰 (a Gaelic technical word) will use any unit of account for 
this, they just do not care. You have to appreciate how workers get 
soooo badly exploited it is worse than you can ever imagine. 
"Not even funny" does not even capture it. 

People lack a capacity to comprehend the difference between one million 
and one billion, mainly I think because adding three zeroes seems 
psychologically like a small step. "I can get there too one day with my 
bank account!"  No you can not!

This is why I gagged recently when 
[Kim Stanley Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKrBM7gEz7o)
almost seemed to give Bill Gates the "autism out" excuse. Like being a 
nerd excuses the incapacity to realize one is exploiting workers for 
one's own gain?
(I'd be slightly more ok with the "Freud excuse" --- his daddy was a 
total ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗, or 90% ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗, and instilled total ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗 values in young Bill.
Only 90% because the Gates neurons seem to have been trained on data 
to realize taxes can be a good thing and not to fund government but because
rich ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗𝔰 are too damn ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗-ridden.)


## More Tragedy from Yanis

Again, I believe I am being thoroughly nit-picky. But I still think a case 
can be made that this sort of false information, even though seemingly 
innocuous and "innocent" does the Left harm, needlessly. It's not like 
(imagining I am in a position of power and influence 🤣) that I am 
demanding a purity test. I just don't want to hear any stupid 𖨚𖦙𖥣𖢧 from 
people I respect and admire. 

You know, because you need to prepare your heroes so when you meet them 
they do not disappoint.

[Hereabouts Yanis does a good take-down of cryptocurrency](https://youtu.be/YpR9tRtpz2k?t=190) 
and libertarian general nonsense. But right at the end he slips in, 

> "Money can never by anything other than _State_ money."

Doh! 🤦🏽  What are you doing Yanis?

If you want the _Extremist MMT Handbook_ concept of "money" (which is 
the One true concept), it is:

> **Definition:** _Money_ is everywhere and always an I.O.U of the issuer. 

By _this definition_ Yanis was fibbing.

However, for those experiencing a bit of cognitive dissonance, Yanis is 
not wrong in practical terms for _geopolitics_. At the geopolitical level we 
are talking the _only_ currencies of any importance are State currencies. 
The rest of what Yanis said was true, but I would have said it in much 
stronger terms --- because I _can_ --- Yanis cannot, since he is dim. 
I can say,

> Crypto is not even currency! 

What _is_ crypto. It can be many things to many people, but _essentially_ 
crypto is a certificate for solving a completely useless hard math puzzle.

All the rest --- ponzi scheme; means for rich ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗𝔰 to siphon money off 
suckers; means for a few lucky ꕗꗇꕷꖡꗇ𐝥ꕒꕷ to delusionally think they can get 
rich quick and actually luckily do; a black marketeers dream token; a drug 
dealers way to avoid needing a Caymans Island bank account number; a way of 
accelerating climate change;... are all also true to some or varying degrees 
on a case-by-case basis. Where is any of the _liberation_ in any of this?

Also, damn it! It really frickin' annoys me when lefties laud 
"The Blockchain" --- as Varoufakis does. I cannot say politely how stupid 
that is. The Blockchain is not an awesome algorithm nor fantastic pinnacle 
of 20th century ledger software engineering, it would not rank among the 
top 1000 most useful algorithms. It is anti-human.

Anything good you can do with Blockchain ledgers you can do far better, 
with better outcomes, with more decent incentives, by trusting people and 
in turn being honest. It is not rocket science or deep mathematics. (Although 
trustworthiness and honesty cannot even be mathematicized, so are deeper 
than deep mathematics, but the point is, it comes to human beings naturally 
without great effort when we are not living in precarity.)


### Apologies

I have lost the energy to expand on the thesis that getting small 
little things wrong about monetary systems is actually a frickin' huge 
deal, and is leftism shooting itself in the brain. It is not (yet) leftists 
shooting ourselves in the heart.  I understand _that_, and that might be 
a good place to finish today.

Things in Left spaces could get to the heartless place though, and I worry 
a lot about this. Once you give up on realism and start imagining magical 
revolution in your head, and imagining your utopia is the only good one, 
and imagining money does not matter, you can get to heartless places. Part 
of the spiritual condition is valuing wisdom over raw knowledge. The 
knowledge is however still needed, it is wise to acquire knowledge. It is 
then in a real sense heartless to try to foment revolution without wisdom 
about what _you and your army_ are going to do about **records of 
social obligations**.

(Think I am making too much of this? _Extremist MMT Handbook_ dude!🤣 Get 
it on your <strike>Amazon Kindle</strike> State Surveillance device today 
for only $9.99 petrodollars.)

You understand Ōhanga Pai now?

Money is a spiritual concept. But no one realizes (bar a few amazing 
anthropologists and weirdo dirtbags like myself). Such ignorance is one 
needless source of great suffering.
