In casual talks with [Douglas MMT Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader) 
questions about what constitutes a "proof of MMT" or a disproof arose.


## Research Objectives

The DougBot project seeks to use MMT analytics (balance sheets and fiscal flow
essentially) together with neural network algorithms to predict forward prices on the 
more *macroeconomic sensitive* indices, like the SPX.

The motive does not need to be to make money ahead of the average market returns, but 
(we think) more importantly to show the monetary system, which underlies the financial 
sector, is an MMT system, even if the traders do not like it! So an educational 
project.

To get such "proof of MMT we'd be also looking to predict (or retrodict, which is 
just as valid) movements in unemployment and tax flows. For this 
[The Sequence](/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/#money_story) 
of MMT is getting tested. 

Do governments issue currency effectively first, tax it away later, or the other way 
around? Just looking at balance sheets from a single starting point in time 
*today* cannot ever prove this Sequence, because you are not using the appropriate 
initial conditions. (Who first emitted the first currency records?)

The latter question could be considered "lost in the sands of time" if you think 
Benjamin Franklin's or Susan B Anthony's mug-shots have nothing to do with 
"government". (See, we are prepared to give Austrian Kindergartners a lot of rope.)

To test a sequence that has cyclical components that has no discernable $t=0$ 
stopwatch start, you need a method for determining differential motions within the 
cycle.

This is extreme sort of "proof" --- like saying to some joker, "Hey, suppose you 
are right that anti-gravity inertia free propulsion exists. Now let's see if that 
shadowy thing yonder that looks like a shadow, is truly accelerating 
instantaneously..."

While this could be construed as violating Lerner's Law (never concede the principle) 
this is ok, because we're only doing it as an internal part of our project. In public 
debate we'd never concede the principle. It's always just a Null Hypothesis: 
"suppose New Keynesian assumptions are true."

Or, if it suits your data better: "assume MMT operations are the reality."
There are then some things you can do to test these hypotheses.


### Testing the Sequence

Imagine then we are total idiots and have no thought of looking at the legal system, 
how could we show the MMT Sequence is the reality, rather than the alternative Null 
Hypothesis of pure endogenous money (government has to borrow or tax)?

One way is to examine the software of the troika of Treasury -- Central Bank --- Money 
Market operations when the government spends. Randall Wray and others have already done 
this, and they show governments do in fact issue or create new currency when they spend.
There is no borrowing or taxing involved.

However, this is too smart alecky for us. Suppose we were truly dumb Austrian 
Kindergartners and refused to regard the Central Bank as a branch of government.

Well, in fact Randall Wray's balance sheet analysis *still* shows that the money is 
issued by the Parliament/Congress, not the Central Bankers. The Central Bankers are 
just scorekeepers.

Again, too smart aleck by far. We might want to be very knuckleheaded and even pretend 
we never read Adam Smith's observations about "the Colonies" emitting "paper money" and 
then "burning it upon receipt".

OK, so now I think we would be backed into the toughest corner to "prove MMT". 
Finally. The only resort such knuckleheads would have is to look at impulses during 
the fiscal cycles.

The shorter time interval has to be found from,

* (step-$1$) government spend, to (step-$2$) real output growth,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then,  
* *also* the shorter time lag must be from ($1^\prime$) accelerated increasing 
general tax returns to ($2^\prime$) downward price and employment movements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and,  
* *also* the shorter time lag must be from ($1^{\prime\prime}$) increasing employment to 
increasing rate of FICA tax returns then a lag to ($2^{\prime\prime}$) stalled price and 
downward employment or stalled wage movements.
* *also* the shorter time lag must be from ($1^{\prime\prime}$) increasing government 
spending to ($2^{\prime\prime}$) higher savings rates for households and firms 
(not the other way around).

The third sequence recognizes FICA tax is regressive, it penalizes work, and so is a 
major component of driving the *small cycle* of wages against profits (the 
predator-prey mini cycles in macroeconomics). The price tends to never go downwards 
too much, instead the wage bill will tend to be what suffers if tax return accelerates.

I mean this is really tying our hands behind our backs and nailing our shoelaces to 
the floor boards level of stupidity. But we are prepared to do it for all our 
Austrian and Neoclassical Nursery School friends.

Note that the requirement for the "shorter lag time" means we cannot go beyond a 
fiscal cycle, otherwise the order of monetary operations (and hence their effects) 
can get thoroughly confounded, and the data can be manipulated to appear in any 
arbitrary sequence within the cycle.

If the sequence is, 
$$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D 
$$
then we seek shorter time lags $\Delta t(A,B)$ than $\Delta t(A,C)$ (otherwise reject 
the Null Hypothesis). If the actual dominant lags are longer than a cycle, so, for 
instance, rate of change in tax return $2$ years ago has a stronger impact on 
unemployment than rate of change in tax receipts $1$ year ago, then the cycle is 
confounded and the proper sequence is indeterminable (without a lot more 
sophisticated analysis).


### Fooling the System without Fooling the System

You can have a system that runs by certain rules, but which when looked at purely 
empirically seems to not run by coherent rules.

Need an example? Consider Rugby: get all the equipment and trained teams et cetera, 
but then they all decide they "do not believe in Rugby" (too tankie-commie) and start 
playing football.
Interesting game, right. No tries get scored. Always a 0--0 draw. Even though plenty 
of "goals" are scored past the goalkeeper I suppose. (We are presuming the 
scorekeeper is only noting true Rugby scores. I guess the odd drop-kick might 
score 3 points.)

In a converse sort of example, imagine the rules are Newtonian gravity or general 
relativity, the system is our Solar System, but the rules you find are Ptolemaic 
epicycles. "Ha! We *made* the earth go around the Sun, suck on that Kepler!"

What about playing cricket with baseball equipment. It can be done. Pretty hard to
get clean bowled, so some odd scores again. You think you'll get 1 point for a "home 
run" but the cricket scorekeeper logs a 6. Babe Ruth: "What's going on here?" 
Don Bradman: "Lol!"

If you think a bunch of New Keynesians running the IMF and central banks is any 
different to these analogies,... maybe think again!

It can be a way to "understand" some of the craziness and chaos of financial markets.

How about anti-chaotic markets analogies? What if everyone suddenly became 
altruistic? What about if all chess games were suddenly played with legal moves but 
players refused to capture each other's pieces? You could only deduce half the rules 
from empirical observations.

The more stupid of these analogies are the ones that are more alike to having 
neoliberals run the apparati of government fiscal policy.

### Playing an Austerity Game with MMT Rules 

So this is what all neoliberals do, whether left-wing or right-wing or up-wing or 
down-wing, red-wing, blue-wing or green-wing, dirty-wing or clean-wing. I feel a Dr 
Seuss cartoon coming on.

If a numbskull who had no concept of rule of law, be able to then look at just the 
financial data and conclude it was not an MMT operations system?

Douglas said 'No!"

That's the stance that a screwed up game of chess is still bound by the moves of 
the pieces. 

I reckon, "Yes!"

That's the stance that a there is a poverty of input, and it becomes possible to imagine 
something non-MMT about the monetary system, even though underneath it is all MMT 
operations, down to the last tax liability and bank credit.

Which is it?

I suspect we'd find neither is entirely true nor false. There is in fact too much 
poverty of input without an understanding of the legal system and Parliamentary law. 
Which means, just examining balance sheet data, one would not be able to get a 
statistically significant score to separate some of the theories. MMT would just become 
one of many.

Suppose, for instance, US Congress decided once and forall *not* to raise the 
fictional "deb ceiling"?

There is a conditional: anyone failing to see this is a free vote of Congress would 
be perhaps unable to tell the system is fiat currency. They might be led to conclude 
bank credit constrains the government net spending. This would be despite the fact 
the monetary operations and software systems are still all in accord with MMT.

This is at least something to think about if the DougBot project "proof of MMT" is 
to be rhetorically successful, even if technically unimpeachable.


## Push and Pulls












## Steve Keen's "Proof of MMT"

What ProfKeen does is code up a system of ordinary differential equations using 
macroscopic identities (definitions) and balance sheet stock-flow relations (so 
accounting rules, obeyed by banking system software) and then he runs these models to 
"show" that a rising government fiscal deficit is fresh currency injection into the 
non-government sectors of the economy, fuel for GDP growth (not a detraction via tax 
drain, so disproving the dead weight tax ideas).

This is not a proof of MMT.

ProfKeen had to assume MMT is the operational reality first. That is all in the code 
he writes. What ProfKeen's Minsky models equipped with a government sector are doing is 
showing _**if** what MMT describes is correct, **then** government deficits are fuel, not fire._

This is a conditional.

To use such models to "prove MMT" one has to then examine the data to see whether 
rising government deficits add to GDP, thus falsifying the Null Hypothesis of the New 
Keynesians and Neoclassicals that  welfare incurs a dead weight loss.

One cannot prove or disprove MMT without such empirical data.

### No Need for that Proof

I will repeat Warren Mosler's characterization of "MMT":

> MMT is the recognition that the currency is a public monopoly and the 
consequences thereof.

This is a legal definition. One *must* examine the legal statutes to, **(a)** find out 
what entity is a "public monopoly" and **(b)** what their "currency" amounts to, 
and then read up on the legally permitted monetary operations. You will find in every 
major nation of the globe that they all operate an MMT system --- provided the law is 
obeyed on average or in the majority of transactions. **_There really is no other proof 
of MMT_**. 

Of course, on a small island nation with no legal system to speak of on paper, this 
all could be a ladies and gentleman's agreement. Same thing though. Instead of reading 
legal statutes you'd ask these ladies and gentlemen how they operate their social 
obligation records.

This means the DougBot project proof is more like Steve Keen's: we pretend we do not 
comprehend the law, and dumbly see if a few assumptions turn out to match the reality of 
currency flows.


## Taking Away Our DougBot Food

One other conversation we had this week was over the correlation and lag from FICA tax 
acceleration to Employment and GDP rates of change (FICA would be payroll tax in NZ). 
If there is a strong correlation it would be proof that "tax drives the currency". 
There was indeed a strong eye-ball correlation. That is one of the consequences of 
MMT in the specific cases where the public monopoly issues their own fiat currency, 
and drives a significant demand for it by imposing payroll tax liabilities (rather 
than say promising gold or pizza delivery).

But then a key policy proposal of MMT is to get rid of FICA taxes, because **(a)** 
they are regressive, **(b)** they penalise what we want to actually incentivise (paid 
employment), and **(c)** there are far more progressive types of tax liability that 
could be imposed without risking tax evasions, or indeed incentivizing tax evasion, 
and **(d)** we want to eliminate the horrific waste of human life times spent on 
compliance costs for such backwards taxes. Give the accountants more holiday time.

It is far better to tax, by a simple fee or fine, egregious consumption (of owner 
unoccupied land or real estate, electricity, water,...) rather than taxing the work 
that produces the output we want.

Ah! But this would remove one data time series the DougBot would use to "prove MMT". 
So we are asking Mosler to shush his smart alec trap shut, for a while anyway.

## The Proof in the Eaten pudding

We have already had abundant evidence over the COVID supply shock crisis that, 

* government spending adds to GDP.
* Central bank bond rate hikes add to GDP.
* Government deficit acceleration comes *after* the inflation impulse, not before 
(is an effect, not a cause) --- to check this one must drag the CPI published inflation back in time to when the actual store prices would have risen.
* MMT also "predicts" (conditionally) that central bank rate hikes are directly 
inflationary --- but this was near to impossible to validate for most of the COVID-19 
era because all the initial inflationary impulse came from the effects of supply 
chain disruptions and mass lost output due to lockdowns, death, ongoing supply chain 
frictions, and then at the tail end egregious price gouging by OPEC+ and other 
monopolists (oil being the single biggest input to food production).

All consistent with MMT, and difficult to explain with any other mainstream school 
of thought.
