In casual talks with [Douglas MMT Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader) 
questions about what constitutes a "proof of MMT" or a disproof arose.


## Research Objectives

The DougBot project seeks to use MMT analytics (balance sheets and fiscal flow
essentially) together with neural network algorithms to predict forward prices on the 
more *macroeconomic sensitive* indices, like the SPX.

The motive does not ned to be to make money ahead of the average market returns, but 
(we think) more importantly to show the monetary system which underlies the financial sector, is an MMT system, even if the traders do not like it! so an educational 
project.


### Fooling the System without Fooling the System

You can have a system that runs by certain rules, but which when looked at purely 
empirically seems to not run by coherent rules.

Need an example? Consider Rugby: get all the equipment and trained teams et cetera, 
but then they all decide they "do not believe in Rugby" (too tankie-commie) and start 
playing football.
Interesting game, right. No tries get scored. Always a 0--0 draw. Even though plenty 
of "goals" are scored past the goalkeeper I suppose. (We are presuming the 
scorekeeper is only noting true Rugby scores. I guess the odd drop-kick might 
score 3 points.)

In a converse sort of example, imagine the rules are Newtonian gravity or general 
relativity, the system is our Solar System, but the rules you find are Ptolemaic 
epicycles. "Ha! We *made* the earth go around the Sun, suck on that Kepler!"

What about playing cricket with baseball equipment. It can be done. Pretty hard to
get clean bowled, so some odd scores again. You think you'll get 1 point for a "home 
run" but the cricket scorekeeper logs a 6. Babe Ruth: "What's going on here?" 
Don Bradman: "Lol!"

If you think a bunch of New Keynesians running the IMF and central banks is any 
different to these analogies,... maybe think again!

It can be a way to "understand" some of the craziness and chaos of financial markets.


## Push and Pulls


## Steve Keen's "Proof of MMT"

What ProfKeen does is code up a systme of ordinary differential equations using macroscpic identities (definitions) and balance sheet stock-flow relations (so accounting rules, obeyed by banking system software) and then he runs these models to "show" that a risign governemtn fiscal deficit is fresh currency injection into the non-governemtns sectors of the economy, fuel for GDP growth (not a detraction via tax drain, so disproving the dead weight tax ideas).

This is not a proof of MMT.

ProfKeen had to assume MMT is the operational reality first. That is all in the code 
we writes. What ProfKeen's Minsky models equippd with a governemtn sector are doing is showing _**if** what MMT describes is correct, **then** government deficits are fuel, not fire._
