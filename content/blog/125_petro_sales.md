There is no such thing as a "petrodollar."" There is no such thing as 
a "global reserve currency".

These are right-wing/neoliberal myth-makings, so do not fall for them, they 
skew discourse and limit people's imaginations about how the wokring class 
can gain real effective power.

## Aaron Good Bad Again

[Here Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELUv34f8qpI) 
is speaking with former spook, John Kiriakou. Mostly good stuff, I recommend 
listening.

But I reckon Aaron's thesis becomes even more hard hitting if he understood 
monetary systems properly. He takes a normative post-Keynesian--Marxist 
ideology, which might be fine for purposes of some political psychology 
analysis, but is horrifically 𖨚𖢧ꚶ𖡮𖥣𖦧𖥣 when it comes to monetary systems 
analysis.  (With me, in case you wanna know, it is always ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ ideas, 
not 🆂🅃𝑢𝓅ⓘ𝕕 people. People are not their ideas. We do however know 
people through their ideas, which is deceptive, and a cause of needless 
hatred.

Because modern society since  forever (way before capitalism) operates a 
monetary system (the social records of account) if you fail to analysis 
this system correctly it can skew your political analysis, which is the 
case here, since Aaron is missing a whole lot of important detail when he 
ascribes the break-down of Bretton-Woods as the foment of the rise of 
Neoliberalism --- this simplifies what he says, but it is basically what he 
is saying.

Neoliberalism is a long project, which began well before Nixon took the USA 
out of Bretton-Woods. I see neoliberalism as an academic-facing branch of 
the deeper state network, not overtly tied to the mobs and the criminal 
underworld and seedy aristocratic overworld. But that's a topic for 
another day.

## Records of Account Straightened

Today I only wan to make the necessary corrections, and leave it to you all 
to determine what this further implies for Aaron's thesis, which is 
essentially a correct thesis.

**Do not read this paragraph if you want an unbiased view:** <br>
My view is that while Capitalism (exploitation of labour by a privileged 
owner-class) is a source of so many of our ills, it is not by any means the 
sole source of most of our ills. "Capitalism" is in a sense and idealist myth, 
which I would say is set-up to be a convenient target for "the Left" to 
waste ammo at attacking. I do think for certain it is vital to have a class 
critique, and hence a critique of capitalism, but the problem is far worse 
than normal marxists will say or write abut. Aaron's thesis is the correct 
critique of capitalism, because it peels away the facade of power, and 
reveals the true rot.

**Also don't read this one:** <br>
I would not claim capitalist structures (bosses "own" the labour hours of 
the workers) are not truly horrific, and cause enormous suffering. Nor would 
I claim capitalism does not boost the criminal underwolrd and overworld of 
the deep state. But what i would say is that these more nefarious elements 
controlling political economy precede Capitalism qua Marx, by ancient orders 
of time magnitude. 

**Also, also, don't read this one:** <br>
The basic injustice is aristocracy. Capitalism is just a slicker modern form 
of a nest of flies of aristocrats. So it must be done away with. But 
Capitalism was not the cause of this nest of flies, it just allowed more 
of them the breed.  Socialists who hate me might say I am not being 
socialist or revolutionary enough. But I would say I am far more 
anti-capitalist than they are. I do not need to defend myself though, it is 
all plain to see if you open your eyes.


## The Betetr Critique of Capitalism

I think I jsut did this.

So let's move now to a little critique of Aaron and Kiriakou, which I 
beleive would better inform their critique of prevailing political economy 
and open up more avenues for interpreting recent political history. Stuff 
more in line with say Bill Mitchell.

🤑 [Fake economics here](https://youtu.be/ELUv34f8qpI?t=1492) from an 
otherwise terrific social scientist, so disappointing. 

USA was not converting to gold since 1930's. Bretton-Woods was a fixed 
exchange rate regime, not a gold standard. The "metal" is always a pretense, a form of needless austerity (which is to suppress demand, but in fact also kills people). The number of certificates for "gold" was so over-subscribed it was a farce, the currency was in fact always fiat with demand driven by coercive tax liabilities. (No one seriously desired the gold except rubes, until the French pressed the issue for purely political reasons (it was not the "get their gold". 

   The monopoly currency issuer does not sell bonds to get their own scorepoints. The bonds are interest rate maintenance (for no useful purpose once you are on a float). This serves no useful purpose except basic income but only for people who already have money and in proportion to how much money they already have.

The gold/oil “currency” pretense is exchange: only foreign governments and central banks could present dollars for gold; private convertibility was gone. All this gold/oil “money” was is simple trade, you get $ the other guys gets some commodity. It is a simple sales transaction. But like the drug and sex traffic trade, it can be used and exploited for sure for no damn good at all.

   A labour standard occurs when the State exchanges the tax credits for labour, and does not redeem for anything but tax liabilities. It is not so easy to exploit, since now you are asking real people to be the actual “units” being exchanged, their labour time. This is the proper “labour theory of value” —- the monopolist tells you the price. This creates the secondary labour market for those who cannot create the currency by keystrokes. It is in unfair market without State support for private sector labour (a job guarantee).

   There is also no such thing as a petrodollar nor a "global reserve currency". Those are myths fabricated by the power elites — I would argue sometimes not deliberately! But when deliberate and knowing they are control over the ignorant masses, entrenching policies on top of it all that impose austerity on the working class, and rents trickling up to the rich & powerful, underworld and overworld. The "tax payer" always funds the private sector, not the public sector. Government net spending funds the tax payer. 

   If you re-analyze Aaron's basic thesis from this point of view, it is even more sinister and I would claim so it is!


## Using Your Imagination

That's all I need to write I think. I already feel like I preach too 
much what is plain & obvious. If you take into consideration the above 
corrections, I think you can gain an even sharper understanding of the 
deep state a  and also a better understanding of how to extricate ourselves 
from it all.

The parliamentary representatives who claim they are too scared and fear for 
their lives if they speak what they know to be the truth are not worthy of 
political office. It is perhaps harsh to say this, safer in New Zealand of 
course, but in our day & age we need politicians who are prepared to lose 
their lives by speaking the truth. It is also somewhat self-centered to think 
you are the one great guy who will be the one assassinated. 

However, we cannot blame these weak & feckless politicians if they have no 
support from the mass of the people. What would _you_ do in their shoes? 

Wouldn't you realize it was a fruitless quixotic quest? So would you 
not _first_ build a massive well-educated (not by fake neoliberal schooling) 
working class base across the pomo cultural 
divides that forge only pointless hate and disunity?
