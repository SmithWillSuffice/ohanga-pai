If we are going to create chatMMT for fun, we are going to need a decent corpus 
of writing from Warren Mosler. You can't easily get the snappy one-liners otherwise.

A lot of the cool stuff from Mosler is in youtube interviews, so some audio-to-text 
transcribing efforts are needed? Unpaid internships anyone? (Excuse the crassness! 
Couldn't help myself.) At least Google tensorflow tools can do most of the work for 
us these days.

## Backstory

Warren knows me as this Kiwi bloke who supports MMT activists. But otherwise he does 
not know me from Adam (inside joke there). He's got a tonne of contacts, so it's no 
surprise he won't remember your name. However, he has somehow picked up on the fact 
I am a mathematical physicist (just a journeyman, but that puts me ahead of 99% 
of humanity).

To ruin the coolness of this story a little, I did email Warren about a Bretton-Woods 
question from a follower on tw33ter. But *otherwise* I get a call from Warren almost 
<font style="color: #1e90ff;">out-of-the-blue</font>!

To be fair, Warren did email me a cryptic one-liner:
> "We should chat about this!"

I replied I cannot talk before 9am NZT, due to sleeping beauties in the house.
Plus I was hung-over from a cold virus, and had been up all night writing, this was 
around 4am. So I thought I could get 4 hours sleep.

Bad mistake.

I dozed off and woke up at 9:30am. But thought, "Surely Warren would not call me 
(a nobody) before 9am?"
However, there was a bit of panic fumbling for the phone. Nothing. No alerts. 
Cool, got time to compose myself.

Check email then. Oh no!
> Warren: "I'll be on chat in a few minutes."

Me: "Wat \[sic.\] chat?" I do not have his phone number of course, and so I'm thinking 
Google Meet, since Warren is on gmail. But there's no Meet link. I'm a bit clueless 
about all the Apps. I work on the GNU+Lnixx commandline baby! But for tutoring and 
livestream I do use Meet.

But I check for a "Chat" app, and so I find it. Hmmmm... maybe....?

Doh!

Guess what?

Four missed calls to me from Warren Mosler. He started calling at 8:30am NZT. 
Da<font style="color: #3cb371;">mm</font>i<font style="color: #3cb371;">t</font> Warren!

So without breaking a sweat, I hurriedly reply and apologise. 

5 minutes later, the Chat buzzes, and Warren's on the line saying, 
"Hi! How's it going? What's up?"

As if I hadn't just (potentially unprofessionally) ignored four of his calls.

So that's where the rest of this blog post picks up...
