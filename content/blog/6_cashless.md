Over at [Real Progressives](https://realprogressives.org/podcast_episode/episode-181-cloudmoney-with-brett-scott) (an awesome educational and activist group) they have a 
library of podcasts on macroeconomics and social issues relevant to our times, loads 
of politics and brilliant thinkers. One of them is Brett Scott (a South African, 
probably a Bok supporter, but we won't hold that against him aye All Blacks fans). 
His wheelhouse is fintec (the horrors of it) and payments systems, particularly cash, 
and the 
[War on Cash (for readers)](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/war-on-cash/) 
or if you prefer watching talks, [try here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE1IiiIV0A)


## Control and Domination

If you control the payments system you are a little bit like a god. 
That's not healthy. Better that no one person does that, and rather a democracy 
has the control.

For a more scholarly argument you need to read or listen to Brett. The gist of the 
war on cash is fourfold, which I've modulated from Brett's framing by inserting 
vital MMT knowledge:

1. We ought not let private companies gain fees off running the public currency 
system, or even small aspects of it.
2. Scott does not claim cash should be king and total, but he argues it limits social 
inclusion and some privacy if people cannot use cash.
3. The war involves banks shutting down ATM and bank branches, making it impossible 
for people to even get or move cash through the banking layer. The War involves many 
other methods, most people are not even aware, it is a silent war. VISA run active 
propaganda for their war on cash, co-opting your favourite celebrities --- it is to raise their profits. Where do you think those profits come from? 
4. Digital currency forms permit egregious surveillance if there are no regulatory 
protections (the software banks use is proprietary and closed source).

About the War on Cash: it is insidious, and I do buy Brett Scott's argument and 
evidence. There is in fact no need at all to have any profit motive in the banking 
or payments system. Banking should be boring. Credit risk assessment, payments 
clearing, that is it. The government is the monopoly currency issuer, and should 
regulate their currency to make people know it is still the currency monopolist (yes, 
they still are, you cannot hack the law books so easy my dudes.)

A few sockcuckers will probably rant that the profit motive is needed to keep the 
bankers in line with customers. But this is an old hag-toothed saw of a myth. If you 
go back a sec and read what I said narrow banking should be, there is nothing to 
compete on: wear a bigger smile? The bank that assesses credit risk more diligently 
should never get a profit for it, since that will skew their computations. The worse 
credit assessor can make the bigger mortgage loans.

Customers cannot discipline banks either, since 99% of customers have no clue whether 
their bank is close to insolvency or is a deposit risk. Governments can just 100% 
insure all deposits in their currency unit. The proper discipline on banking 
is rather on the assets side, not the liabilities. (I stole that from Warren Mosler, 
so it's got 12 cylinder overhead valve chrome plated grease nipple cred, my dudes.) 
So the credit assessments need to be disciplined by logic and mathematics, not profit 
motive. Luckily plenty of humans are pretty good at actuarial mathematics, at least 
good enough, and some are even mad keen about it they'll work for peanuts to balance 
a ledger. (Those types tend to have other issues, like ax murdering in their spare 
time, but bank discipline is not going to suppress any of that, we have other systems 
to keep psychopaths in check outside work hours. Such as making commutes to work 
unnecessary.)

((Maybe "we the bankers" need fully digitised law books too, then we *can* hack 
them, then eliminate government from the money system? Justathought.))

(((Bankers enjoy so much solidarity it makes any old school lefty puke.)))


## Function, not Form, is the critical issue

What I think Brett overlooks is that cash serves a function; it can protect 
anonymity, it (used to be) acceptable anywhere; it is comforting to some people; 
it is ready-to-use; it can avoid embarrassment; and so on and so forth, and last 
but not least it can extinguish a tax liability for damn sure, no questions asked.

My point is an alternative payments system can serve the *same functions* and do a 
better job of it, and that should become the *new cash*. We aught to just create 
such a system, and then call it cash, because functionally that is what it *is*, not 
in form, but in abstract essence.

I would like to hear from anyone who thinks this is not the case and that something 
unique and essential about physical cash (notes and coins, or even cheques) is missing 
in something like an open source protected central bank digital currency. 
I will concede the *comfort* of physical cash might have to go, but you can put fluffy 
ears on your digital wallet plastic thingy. (This is not a credit card, but would look 
similar I guess. It is a tax credit card, the opposite of a credit card.)

((By the way, please do not use the term "tax credit card" in polite company. 
Although *we* know it is accurate, other people will completely misconstrue the 
meaning.))

The cheap-as-peanuts chip in the floppy cash card should *not* have any proprietary 
firmware in it of course, and should be free-libre software. The banking system only 
needs a ledger as a second security, in case this chip get zapped by a strong 
magnetic or cosmic ray. Otherwise, it is like physical cash, it knows it's own 
present value, and is not coupled to the Internet. When using it to pay you should be 
able to visibly see the number marked-down,and likewise if you sell something the 
number is marked up, or with tactile response for the blind.

You have to disabuse yourself of the notion in the USA the FED is a private bank, or 
if you still think it is, then we will say Congress scraps the FED (they did create 
it) and creates a proper central bank, a branch of government, protected by whatever 
democracy you can muster. Maybe even the board of the Central Bank branches are 
locally elected. They do not even need to be bankers, the permanent staff will have 
the expertise to run the payments system. They will not be into selling Treasury 
bonds. They will not be permitted to bail out fraudulent private institutions.


### Avoiding trivilization of the comfort

I did trivialize too much. The thing is, I believe there is a residual important 
comfort factor for physical cash (notes and coins). But I do not buy Brett Scott's 
rhetoric that saving cash is the way to go to maintain an inclusive society free from 
predatory banks.

This is similar to the one-tweet beef I had with Rohan Grey ([see below](#caveats)). 
Grey wants to protect certain workers by allowing sellers to be anonymous. Whereas I 
do not think that is healthy for a civilized society. We ought to protect precarious 
and vulnerable workers in other more substantial ways than by anonymising the 
payments layer. Firstly by eliminating precarious and vulnerable work. Why should a 
sex worker have to commodify their body? It makes total inhuman sense to me. Why 
should an abortion clinic fear the bombers? A payments anonymity is not going to 
prevent them from being discovered. 

Likewise with Brett Scott's fears for the vulnerable and those whom the banks prey 
upon. Why the hell do we need the payments system to protect them? That, to me, is 
ceding power to capitalism. We can do much better. Such as making banking boring 
(the 
[Mosler Proposals](http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Proposals-for-the-Treasury.pdf). 
They afford a huge amount of consumer protections very elegantly and parsimoniously.)

I mean who is really being na√Øve here? Myself, who says we can have far better and 
stronger protections for workers, or Brett and Rohan who want to use a system that is 
not designed to protect workers to protect workers? I appreciate it can be useful to 
design the payments layer to better protect workers, but I think it is insufficient 
protection, and if you cannot see that then I am awfully sorry for your poor 
intellect. There is a dirtbag leftie argument though: you gotta do what you can. So 
in the USA, and maybe the UK, remaking the payments layer to fully include cash, 
might be one way of temporarily protecting some workers, and that might be useful if 
that is the only reform you can get. From this perspective I come across like an 
idealistic fool, which is fair criticism if you have this perspective. I do not. I 
think current societies can do better, all is not hopelessly capitalist realism.

If you do want a form of payments that is functionally the same as cash, and still 
physically comfortingly close to cash, then make the plastic the tax credit cards are 
made from floppy and show the amount of credit on them, visibly, like a note. 
You might call them "smart notes" and then go all Luddite on me because they have 
embedded firmware. The solution to that is offer consumers free-libre software 
floppy cash cards.

This is the physics ontology fallacy. Notes and coins are made of the same stuff as 
plastic card, electrons and quarks. Paper cash can be hacked perhaps even more easily 
than digital wallets, since a digital wallet can be password protected, but a 
pick-pocket can hack your notes and coins in the blink of an eye.  That's called 
hacking in The Matrix, since if we were in a Matrix that pickpocketing would be all 
digital functions and algorithms. Point is, we *do* live in a Matrix. Of a social 
type, for sure, quantum physics and Einstein spacetime and all that, but it is still 
a rule-driven system that permits hacks.

Socially protected cash cards, or floppy comfy cash, is one thing which can be done 
in a society --- so I guess the Thatcherites believe it cannot be done. In a society 
other people who can comprehend the software will check it for bugs and back-doors, 
*you* do not have to be individually responsible for securing your cash, the whole of 
society can.

What I like about all this is that you can see I am almost merging with Brett Scott, 
because once I abstract the necessary functions of cash into some other more secure 
system, there is really no difference in my position and Brett's. We just have to 
abstract Brett Scott.

We might see different ways to save cash, but functionally they'll be near enough to 
the same in every important way. The psychological attachment to cash in notes and 
coins can easily be overcome, without losing any of the other important functions. 
That is because humans are incredibly adaptive beings. Few people cherish their old 
Tamagotchi or PlayStation2 or worry that a vinyl record cannot ever be produced again 
if one wants one (they are still produced these days, you just have to want one).

Now a few comments on the above points.


### Point 1 --- private money is private control

Although anyone can make money, the problem is getting others to accept it. Well you 
cannot do the latter unless by some force, either psychological persuasion (a parent 
issues their kids an IOU; or for a very short period a cryptotoken or baseball card 
fools allure) or directly (a hut tax, or fines and fees).

If governments permit private institutions to emit the public currency units, this is 
not good, they are giving a public power over to private interests.

However, the public currency can be facilitated by private institutions who are 
licenced and regulated by the state. The state's burden might be then less, since 
fewer regulators are employed to regulate than public servants might be to run the 
bank. Whether that's a net win for us is a pragmatic calculation. And easy enough to 
compute if it's veering too much one way or the other. 

In the USA today far too much private credit creation power exists and there are far 
too few regulators protecting the public interest, so that has gone too far away from 
a cash system.

The point Brett Scott makes, and this is very important, is that when banks shut down 
ATM and teller branches, they are forcing people to use their bank cards. But the 
currency unit is still the state currency, so what is the problem?

The problem is that using the bank **_instruments_** (credit cards, EFT-POS, 
mortgages, hire-purchase) allows the banks to charge you transaction fees. The fees 
are so small most people do not care, but that is a fallacy of composition. Like 
voting in elections, the cumulative effect is a massive distortion. In voting it 
gives you democracy, but in banking is delivers power and control to single private 
institutions, the banks. It is far more egalitarian if the government's bank, the 
central bank, gives you payments access without fees, and without making your 
personal information the proprietary right of the banks to store.

Governments do not need to charge fees, since they are the currency issuers. Unless 
they need to drive more demand for their currency, they can run payments for free, as 
a public utility, the cost of this is moving people who run the system out of the 
private sector into the public sector, that is the "pay for."  Some folks are 
religiously opposed to that, but they cannot fairly oppose a system that has both 
options, private fee-charging banks *and* public fee-less banks.

People say they would not trust governments either, and they're not wrong, but that's 
a failure of democracy, not a success for democracy, so what you want is a public 
currency system that is open and transparent and more democratic, not less.
By all means though, if you trust a private banker more, then you can have the option 
to have them store your data instead. My point (same as Brett) is that people should 
have the option.


### Point 2 --- cash remains

I think it would take extreme draconian measures now to protect physical cash. 
For one thing, most vendors would need to be forced to accept cash as legal tender. 
But it is possible. I doubt Brett Scott can raise that army though.

Also, and this is more important, I did not find anything in Brett's presentations 
that is a unique function of cash and cash alone (as I said, you can put 
fluffy ears on your tax credit card, the amount of bling is limited by your 
creativity). The fact it is difficult to forge paper or 
coin is not an essential function that provides any of the protections Brett wants 
for people. it is the other functions that do: anonymity, no transactions fees, 
less power to bankers and fintec, and so forth. But none of these are unique 
properties of cash notes and coins.

So abstracting away the essential protections, the word **_cash_** can be used to 
describe other types of payments system that there is no war upon. Or we can design 
one that escapes the war.

The [Modern Money Network](https://rohangrey.net/writing/#digital) central bank 
digital wallet is one such system. With a few caveats, that are not hard to satisfy.


### Point 3 --- the war on cash

If we take note of point-2, then it becomes easy to see how to avoid a war on cash. Make cash some form protected easily by our democracy. This is not hard.


### Point 4 --- surveillance state as bad as oligarchy bankers

The way to secure digital cash is with open source software, but I would agitate vociferously for free-libre software for this putative future public payments system. People have to not only collectively own it, they need to feel they own it.

This means to the point of allowing anyone to submit software patches. (Submitting a patch does not mean it gets accepted.)


## Caveats

I know what you are going to say, if you live in the UK or USA, which is that (a) you cannot trust your government, and (b) the Congress is too moribund to clear out the cockroaches at the FED and open the US central bank system up to democratic control.

Well,... (a$^\prime$) how about trusting the private firms more? And (b$^\prime$) I think Brett Scott is never going to get his army to win the war on cash, so you'd better force your government to protect some payments system that has the same function as cash.
Because you are going to lose paper and coin currency anyway (except for collector 
catalogues and historian's museums). If you do not see a CBDW as functionally as good 
as cash, you'd better look-up 
[Rohan Grey](https://rohangrey.net/writing/#digital) 
and the [MMN people](https://www.modernmoneynetwork.org/) to figure out the functional equivalent.

As a mathematics nerd, I can tell you that is an easy thing to do. 

I got into a one-tweet "feud" (the only one that has ever existed) with Rohan about 
GNU Taler, which provides anonymity for buyers, but not sellers (by design) and is 
purely a payments method, not itself a currency (it is just software for frictionless 
payments with encryption security, and is open source free licenced, so is better 
than PayPal). Rohan blasted me because some categories of workers who sell stuff a 
few lunatics do not want them too, need protection, so should also have anonymity 
protected.

((I do not think the payments system is the right place to protect workers, but it 
might be a necessary last ditch protection in some backwards countries, like the 
USA.))
 
This ignores the fact GNU Taler can always protect certain categories of sellers too. 
You just design it so. It is just software. It is an existing proof of concept for a 
central bank digital wallet.  The point is, the technology already 
exists for serving most of the functions of cash. My only other point was that GNU 
Taler is free-libre software, so any central bank can use it, modify it to suit 
public use to protect anyone Rohan Grey wants to protect, and it remains free-libre 
(by the GNU copyleft licence).

I hope I do not come across as a nasty old grouchy nemesis of Brett Scott's. I do 
think the war on cash is real. There are smart ways to win it for the 
common people --- which I think is to abstract cash and make it bullet proof 
by function.

Whenever something exists identifiable as a war, it is usually not good for someone in 
society, and usually tremendously so-much-winning for some giant fat asshole in a 
suit. In any case, if Brett does rouse up an army for this war, I'll be giving them my 
intellectual guns.

### Your Challenge

Force me to re-write or delete this post by coming up with an unassailable objection to either (i) retiaign cash, but also(ii) making cahs better, using secured digital wallets, free from the banking system, but accepted as "tax credit" anywhere. The same function as existing cash.
