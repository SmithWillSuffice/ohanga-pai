This is a tale of the North Going Xat and the South Going Xat.

## Other Sides of Ledgers

Me and my friends might agree with all you liberal bourgeois 
well-credentialled elites 90% of the time, it's that 10% of the time when 
_we_ are on the right side of justice when _you_ should listen to us and 
yet you won't.

Yanis Varoufakis is one of these elites, with an inflated ego, who thinks 
he is right and the dirtbag MMT likes of us are --- not even wrong --- we're 
just never listened to, that completely ignored class. More untouchable 
than the untouchables.,Dalit without Dalit.

Guys. Bluesky gals, Mastodon guys. Yanis is no saviour. 

He is most especially wrong when he says, "There's a little fascist in 
all of us."

Who the hell is he to speak for us?

Mind your own mental qualia I would say.

Superhero comic fandom is the flip side of fearing the Big Daddy.

When I was twelve years old I knew Superman was a fascist. But I liked 
it. Kids are conditioned to like the Ayn Rand fash, after all, when you are 
a child you are puny and helpless and need s big strong Daddy. 

But you are capable of spiritual growth and so can grow the heck out of 
that phase.

One reason why The Batman is so revered is because he is more honest. 
Superman is the fascist who is respectable enough to take home with 
you to meet your parents. Batman is the honest one whom you want to 
stay the hell away from as he saves your ꗇꕷꕷ from the fictional 
Inflaton Boogeyman.

Batman is the more respectable in the end then. But that's the wrong word. 
What is the appropriate word? Comprehensible. It is comprehensible why so 
many people worship The Batman, all good people have an innate appreciation 
and reverence for honesty.
This does not excuse their fascism.
You can see this in today's Clown King phenome, DJT.

To turn it all around we need to wake people up to their inner and 
collective Batman. We are all defenders of justice when we act together, 
not as vigilantes.

But Great Men is the wrong metaphor. People are great. Men are idiots. 

Even some arrogant 𝕒𝕗 individuals have acknowledged this, my favourite of whom was Isaac Newton: "If I have further than others it is only because I stand on the shoulders of giants."

Even that was a bit off-colour, since by the implied logic there never 
were individual giants in the history of science. By like Einstein (minus 
the misogyny). Being a Giant without Being a Giant.

Have a think too.

No, I mean have a _proper_ think.

Do you honestly regard Andrew Yang, Peter Theil and Guy Standing as better 
macroeconomic justice thinkers than yours truly the Dirtbag MMT'er? 
(No, I mean _apart_ from the fact that I just parrot Mosler like an MMT LLM.)

Right? So maybe take heed of what I write, not what they spew.

I might be wrong on occasion about quantum gravity, but I am not wrong 
about justice for the working class. Do not take your "eye off the prize" 
either. The prize is to eliminate economic class and inequality. Not to 
alleviate material poverty. The former guarantees the latter, not the other 
way around.

All attempts at state welfare have always failed. But do you 
ubi sᵢmᵖlₑtᵒn iⁿnₒcᵉnₜ 𝖈𝖚𝖓𝖙𝖘 understand why?

Liberal state welfare is what we do not want. What we want is social welfare. 
What does that mean? It means we want control over our own lives so that we 
never need to appeal to state welfare. The only welfare worth having comes 
from our own community.  The legitimate State apparatus should exist (in modern 
times, I acknowledge all the past history is sewage under the bridge) in order 
to facilitate community welfare. That means basic stuff, like helping and 
serving each other. This is anti-servitude. 

If you just have no idea what I am talking about, and are suffering a brain 
hemorrhage from cognitive dissonance, then I do apologize, but no one ever 
said learning was easy.

People who think "the other way around" _j'accuse_ as guilty of money 
fetish. It is never about "the money". That's the whole point of MMT 
education and awareness --- to completely take "the money" off the table.
We mean, of course, take all _concern_ about "the money" and the insatiable 
desire for "savings" off your minds. The 
focus is on meaningful lives and work. To eliminate 🅱𝘂𝓵🅛🅂𝖍𝗶🅃 work, and to 
enhance public services. A UBI accomplishes _none_ of this, and actively
works against the goodness, it focuses your attention on the money, exactly 
the opposite of what we want to achieve (here on the dirtbag left).

We are always _today_ living in material poverty. No one ever has as much 
as they desire. To move to a better tomorrow all you need to do is reduce your 
material desires and what _we all_ need to do is fight for government policy 
that eliminates extreme inequality --- the good Bell Curve (anti-Pareto 
distributions). This does not mean living in starvation nor like a monk, 
nor in want of basic Maslow needs and all that. It means also first (or 
eventually, last, whatever order you can manage I guess) becoming 
spiritually rich. Knowing the difference between silly desires and basic 
needs --- like some ’puter power to research quantum gravity.🤣

If you think I am contradicting myself in some way, I politely suggest you 
are missing something. But I literally (not just literally, but _literally_) 
have no time and energy to write a book on all this trying to mansplain myself 
any better. I'd like to be able to write in mild-mannered sweet words and 
powerful righteous principles and lofty language, but my time is too short. 
Besides, others have already done so, in with far higher spiritual authority 
than I will ever muster, but modesty (or something ... it's more like proper 
pedagogy I believe) forbids me from naming those sources. It's better you 
discover for yourself, since the Name is really unimportant. I'll just say 
if you sincerely ask, then I'd be ok with sharing my views. Some things are 
just too important to reduce to propaganda and proselytizing.

It's incumbent on you to figure some things out for yourself, I 
can only point you in a decent direction, towards justice, and away from 
greed and selfishness and false "freedoms."

Can I just suggest (maybe unhelpfully for you!?), if you are working in a 
job you hate, then quit, or 
organize your comrades to make the workplace a nicer place to work. Why the 
ꖾꗍꝆꝆ are you giving _that_ boss${}^\dagger$ your labour time? Or are you that ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ 
that _you_ think you the mighty Han Solo or Ayn Randdotcom can make a 
difference to the world only when you've got a handsome income and acquire 
sufficient savings of government scorepoints?  Welcome to the Mind of Gates, 
Welcome to the Machine.

Sorry. Did I get too dirtbag for you?

${}^\dagger$I mean _aside_ from the fact you need the government's 
scorepoints.


## 'Legislation' is not a Dirty Word

All this of course is preparatory ground-work for when a Job Guarantee bill 
is offered before Parliaments. You better damn well be on the side 
pressuring government to pass the bill. 

If not then I will hunt you down and metaphorically wedgie you to death 
until your underpants appear on the other side of your cranium effecting 
a surgical severing of your corpus callosum.  At least then 
only half your brain might be a total ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗.
