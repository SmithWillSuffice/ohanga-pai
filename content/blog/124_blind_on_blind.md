## The Blind

You do not have to see someone's face in order to trust them.

## The Other Blind

As with recent posts, reading Aaron Good's thesis in 
_[American Exception](https://americanexception.com/author/aaron_good/)_ 
is critical, otherwise much of this below will just sound like loony bin 
conspiracy theory. Although knowing of Aaron since the old Michael J Brookes
days, it is only relatively recently since reading more works like 
Whitney Webb's One Nation Under Blackmail)_ that I really appreciated 
the critical importance of Good's main thesis. 

That is because in the past I would have naïvely believed the nominal 
"democratic" state does have the power to overcome the overworld and 
underworld deep state, just by virtue of sheer numbers in Parliaments, and 
popular working class support.

If a politicians is good, then they will not need organized labour. 
Organized labour is essential because politicians are generally not very 
good (which can mean maybe they have kind hearts, but are clueless what can 
be done with a kind heart --- the answer is to not ever worry about getting 
re-elected, instead just do the right thing.) In fact, when campaigning, 
you do not even want to worry about not getting elected, you want to be 
worrying about the ꕷꖾꕯꖡ you'll have to face if you _are_ elected.  Better 
to not get elected. That's an individualist veiw of course, not collectivist. 
We would rather they do get elected, the kind-hearted candidates that is.
 
I realize USA Congress is not quite there yet. But I do extend AE to all 
western nations, even non-western nations, since the bribery and blackmail 
is, or so I believe, fairly universal. But enough good people work in 
enough governments in the "Madisonian" institutions to thwart the deep sate. 

The worry I have in more recent times is that the USA deep state infects 
more than just the USA, and the UK is congenitally joined to the USA, and 
New Zealand umbilically still attached in many minds to the UK, if not by 
import/export co-dependence anymore.

I would just guess that New Zealand is already controlled by neoliberalism, 
so is not in "need" of gangsters. These days though, you have to give 
that a second thought.  Why was Adern's cabinet unable to pass a 
Job Guarantee for example, to eliminate child poverty? That was her basic 
platform and reason for being PM.

## Tinder Fire?

Where is the fire?

One other reason Aaron's work has "excited" me recently, is because 
of the near deafening silence on the recognition of the core problems 
of our governmental systems.

People seem to be blaming the bad apples. But it is a systemic failure, 
requiring radical overhaul, and courageous politicians and public servants 
are needed, and we there to support them fully and I'd say almost 
unconditionally support them.

There is a good to government, what political scientists in Aaron's vein 
refer to as the _Madisonites_. The security state are the _Trumanites_, 
and the deep-state mafiosi (overworld + underworld) are the third part 
of tripartite government.

Only two fo  these are illegitimate aspects of government.

All three exist I believe to some extent in all nations, except maybe 
small island nations.

The one legitimate form of government is what people tend to blame and 
criticize, but this is horrifically misdirected anger. It is blaming the 
vicom almost. Blaming the powerless.

The reason why people forming the nominal democratic state are so 
pathetic (for the most part) is because there is a self-selection 
process in play, the more careerist insipid and feckless "big speakers" 
"little thinkers" are the ones offered up to you to vote for. There is 
also self-sortition once they get into Parliament. The "team players" get 
the juicy portfolios, the more neoliberal you are the closer to the 
Finance Minster.  A totally rotting system, but mainly because of the 
workings of the other two aspects of tripartite government, security 
state and deep sate. So it is wasting your breathe, largely, to point 
fingers at and curse those who happen to rise to the seats in the 
democratic face of government.

If you think, "we have no hope" that is because deep down you know these 
democratic actors are largely just that, mere actors. It is not really 
their fault. They're often just as much victim as you and me. Hey... not 
that I am making excuses for them, that's not what i am doing. I am saying 
activist effort has to get smarter, and divulge the root causes of 
corruption of _our_ government.

We would be half all-right if there only was this one legitimate form 
of government. It is a whole ideology and paradigm that brings the overworld 
and underworld aspects of government into power and all but completely 
dominating the one legitimate form of government, which is the nominal 
democratic state. The nominal democratic states need to be made the real, 
not just the nominal. This can only happen if the tow other blocs of 
government are completely abolished. 

How? Well, that's not for today, but I can tease more writing on this in 
the weeks ahead, which I am sure no one of any significant influence is 
reading, but it's "out there" anyway as evidence that am I still not 
requiring pharmaceutical anti-depressants. But although you may feel of 
no significant influence, you certainly are not when united with other 
workers.

Thus a wieser leftist activism is needed, and towards this end many 
elements of conservative thought are not altogetrh our enemies, provided 
only they are pro-worekr and anti-oligarch. The cultural wars thus have to 
be placed squarely in the background. Why, after all, do women in several 
USA states now not have a legal right of choice? It is not because 
of "conservatism".


##  Oil is No Longer the Target?

When a predatory state can control information then who pumps oil up out of 
the ground and sells it is almost irrelevant, provided they can be controlled. 

However, countering this, we have empires always collapse," hubris, clown 
fascism, and all the rest --- which speaks to maybe the information 
tyrants --- the tech oligarchy --- could be undermined by the more physical 
overworld of the deep state. 

In the end, oil and _energy_ in general, is the target. Which means deep 
state mafia-state actors need to be watched out for in solar, geothermal, 
wind and other "green" energy sources. The new Oil is whatever we get energy 
from.  There is of course an horrendous nexus here in the uranium mining 
and processing sector, for obvious reasons. Uranium is, in this abstract 
generalization, merely very densified Oil!

Even if the trade in nuclear weapon tech is kept in the underworlds and 
overworlds, it is still a form of Drug Trade. These dark markets are not all 
dark, they appear on the stock exchanges in open sight, so are indeed both 
underworld and overworld, and the point is not to create a nuclear war to 
overthrow the pinkos and commies (where are they exactly?) but to perpetuate 
the criminal enterprise of the oligarchic world order. It is almost blasphemous 
to call it "Capitalism", since that construct "Capitalism" is a total 
ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ cartoon idea which K. Marx and others had completely absurd 
idealistic idea  about, cloaked in the false fabric of Materialism. 

There is no such thing.

Private ownership of the means of production is ancient, preceding the 
Enclosures, And in modern form the political economy barely has anything 
resembling the popular understanding known as "Capitalism" --- private 
ownership of the workers, profit motive, government stays out of markets (yet 
creates the markets)!

In a sense --- and this is where I would extend Aaron Good's thesis --- 
Capitalism is largely a distraction and a giant Limited Hangout itself. 
Because "capitalists" have never been the problem.

To prove the point, just imagine ownership of the means of production was 
all in worker cooperatives. Well, they'd be capitalists.

So it has never been a crisis of capitalism. It's always been the 
aristocracy, the oligarchy and the plutocracy, melded at the weird Siamese 
hip with the underworld of organized crime. governments and capitalistic 
firms are just highly superficial outward facing manifestations of this 
much broader Deep State, which has never been exclusive to the USA. To think 
the Deep State is a mainly USA imperialist problem is laughable. It's not 
even traced back to British imperialism. It goes back much further. How do 
you think the Pharoahs commanded the working class? By magical thought 
control? No. It's always been a mafia underworld doing the dirty work, 
since time immemorial.

Today, we the workers, just have to stand up and say "No more." We are done. 
Murder us, cripple us, but we make the milk and bread, so you are not going 
to survive without us, but we are not going to let you pretend anymore that 
our plight of poverty is something we deserved by not saving up enough 
government scorepoints.
We know your underbelly, and it is not just privilege and influence thanks 
to the hoarded government scorepoints, it is your usage of a vast criminal 
underworld too.


BTW, that's the most contradictory thing about capitalism: the idea the 
government creates markets (government is the currency monopolist) and yet is 
told to stay out of markets. As my earlier essay this year remarked, there is 
never a contradiction. There is only something you are missing. In this case 
it is that the governments are by-in-large controlled by deep state overworld 
and underworld criminal enterprises, the former colloquially known as the 
oligarchy or plutocracy, fthe latter known as the mafia (thought that is 
generalized, not restricted to Italian mobs of course, it's world-wide 
multicultural organized crime).

What sustains oligarchy, plutocracy, aristocracy and despotism is both 
material and idealistic. The material side os of course the obvious lust 
for riches and control over things to do with food, drugs, sex, and other 
base psychological drivers. But the idealist side is equally important, the 
lust over having lots of government scorepoints, the influence that entails, 
the psychology of needing to have more Mercedes and whathaveyou than the 
neighbour, and control over sexualized/objectivized celebrity culture, and 
all the rest.

When I say "all the rest" I leave that up to your imagination, since 
whatever you imagine is likely something I'd agree with, it's just too 
long a list to state explicitly and I am lazy, and do not like the literary 
style of making lists and citing "documentation". That's for lawyers. 


## Reality TV Show?

Speaking of lawyers, there is a good use for them in my view. I'd like to 
pitch to any film producers right here a concept for a "actually good" 
Netflix/HBO show. (Whichever production company is not funded and propped up 
by the deep state!) 

We stage TV court trials of all the war criminals in history, and all the 
SCAD (State crimes against democracy). There's an endless source, but bulk 
stuff could short the Season-021. The entire Bush-II administration for 
example.  The cliff hanger questions being whether naïve boy scuts like 
Col. Larry Wilkerson escape conviction of war crimes, and only his boss 
gets the Reality TV jail time.

season 1 would be the lower ranks of the deep state, the mostly unrecognizable 
names in the popular consciousness, like James Angleton, Meyer Lansky and 
that crowd. Season-2 would be riskier and would but say LBJ and Cheney 
on trial (among many others). And Season-3 even spicier putting living 
persons like Clinton, Blair, Obama "and all the rest" on trial.

I'd want creative control of course! 🤣

The insistence would just be to keep it at an historical documentary level, 
not to descend into sensationalist Reality TV. It'd by hyper-reality TV. 
A fitting end curtain I should say to the postmodern era (defined as the 
political economy of the ends times of "Capitalism" --- though as remarked 
above, it is nothing like "Capitalism" and never has been.)

Just say "thank you" and send me the royalties when you can, ok?


But you know, I'd produce the show deadly seriously, without actors. Except 
for the dead guys and Thatchers/Adelsons/Clintons. 


I will be pitching this to film studios and writer--producers, but if 
someone steals the idea and gets there ahead of me, well great. Saves me the 
effort.  I don't want the royalties really. But if any of you do grab this 
idea, just for heavens sake don;'t slop-it-up like a clown Relaity show. 
The whole idea worth "patenting" is dto do the whole thing as a damn serious 
court trial, like of The Hague proportions --- Season-4 is placing the 
institution of the Hague on trial for gross incompetence and intelligences, 
and bring the case The Hague has itself been nazified or at least mafiarized, 
and in some ways is the pinnacle of Limited Hangout.

Season-5 is the United Nations.

That's getting very hyper-real.But there is a case to be made. The UN is 
the correct institution for international peace & harmony, but it is 
thoroughly corrupted, so while the UN needs to be put on trial, the concept 
is like the 2008 GFC crisis response: you fire the management, but do not 
need to close down the bank (which serves no public purpose). (Banks are not 
the problem. Failure to regulates banks wisely is the problem. Payments 
clearing is a boring uncorruptible operation, and so banks shoudl be 
thoroughly boring public institutions. Hence all banking corruption is 
some else, something other than payments clearing operations.)

I guess maybe Season-5 should be the banking/monetary system on trial, since 
this is the crucial MMT prosecution case. Then Season-6 would be the 
United Nations.

Anyway, just in case there are some royalties down the road, this essay is 
a public document I am submitting as proof the concept was my idea, and I am 
informally copylefting or patenting it... or whatever!!  The point being not 
to flash this around in a Torts Court to get my royalties, but just that if 
I can use this to get the royalties then it would only be to make sure I do 
not die of starvation and everything on top of coffee, sandwiches and rents, 
goes to a pool of funds for worker organization at the grass roots.

Apologies of course to anyone who has already slide-deck prepared and 
pitched this Reality TV concept to studios. I'm to trying to crowd-in.

My plea here is for exquisite artistry. I hate Reality TV. I hate "TV". But 
there is a beautiful irony of "exploiting" Reality TV if done really well, 
professionally, and really just "stick some cameras" in a fake courtroom, and 
get real lawyers to litigate all these crimes against humanity. It is only 
necessary because our real world institutions are not doing the job. So in 
postmodernist times we practically only have the artificial reality format 
to to it ourselves. 

While theatre, I think the concept should be firmly in the production crew 
mind that we are putting people and institutions on trial in a worldwide 
court of public opinion, and the farce that it will be a "Netflix" show is 
the obvious whole point! The working class today have very few other 
actionable options for tearing down the ancient tens of thousands year long 
aristocracy that began with the concept of village chiefs, social bullies, 
and medicine men, Mandarins, the elites who "know better," so you and I have 
to just "shut up or take a hike!"

I want the entire production crew, right down to the dame marketing 
department, to be fully on-board.  If some of them a deep-staters then I'd 
want them to just be gutsy enough to say so, we could use their insights 
on the show! But no script-writers. The players in the show will be 
professional lawyers and researchers, like Aaron, prepared to put in 
the time to make the whole production a realistic court drama. In other 
words, at times, boring 𝕒𝕗 . Since we'll want to the resources available 
film the back-stories too, how the lawyers would prepare for such aa case 
in real-life. So a parallel documentary of the "Making of the Cae 
against the Deep State."

Getting near the end of my pitch now.

The next thing to make clear is the purpose. It is not to make profit off 
just another Reality TV concept. No. It is not just entertainment and 
distraction (pomo CIA plant etc). No. The purpose, explicitly, overtly and in 
every other way, is **public education**. There is _no other purpose_ to this 
film/TV concept proposal.

If such a Reality Show appears that is pure entertainment, fictionalized, 
with actors and scripts, then that is not my idea, and I'd' want no royalties 
therefrom, even if someone forced them to appear in my bank account.

Why? Because in my view once the purpose weighted to more than about 20% 
entertainment or profit motivated, then it is corrupted. (NB: Education should 
be about 10% to 20% entertainment, all the good teachers have an inner 
stand-up comedian or Shakespeare in them.)

The idea is that it will be "entertaining" (in the dark sort of way) 
automatically simply because of the whole concept.

Just keep in mind, if such an entertainment show is done crassly for 
entertainment, like a typical USA style Reality TV show, that is not mine, 
I do not want royalties form that ꕷꖾꔇꖡꗍ. The proper concept is as near 
to real criminal trial as has ever been done in real life. I mean by this, 
not even the OJ Trial. The OJ or Johnny Dep style trials is precisely not 
what we want to do.  I am thinking more like New Zealand criminal court 
proceedings, at the highest level, white collar crime stuff.  There is no 
sensationalism involved at all. (So also not the Winston Peters' Winebox 
inquiry style, which was political theatre for an ideologue's benefit --- 
albeit the actual case was a real example of criminal cover-up.)

I guess this would make the production ever _more_ hyper-real_ or really 
surreal, since without media/press sensationalism it would not be like 
the real world. You know the deal, more like old school leftist BBC or 
Swedish cinema rather than commercial crap Hollywood production style. 
Keep the ꖀ𐝥ꗍꖡꕯꖦꗞꖹꕷ Peter Jackson away from it too. 

(Is there anything more 
British imperialist fascist than LOTR? Sauron was the anti-hero all along, 
the pinko commie nice guy?  A good guy, but demonized and propagandized to 
all heck by the drug cartel funded Shire, and portrayed as an evil SOB in 
order to perpetuate the fascist Elvin security deep state mafia?)

So... the one time ever I might _ever_ say this: "Like, subscribe and share!"
