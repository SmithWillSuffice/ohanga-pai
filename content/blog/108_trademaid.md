Darren Quinn just put out yet another go at the trade story.  I thought this 
was settled years ago. Mosler/MMT is correct. 

Steve Keen was "Not Wrong."

Fadhel Kaboub is still a bit of a dopey post-Keynesian.

Let's all go to sleep happy tonight in solidarity.

A reader on Darren's substack wrote:

Increasing our costs (exports) or decreasing our benefits results in an 
overall loss?'

I replied,

words in Darren's Preface at the end.


Darren's Preface was accurate, it stated, "Exports are a Rela lo Cost, Imports 
a Real Benefit."

But note to MMT crticis, that's just first order. If you import toxic sludge 
the it's not a benefit. naiton do this. New Zealand was importing Peter Theil 
and other monsters.

On real t erms of trade and soft currency systems, the best short article is 
still Forstater and Mosler's

[]()
it is not focused on trade, but gives you all the basic tools for analysis of 
international trade. Why? Because the mainstream nutjobs are always ferful of 
the exchange rate "going south". If you understand Forstater and Mosler you'll 
never have such baseless fears. 

## An MMT-101 on Trade

Exports are a REAL COST. Not a monetary cost. The meanings with currency 
flows are opposite to real goods flows. And the point is that this is 
asymmetric for human beings.  You far prefer the real goods flows. Since you 
cannot eat a dollar bill for lunch. (Though with sufficient government 
scorepoints in your bank account you might be able to bribe or threaten 
someone to give you their lunch without spending a dime.)

The real goods flow opposite to the currency flow. So never repeat that 
post-Keynesian/New Keynesian attack on MMT. They are lies or ignorance (one 
or the other). 

Exports are NOT a "$" cost. They are a REAL COST, and that makes all 
the difference.

The MMT point is that In the macro (whole system) the monetary cost is not 
a worry (it is for a household or firm in the micro), since your domestic 
economy can always be adjusted so the poorest do not miss out from changes 
in your real terms of trade (net flow of real goods), or for that matter 
from a change in the current account trade (intl. "$" flow) or forex rates. 

In other words, net importing is not a domestic deindustrialization or 
unemployment story, it is an increased living standards story. But corrupt 
or just innocently backwards government policy can turn it into something 
horrific, like deindustrialization and mass unemployment. You should ask 
yourself why the governments choose such policy? It's not a market force.
    
    
Steve Keen's talking point a while back was, "Well i don't trust the 
politicians to make the right domestic adjustments."  Sure, he's right to 
be distrustful, but this does not help, since the government will ñ•êñ•ïñ•êñ¢â things 
up regardless.  Witness Tariffman of recent times. In his old debate with 
Mosler, Keen was being too pedantic. (In any case, Mosler agreed that you do 
not want to depend on imports for strategic production that could be 
generated domestically, even if your domestic produciton in that case was 
inefficient, e.g.,  oil/gas and surgical masks to name just a couple of 
exmaples of a strategic resources.) 

## Domestic Policy is Critical

You want people to understand the truth, that the domestic adjustments can 
always be made, so a poorer nation in the global south can net import without 
it turning into a mass unemployment story or "borrowing from the IMF" story 
(completely needless and Íï∑Íñ°ÍñπÍòùÍïØÍïí). Because then the fault of failure in the 
domestic economy (i.e., unemployemnt and rising inequality) is clear, and 
ordinary people can then put presusure on their government to do the right 
thing, which is only possible when the government no longer has the excuses, 
(i) "We cannot find our own scorepoints," or (ii) "But the balance of 
payments constraint will risk hyperinflation."  Once people know those myths 
are false, ordinary people can pressure governments to provide full decent 
quality social services and full employment, without having to go to the 
private market for cheap & nasty substitutes and expensive healthcare.

Free public healthcare is a REAL COST, not a monetary cost, it's the oposite 
of a $ cost. It is a monetary injection into the economy ‚Äî you could say a $ 
flow into the foreign sector, where foreign now just means "non-governemnt 
balance sheets". But it withdrawls real labour and medical supplies from out 
of the priavte sector. So the same as the trade story essentially.
