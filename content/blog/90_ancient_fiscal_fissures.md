I was reading-up on history of imperialism recently --- you know, because 
the Leftist hair-on-fire types annoy me about as much as the blithering idiot 
Neocons. Or perhaps it is just consuming too much of my news clippings 
from social media commentators is catching too much anti-establishment 
fluff in the old daily news fishing net.

Anyway, what you hear often from a steady stream of Anti-establishment types 
(who range widely on the political spectrum from extreme left-wing to 
libertarian right-wing) is that 

> <div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px"> "US Empire is about to collapse!"</div>

It is cringe stuff.

## Big Whimpers
 
Empires do not just go away like this popular conception (or, let's say, 
the conception that I thought-was-popular-but-only-in-my-own-head-since-
I-do-not-pay-much-attention-to-what-most-people-understand-of-history-of-empire
‚Äî you know, _that_ sort of garden variety uncomplicated conception). 

But take the Soviet Union for example. The system of governance collapsed, 
but the Russian State did not, it was split up, but hardly a 
collapse of Russia. And what matters is the People. Not the system of 
government. The same oligarchs held on to power in Russia who existed in 
the former Soviet Union. Hardly a collapse of anything. But, ok, it was a 
massive shock administratively.

I doubt anything similar will occur for the USA, but if there is a massive 
re-organization of government in the USA, it will not vanquish the might of 
the USA that has not already been diminished. It might even strengthen the 
USA, who knows. The key will be to excise the unholy madness of the 
Trumpistas. If they burn-out, the establishment might be back but perhaps 
with humbler ambitions for the billionaires, and greater ambitions for 
the working class? Well... one can dream.

(I did hear a whisper somewhere recently that some former Obamarites have 
grown a conscience.)

But yes, I am already looking ahead of the Trump--MarsKing reign. I think it 
will be clownish and the shortest monarchy in world history. Holding real 
power will still be the oligarchs when the Mar-a-Lago bulldozer dust settles.

Also, I really could not care if the USA gets split up into several 
sovereign states. That could be a very good thing... for some, horrid 
for others. But the balance of the break-up effect is impossible to guess. 
Or even if there will be a break. My feeling from working in the USA is 
that the ordinary people of the USA have a strong enough cultural identity 
and can remain a united power. They are not united under a vision of 
themselves as a complete imperialist economic colonial ñß•ñ®öñ®öñ¶ôñ•ïÍõöñ†¢s, but they 
do share a national multicultural identity that is richer than 
they might give themselves credit for collectively (because the cult 
of the individual is also strong).

Most people in the USA do not want this status as international pariahs 
and neo-imperialists. If the government of the USA listens to their people, 
all should be fine. 

That's enough Crystal Ball gazing. I suck at it.

Using the Timestone called a "history book" I was wandering back centuries 
and reading that my dopey na√Øve thought that the big grand stories of 
collapses of empires was a bit mythical, was largely true. While a 
"great leader" is often a man mounted on 
a house of cards, the people of the empire are more resilient than the 
names at the top, and tend to always persist. How could they not? You 
cannot exterminate or assassinate a culture.

Some dude said, was it T.S. Eliot? "The world ends not in a bang, but 
with a whimper."

Such seems to be the way great empires get rolled up. The time span in 
the historical accounts seems compressed when you read it, but taking a 
sober look at the dates involved the process tends to (for most empires 
which fade) to be very slow. Not Soviet Union style at all.

It is remarkable the Russians did it twice in a century. If you consider the 
Soviets to have been pretty Empirical. (Physics nerd puns are the worst.)
Although, I do not know much about the Tsarist regime, I think from 
accounts I've read about the Bolshevik revolution that the Tsar was 
pretty darn weak in the end well before the revolution, so this had been 
a slow decline too. 

A good history work detailing rise and fall of empires, recommended by 
[The Burning Archive](https://www.youtube.com/@theburningarchive) host 
Jeff Rich, is John Darwin's _After Tamerlane_. It confirms what I had 
always thought was fishy. Although, to be honest I have little time or 
pleasure to read history, so it is possible it was my false impression 
of History as taught that was at fault? Perhaps all the scholars would 
say, "Yeah, empires never really collapse like that!"

## History Buffs, Buffing up the metals

There are two things I want to comment upon now. 

1. The accounts of the historians get the money story wrong I believe. They 
talk about "fiscal crises" but are not giving us the more accurate historical 
account.
2. For the USA today a "collapse" or reform of US government will not 
necessarily be a collapse through "collapse of the US dollar".

I am going to take the Safavid Persians and Indian Moguls as my study for 
the first.

The orthodox history buff idea is that the rulers needed to collect 
"revenue" --- in order to get their own currency!

Complete bollocks. Why do the history buffs, who are _supposed_ to be 
excellent with words, not understand the meaning of the word _revenue_?

The far more realistic account of empire collapse or retreat is that they 
get over-extended and run out of real resources to support the army (or 
mercenaries or whoever). Sometimes the peasants revolt too, if they are 
sending a high revenue burden back to the rulers. 

But we know _that_ revenue side of the sorry! The peasants cannot create 
the currency, so when they are forced to return it they lose spending 
power and social fabric and community cohesion is destroyed. This is 
the cohesion and unity that truly maintains empire. The history books 
often tell this story skewed.  Afterall, we are not talking about just 
continual barbarian hoards one after another.  Most empires are peaceful-like.
(Hey, relative terms ok! "Nasty brutish and short" is peaceful 
compared to "Violent sadistic and over-in-a-flash".)

The extensions of empire are always after more real resources, the 
minerals, the silk, the food, and sometimes... yes, sometimes also the gold 
and silver (fine thing for decoratively equipping a non-fighting army with).

In demanding gold and silver the elites are undermining their empire. 
They are making the peasant work in ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° jobs. But, you know, it 
can work for a while.


## Safavid Monetary System

Let's examine the Safavids then, who supposedly had a fiscal crisis or 
two (reduction in those revenues). I will sprinkle in a few links for the 
history buffs.

During the Safavid era in Persia, the primary state currency was the 
 øabbƒÅsƒ´, named after Shah  øAbbƒÅs I (1581--1629. The  øabbƒÅsƒ´ was issued in 
both 
[silver and gold tokens](http://pierre-marteau.com/wiki/index.php?title=Persia%3AMoney), 
with silver being the more common form. Other 
denominations included the ≈°ƒÅhƒ´, mo·∏•ammadƒ´, and t≈´mƒÅn (as a 
[unit of account](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abbasi)).
Double entry book-keeping was around, and the
[Safavid and Qaja administration](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/fiscal-system-iv-safavid-and-qajar-periods) was not far off what we do today.

It is fair to say that the Safavid currency was partially tax-driven, but 
not exclusively so. Several factors contributed to the demand for the 
ruler's currency. Let's run through them:

1. **Tax collection:** The Safavid state collected taxes in its official 
currency, which created a consistent demand for it. Taxes were levied 
on land, trade, and various economic activities, requiring subjects to 
acquire the state's currency to meet their obligations. Lo! Basic MMT.
2. **Administrative payments:** High Safavid officials were paid salaries 
and entitlements, often through land grants (toy≈´l) and special tax 
assessments, which were likely denominated in the state currency.
3. **Trade and commerce:** The  øabbƒÅsƒ´ and other Safavid coins were used in 
domestic and international trade, creating additional 
[demand beyond tax purposes](http://pierre-marteau.com/wiki/index.php?title=Persia%3AMoney). Lo! The non-government sector also desires to 
save in the tax credits.
5. **Minting control:** The Safavid rulers maintained control over 
minting, farming out the mint to private persons who were obliged to 
bring foreign money to the public mint, thus ensuring the circulation 
of state currency.

This is an MMT system if ever I saw one.

Periodic reforms, such as those implemented by Shah  øAbbƒÅs I, aimed to 
standardize the currency system and increase its use throughout the empire.

On point **3** it was clear 
[protection of trade routes](https://books.openedition.org/editionsmsh/11406?lang=en) was the main problem, not the revenues.

It's important to note that foreign currencies also circulated: 
Rixdollars, Spanish ryals, and other foreign coins were accepted and 
often converted to  øabbƒÅsƒ´s.  Lo and behold! A forex desk was in operation!
It might have been a floating exchange rate, in fact what else could it 
have been? The Safavids did not sem to have proper fixed exchange rate 
control from what I can tell. The MMT just keeps piling on.

[Different regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahmasp_I) within 
the Safavid empire used various currencies, such 
as the ak√ße in Shirvan and the tanka in Mazandaran, before monetary 
unification efforts in the 1570s.

[Towards the end of the Safavid period](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history-project-ap/xb41992e0ff5e0f09:unit-3-land-based-empires/xb41992e0ff5e0f09:3-1empires-expand/a/read-the-safavid-empire), 
the state faced economic difficulties, including currency devaluation and 
shortages of silver, which affected the stability and demand for the official 
currency. Which is an indication even back then the "economists" did not 
grasp the function of the state/empire currency authority.

Thus while tax collection was a significant driver of demand for the 
Safavid currency, it was part of a broader economic system that 
included trade, administrative payments, and sometimes backwards 
monetary policies, all of which contributed to the currency's use 
and circulation but also unnecessary "fiscal crises".

The point is though, it was still MMT. The taxes drove the demand for 
the currency. Devaluation was not a silver supply problem, it was a problem 
of lack of understanding (probably all around, but certainly among the 
elites)  of the tax system.  When a whole system effect get's mentally 
locked-in, and everyone thinks the _silver_ literally _is the money_ then 
bad things will result.


## The Moghuls

A similar story can be told under the reign of the 
[Great Ahkbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Mughal_Empire) 
across India and what is now Pakistan.

However, it appears their 
[goldbug mentality](https://cards.algoreducation.com/en/content/hoRkFsV4/mughal-monetary-system) 
was more severe than the Safavids. They really did believe in metallic 
purity of coinages. So it is no wonder they suffered (needless) fiscal 
crises. 

It was clearly an MMT system. Akbar replaced the previous tribute system 
with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency. I doubt pure Tribute 
systems (real goods given) ever function for any large disparate empire, the 
scaling is all wrong. (But I do not know, it just _seems_ impossible.)

The Moghals did attempt to manage the relationship between face value 
and intrinsic value. For example, the ratio of dam (copper coin) to 
rupee fluctuated over time, from 48:1 at the start of Akbar's reign to 
38:1 in the 17th century, and eventually 16:1 by the 1660s. This suggests 
an awareness of changing metal values and attempts to adjust accordingly.

But this is more like managing a commodity peg. They needed the metal 
resources to manage the peg. It was madness. But obviously people of the 
day did not realize. The peasant communities they conquered were probably 
functioning more like pure communists(!) The records of account were all 
in their heads. So when the coins came along from Ahkbar they were not wise 
to the "scam" so-to-speak. Someone somewhere was digging up metals to put 
into a numeraire to support false consciousness. Where these the first 
ever truly ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° jobs in history (apart from the courtesan stuff).

Once the metallic value exceeds the coin face value, there is inevitable
defacing et cetera. So the Moghul system cannot truly have been a 
metal standard. The metal intrinsic value had to have been an impediment 
to trade efficiency I would think, not a bonus. It means people think 
they desire the metal in the coin, but if the face value is higher the 
metal is irrelevant, and in fact a big waste and inefficiency. Indeed, it 
is an inherent instability. Did the Moghuls perhaps not realize this?
Seems so.

It is interesting to note the 
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire) 
stating the misunderstanding openly and naked:

> "The base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, 
instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar. These taxes, which 
amounted to well over half the output of a 
[peasant cultivator](https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC), 
were paid in the well-regulated silver currency, and 
[caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire#CITEREFAsherTalbot2006)."

History goldbuffer dude! Where dd the merchants get the tokens from in 
the first place? Out their Mint ñß•ñ®öñ®öñ†¢ñ®ö? 

Now, it is possible Ahkbar had some merchants mint the coins themselves, 
but this is not clear, and I highly doubt it. The administration was known 
in high repute for excellent standardization, which means the officials
likely closely controlled the minting. No one could get a reap of rupee 
until the empire spent it.

It is tragic: you have an MMT system but do not know it. How much 
historic tragedy are we talking about now? It is not just 20th century 
Neoliberalism causing collapse and crisis and unemployment.

History records a "fiscal crisis". But it was not the lack of tax revenue 
that was the problem, that was a symptom. The problem was over-extending 
empire, and the need to protect trade routes, because of overwhelming 
demand for the real resources available. Requiring extra metal resources 
for the coins was a terrible mistake. Shoulda' used tally sticks Mr Ahkbar.

When real supply is pressured, the revenues collapse. The tax revenue is 
the _ex poste_ accounting evidence of a strong productive economy, it is 
not the funds for the Empire.
I suspect there are very few history books that state this explicitly, 
which is a great shame. Although, like I wrote, I am not a history buff 
so have not read widely enough to say for certain the buffs are still 
buffering the fake knowledge of metals and money.

Also, to end this bit, because the rulers probably falsely believed the 
metal was the money, they probably caused the fiscal crises, needlessly.
Or was it? I still would say the over-extended need for real resources, and 
likely loss of control over corruption, is what devalues the currency and 
if the Ruler/Authority does not issue more tokens to satisfy the rise 
in nominal demand (i.e., fails to accommodate the inflation) then bad 
things are bound to happen. All the more so if pegging to the metal 
standard.

Lesson for history: you'd better know what you are standardizing for! 

If you are the Ruler you always accommodate the inflation. Meanwhile, get 
the army to work shoring up supply which is the cause.  Not plundering, 
but building. You do not want real supply efforts to be digging around 
for metals for a stamped coin.

We cannot ever underestimate the stupidity of Ruler Elites and their 
material greed. Throughout history they are often their own undoing, and the 
empires they inherit go out with mostly whimpers.



## USA Today

It is almost absurd to think the USA will collapse due to fiscal 
ineptitude. But stranger things have happened. I'll not go back to 
the Crystal Ball. Instead I am gong to wildly speculate by looking at 
the crumbs on my keyboard --- there are none to be seen, such not much 
to divine.

I will just bookmark that already the collapse on 
the fiscal side due to the MarsKing Reign of PayPal Phreaks is unlike 
in anceint times.  The US dollar system is robust but also far more 
significant than ancient tax driven systems. So in the USA today the 
collapse of sales is likely to be so fast and so severe the lunatics will 
be thrown out probably by Trump himself once Mar-a-Lago &c., sales plummet, 
or the CIA get involved.

The CIA is not exactly a Mont Pelerin institution, but I rather 
feel most of their experts are neck deep in stupid goldbug monetarist 
groupthink mud, but even they might dimly understand the gold at 
Fort Knox is not the thing worth protecting but the payments system is 
the thing for national security preservation. Preservation of the 
rentiers, Wall Street, Venture Capitalists first and foremost, and 
then all the rest.
