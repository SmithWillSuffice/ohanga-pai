Yesterday I was fortunate enough to receive an email with a fresh cup of Mosler.

I had posted the following to an MMT discussion group.
> Recently Brian Romanchuck and Dougald Lamont blogged a bit about inflation.
[Lamont here](https://dougaldlamont.substack.com/p/this-one-chart-destroys-conservative) 
and [Romanchuk here](https://bondeconomics.substack.com/p/comments-on-asset-prices-and-inflation).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamont writes about a chart showing Canada oil 
price history: "What it illustrates, in very clear terms, is that inflation of 
oil prices - which drive consumer inflation - are due to conflicts and political events..."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question for the mmt googlegroup: is it a fair 
critique if I reply to Lamont pointing out there is also a monopolist (OPEC+) 
setting price? It begs the question how influential "politics" and "conflict" 
are, and which direction causality goes. Major war in the Donbas or 
Middle East can certainly impact supply, but the monopolist is still the price 
setter, right? So it is really down to how political and conflict events 
disturb the leisure of the oil monopolist. (That'd be my challenge for 
inflationistas. Is the oil monopoly going to continue raising price? But 
then are central banks going to think they need to raise rates to "fight the 
inflation" \[cough!\]? Leading to sustained inflation!!!)
Regards to all.

As is almost typical, Warren chimed in with a one-liner.
> "I've called it duelling monopolies. The currency monopolist vs the oil 
monopolist."

OK, so maybe not fresh Mosler, but it was fresh for me.

It is another one of those macroeconomics points that really *only* an MMT 
expert will comprehend. It is ""highly macro". It is recognition the source of the price level is with the monopolist.

If there is no monopolist then something else is governing the price level, 
whatever anchor or lack of anchor that may be. However, the MMT historians 
point is that since the dawn of monetary systems (records of credits and 
debits, held in people's heads or collective memory, or clay tablets, or these 
days computer records) there has *always* been a currency monopoly.

You cannot find single currency regions outside of systems of mere bank 
clearing, like the Banco del Giro, that are absent a currency monopolist. 
Whether they *know* they are the source of the price level or not is an 
interesting and highly relevant question for social equity. But operationally 
there is no denying almost all currencies since inception have had a monopoly 
issuer.

Since the oil supply these days is not the currency monopolist, and energy is 
the driver of all non-finacialized${}^\ast$ real economies, 


${}^\ast$OK, nerds. Financialized economies do run on fast computers for 
those parasitic traders. The point is, we do not need financialization. It is 
an obscene parasitic layer, completely unnecessary.


### Mosler Round 2

The next day Warren followed up with another succinct email concerning the 
response a nation has to a foreign monopoly setting oil prices.
> "To continue, with the duelling monopolies/price setters, when the Saudis 
raise prices, our choices include, for example:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allow the relative price of oil and products that contain 
oil to rise accordingly, while all other prices remain the same. This would be 
a reduction in our real terms of trade and diminish our real wealth 
accordingly, and the reverse for the Saudis. And it's what they would 
prefer --- get more for their oil in real terms.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Allow our entire price level to shift up accordingly such 
that real terms of trade remain as before. There would be no shift in real 
wealth."

### MMT Comprehension

Here is the way to understand these matters.

The government, form inception, first issues the currency. It functions as a 
tax credit.

**The Purpose*** --- is that the government *needs to provision the public sector*.
But in *real terms* not nominal (currency) terms.)

Explain it this way to your friends. This way you do not cause moral panic 
excitations in the fibre of the whole being when you say taxes and bond sales 
do not finance government spending.

The tax liability (not the tax receipt) creates a demand for the currency, 
and sociologically an insatiable demand, this allows the government to hire 
real resources. Why? Because the government just created millions of people 
who want to accept the currency in exchange for their goods or labour. There 
does not even need to be any bank in existence except a scoreboard at one 
central bank. And there were no "tax payers" before the government imposed 
the tax liabilities.

Taxes *do* "fund* the government --- in real terms, not monetary terms. 
Finding the money is never a problem, except politically and psychologically. 
Why is it a psychological problem? Because the idiots in charge (however well 
educated, MENSA level IQ, and worldly knowledgeable) do not understand the 
monetary operations. So tell them!
