Change of pace from recent posts today. I revert like a child to hard scifi 
when depressed and unable to focus. 
[Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still... it 
did the job.  However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the 
novels is now screening, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that's an opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some 
major fodder from for writing for popular consumption.

Geeky stuff out of the way first?

## Chaos Theory

The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable. 
Henri Poincare was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to 
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general 
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically 
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge 
in prediction from reality.

In the 1960's the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple 
model of "weather" (fluid convection). Eventually some heterodox economists 
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium, 
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leader in 
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable 
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and 
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling.  This is due to the 
whole ideological indoctrination that "perfect markets" thinking does for you. 
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only 
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. ðŸ¤£

((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a 
little neoclassical baby?))

But that's not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are 
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good 
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy 
round-tables you crank.

### Instability versus Unpredictability

One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look 
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no 
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$ 
with in swishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because 
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price 
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at 
relative prices).

Sadly this is delusional.

${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity, 
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although 
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not 
appropriate.

The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbit about an ideal 
equilibrium. They are quasi-periodic motions far-from-equilibrium. But this 
does not mean the economy is unstable. It means it is unpredictable. There is 
a big difference.


## Remembrance of Earth's Past

Whoa! Cixin Liu is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little 
over-rated. I loved _Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu_ when I was a teenager, but 
when I matured I better understood why the Monte Python skit is even funnier 
than it first appears.  The Proustian romance and pathos is one thing, but 
you really can't appreciate it until you've lived a good life and have 
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. I sometimes wonder what 
my life would be like if I had been sparred all the heartache and sorrow? 
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.

Anyhow, I guess I will have some thing to say about the politics of hard 
scifi, and will use the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy as a case 
study, since... why not?  *Game of Thrones* is over-cooked by now.

For scifi fans, I'd recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or 
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in 
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal 
average "ADHD" (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a 
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama.

### The Premise

I'll be writing as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge of the plot 
twists.

I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about 
his politics.  To summarize, he's a little bit apolitical, but has this weird 
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization... 
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has 
[offended some scifi fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI). 
It is propaganda?  Whoa!

But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn't put an author's political 
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political 
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as 
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember *The Matrix*?

I will confess then that I liked the premise of *Remembrance of Earth's Past*. 
The one-liner "Physics does not exist, and never will exist" is pretty good.
WHy? IUt is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a 
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for 
how the heck physics cannot exist! 

In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the 
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures, or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.

Newtons' Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein's gravity, quantum mechanics --- 
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the 
interaction of matter and spacetime.

Hence, and Lui Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.

This opens up a panoply of something like a Matrix universe, one that is 
programmed and at the whim of the "universal programmer". (Wolfram physics 
ya nerds! ðŸ¤£)  I cannot tell if that is where Lui Cixin takes the story, but 
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not 
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin'.'
