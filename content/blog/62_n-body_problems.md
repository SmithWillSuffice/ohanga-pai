## The Turkey Economists

Are our mainstream economists turkeys or flat-worlders? 

### Farmer versus Shooter Models

Change of pace from recent posts today. I revert like a child to hard scifi 
when depressed and unable to focus. 
*[Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))*
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still... it 
did the job.  However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the 
novels is now streaming, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that's an 
opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some 
major fodder from while writing for popular consumption.

Geeky stuff out of the way first?

## Chaos Theory

The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable. 
Henri Poincaré was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to 
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general 
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically 
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge 
in prediction from reality.

In modern times exact solutions have been found, but they are incredibly 
special, and do not occur naturally. They are what you would call mathematical 
results, not truly physical. (That is so even if we ignored effects of quantum 
mechanics and general relativity.)  This is a major plot failure in 
*The Three Body Problem*, since the humans attempting to solve the solar 
system calendar problem for the Trisolarians would know the Newtonian problem 
is not physical. In the novels this is turned into a feature, since those 
humans are portrayed as pseudo-religious. They've wilfully, one presumes, 
ignored general relativity (time dilation effects). Presumably the attempt to 
Redeem humanity is merely an attempt to show the Trisolarians humans are 
capable of solving incredibly hard but useless mathematics puzzles. 
(<font style="color: #dab720;">Cryptocurrency</font> all over again! 🤣) Or at 
least that's they way I 
have to read the novel to enjoy it!

((Oh no! I can already feel this blog post is going to have the highest lol 
emoji density of them all.))

It has been a rather silent triumph of Twentieth and 21st century mathematics 
that stable solutions to the gravitational three body problem 
[have been discovered](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-023-10177-w), 
but no one was expecting this to be possible. However, it is still true that 
general solutions are nearly impossible to compute. 

When I write "impossible to compute" I have a technical result in mind, one 
can read more [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02312.pdf) and 
more for lay readers [here](https://blbadger.github.io/3-body-problem.html)

Remarkably, in 1912 Karl Fritiof Sundman proved there is a way to compute 
the general solution to the gravitational 3-body problem. Unfortunately it is 
totally impractical. In any case, the gravitational problem of most interest 
to us is for our solar system, which is what... a 10-body problem?${}^\dagger$ 
That means ignoring the moons of planets and the asteroid belt. So you might be 
surprised that in the real world solar systems are fairly stable even though 
mathematics says they should generically not be stable. The resolution is 
found in knowing the time scales involved.  NASA or any future space engineers, 
can safely plot trajectories for spacecraft on year-long time scales because 
the typical time periods over which our solar system becomes unpredictable are 
extremely long in duration. Also, space navigators do not need to know 
analytical solutions, they can compute approximate trajectories numerically 
with decent precision. Again, that's because they are operating with time 
scales far shorter than that of the orbits of the planets and moons.

(${}^\dagger$A reddit'er, who else, points out the Trisolarians face a 4-body 
problem, since they have three Suns, plus their planet.😂 Completely missing 
the point that on a calendar prediction time-scale the perturbations of a 
planet on a star are truly negligible. Even with chaotic motion. If you cannot 
measure the initial configuration of the three stars within a millimetre, then 
your puny planet's effect will be less than the chaotic motion divergence.)

Also, to emphasize the point: instability and predictability are totally 
different concepts. Our solar system is both, it is for sure 
unpredictable, but might also be unstable. However this matters little to 
human space explorers because the time over which planetary motions get 
unpredictable is on the order of years or maybe centuries (I am not exactly 
sure of the typical time period off the top of my head), not days or years.
Even if our solar system is stable over millions of years (no planets will 
collide or shoot off to infinity) it is still unpredictable over perhaps 
thousand year intervals. That just means we need a lot more data to predict 
where planets will be exactly in a thousand years compared to next year. 
We'd need much more than a thousand times as much precision data.

In the 1960's the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple 
model of "weather" (fluid convection). Eventually some heterodox economists 
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium too
(will wonders never cease), 
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leaders in 
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable 
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and 
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling.  This is due to the 
whole ideological indoctrination that "perfect markets" thinking does for you. 
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only 
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. 🤣

((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a 
little neoclassical baby?))

But that's not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are 
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good 
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy 
round-tables you crank.

### Instability versus Unpredictability

One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look 
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no 
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$ 
with in wishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because 
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price 
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at 
relative prices).

Sadly this is delusional.

${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity, 
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although 
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not 
appropriate.

In fact delusions of this nature are more akin to illusions. Like seeing Jesus 
in the Turin Shroud. The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbits 
about an ideal equilibrium. They are (generically) quasi-periodic motions 
far-from-equilibrium. But this does not mean the economy is unstable. It means 
it is unpredictable. There is a big difference.

Chaotic systems can of course also be unstable. Our Solar System is thought to 
be unstable, though no one can prove it for sure, what a dynamicist can do is 
point out our solar system is generically unstable, meaning it would be pretty 
lucky if it were stable. They can also tell us the characteristic time scale for 
instability (the time period up until which the motions of the Sun and our 
neighbouring planets is constrained to more or less fixed orbits). I forget 
the number, but the characteristic period is probably on the order of 
billions of years. The Sun could die out before any of our planets go haywire 
and shoot off to interstellar "infinity" or two planets collide. (Don't quote 
me on this. If you want to know then pull up a DuckDuckGo or 
[Perplexity ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-is-the-.jbJwrp1QFyYXpb47IhKyg) tab.)
About 17 billion years before any likely major planetary collision?

### Hard scifi Gripes?

I have no interest in critiquing the "Physics of Three Body". But I can't 
help myself. You can search youtube for people doing reaction videos to 
*Three Body Problem*, and so I might be entirely redundant. What I do care 
about is being a bit of a hard scifi snob. My attitude is why put in fantasy 
elements into a good scifi story if you could instead make it far more 
interesting with heavy realism?

The honest truth is there is far too much physics that gets stretched in 
*Three Body* the novel than I have time or patience to critique, so I'm 
letting it rest, except for when there is an interesting literary angle to 
comment upon.

The first one worth mentioning is the 3BP virtual reality game character, 
von&nbsp;Neumann. He and the game's Isaac Newton, along with the main 
protagonist Wang Miao, convince a feudal emperor to build a human computer, 
with 30 million soldiers doing essentially mindless logic gate tasks. The 
trouble with this plot line is that they appear to be building a general 
purpose computer. What I'd have done is construct a single purpose 30 million 
solider machine. Less prone to error, faster compute. However, this is truly a 
pedantic gripe, because Liu Cixin writes the correct realist reason the 30 million 
soldier computer fails to predict the Trisolar orbits --- namely the Newtonian 
dynamics model lacked general relativity corrections.

Knowing this, you might ask why the classical three body problem to this day 
still attracts some mathematicians? I cannot tell you why, except that 
mathematicians are fond of torture.

((In the novels this is attributed to the psychological acquisition of a 
false religion, a pseudo-religion, among the Redemptionist faction of the ETO. 
They begin to simply believe as a matter of faith that *if* they solve the 
three body problem the Trisolarians will leave Earth alone. By the way, this 
fits my definition of *religion* --- which is "A source of Good."  The 
Redemptionists believe their solving the 3BP will lead to good for all, so 
it is at least a pseudo-religion. It is also a false religion because their 
solving the 3BP is not a source of Good. It is merely a source of interesting 
mathematics which is morally neutral, inapplicable to the real world.))

Why are mathematicians so fond of torture? Why would they work on a Newtonian 
mechanics problem that has no real world applications?

I imagine their response would be, "Sure, sure general relativity makes the 
three body problem pure art, not science. But so what? Mathematics is *art*!"

I happen to agree with this attitude. But you should know it is painful art. 
One never knows when a piece will be finished, nor whether certain subjective 
standards of elegance will be met. Often the aesthetics really suck. But the 
humble mathematician indulges in this tortuous art anyway. 

Applied Mathematics is very different, for here one does seek utility in 
physics or other sciences, and no one alive today working on the Newtonian 
three body problem would be accused of being an applied mathematician.

However... if someone ever did figure out an efficient algorithm for real-time 
Newtonian dynamics, it is possible it might find a real world application. 
But because solar system dynamics does require general relativity, it would 
not be an application in astronomy or space travel... or I guess it could be 
used for very short time-scale trajectory computations, where effects of 
general relativity are negligible.

For normies: I cannot easily describe why general relativity turns astronomy 
dynamics into a nightmare, you'll have to take it upon authority it does. 
The equations for general relativity are so severely difficult to compute 
that exact solutions are known only for truly incredibly symmetric spacetimes, 
and they are... what?... less than a handful in number, and totally useless 
for astronomical applications. (Fascinatingly, these maximally symmetric 
solutions are very useful in theoretical work, because a couple of them 
describe ideal approximations to at least two very important real physical 
phenomena: the entire cosmos, and rotating black holes.)

Having said that, with enough computing power general relativistic systems, 
like colliding black holes, can be pretty well simulated these days, so the 
lesson there is with gargantuan enough compute power, the classical three 
body problem has about the same status as a relativistic gravitational problem. 
All of them are hard problems in real applications. 

The astounding thing is that the Newtonian three body problem is so damn 
hard! It should be a lot easier than a typical GR calculation, but in 
computational algorithmic terms the problems are about the same. This is 
typical for chaotic dynamics. If the system has any non-linearity, then,

* the computations to solve the system numerically will be hard, 
* they'll all be about as hard as each other for the same $N$.
* The bigger $N$ the worse, exponentially so, so extremely frickin' harder.

and it gets even more interesting,

* Once $N$ becomes truly gargantuan, the $N$-body problem can be immensely 
simplified to the point of "solvability" --- this occurs when there are so 
many molecules that the entire system can be coarsely described on a large 
scale using statistical mechanics.

With statistical mechanics we give up worrying about what any one body is 
doing, entirely, we are not interested in the single body trajectories, and 
instead we define macroscopic variables, like temperature, pressure, volume, 
density, and these fictional variables are then treated as new higher order or 
emergent variables. Even if the molecular dynamics are highly chaotic, the 
macroscopic variable time evolution can, under strict conditions, be simple 
and solvable. The class of such solvable statistical mechanics systems are 
those in equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium.

This has concern for my macroeconomics and political economy allegory. The 
macroeconomic system we live within is --- luckily${}^\ddagger$ --- not in thermal equilibrium 
in any sense. This is essentially why neoclassical economics does not work.
(And also why, perhaps to the chagrin of some socialists, why Austrian School 
economics is not entirely stupid. The Austrians are dummies only because they 
think gold is currency and "free markets" are possible, neither of which is 
true, so in the end they are as rotten as the neoclassicals. Being half-right 
in a field where Justice and Trust matter is as good as being all wrong.)

${}^\ddagger$"Luckily" because an economic system in equilibrium would mean we 
are all dead.... or all Borg.

As the baby of all hard chaos dynamics problems, the three body problem has 
a sort of mythic status. That is another reason why pure mathematicians might 
like the problem. (By the way, the Trisolarians, like humans, would have known 
this well before being capable of interstellar travel.)  How would we know 
macroeconomic systems are in a state of equilibrium?  We would know if the 
macroeconomics could be well-described by a small number of dynamical variables 
(analogies to temperature, volume, density &c.)

In fact, our macroeconomic systems (taken per country, say) are 
far-from-equilibrium systems, but also not totally anarchic. There are 
macroscopic observables that can usefully describe the time evolution of a 
macroeconomy. The analogy is like a complicated fluid, or the weather. 
Although this is only a very weak analogy.

In particular, while the Sun tends to monopolize the behaviour of our weather, 
governments tend to monopolize the behaviour of our macroeconomics. And to 
extend the analogy somewhat comically, while the Sun does not know what it is 
doing to us, nor do politicians in government know what they are doing to the 
macroeconomy.  I take this *not* as an argument against government and for 
anarchy, but rather an argument for a better informed and educated 
government. If you have something as powerful as the Sun but exists next door 
at room temperature and has eyes and ears and an email account, it could be 
a good idea to use it for the greater Good.

Does that sound like an endorsement of authoritarianism to you? It should not, 
but to see why... read onwards!


## Remembrance of Earth's Past

Whoa! Liu Cixin is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little 
over-rated. I loved reading _À la Recherche du Temps Perdu_ when I was a 
teenager, but when I matured I better understood why the Monty Python skit is 
even funnier than it first appears.  The Proustian romance and pathos is one 
thing, but you really can't appreciate it until you've lived a good life and have 
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. Same for 
Mishima's _Sea of Fertility_  --- even in translation it was a heck of a 
trilogy to read, and a masterpiece of Japanese literary art, all despite 
Yukio Mishima's warped politics and odd-duck lifestyle. I sometimes wonder 
what my life would be like if I had been spared all the heartache and sorrow? 
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.

Anyhow, I guess I will have something to say about the politics of hard 
scifi, and will use the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy as a case 
study, since... why not?  *Game of Thrones* is over-cooked by now.

For scifi fans, I'd recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or 
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in 
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal 
average "ADHD" (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a 
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama. I guess they've evolved eyeballs that 
can flicker in sync with subtitle display frequency with no conscious mental 
effort.

### The Premise

I'll be writing in real-time as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge 
of the plot twists.

I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about 
his politics.  To summarize, he's a little bit apolitical, but has this weird 
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization... 
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has 
[offended some scifi fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI). 
Is _Remembrance of Earth's Past_ really Chinese state propaganda?  Whoa!

But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn't put an author's political 
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political 
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as 
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember *The Matrix*?

At worst, dumb-dumb politics ruins the novel immersive experience, so it's 
depressing. But I rarely get angry and fumed up about it, no novelist is 
perfect, and life is too short to write angry letters to artists telling them 
their politics suck.

I will confess then that I liked the premise of *Remembrance of Earth's Past*. 
The one-liner "Physics does not exist, and never will exist" is pretty good.
Why? It is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a 
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for 
how the heck physics cannot exist! 

In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the 
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures, 
or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study 
of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.

Newton's Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein's gravity, quantum mechanics --- 
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the 
interaction of matter and spacetime.

Hence, and Liu Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the 
symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.

This opens up a panoply of something like a *Matrix* universe, one that is 
programmed and at the whim of the "universal programmer". (Wolfram physics 
ya nerds! 🤣)  I cannot tell if that is where Liu Cixin takes the story, but 
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not 
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin'.

Having not yet gotten to the crux of *Three Body Problem*, I have to insert my 
own bit of politics.


## Harder scifi

I reckon you can take *Remembrance of Earth's Past* as poetic allegory. I am 
damn sure this is not what Liu Cixin was thinking, but I'm telling you this 
is one way I can absorb the whole idea looming in *Three Body Problem*.
Which metaphors then? Well, you can say "Capitalism does not exist, and never 
will exist". But that's almost too comical.

Or is it?

The way I think of the Marxist counter to capitalism is as a bit of a fantasy. 
Neither the capitalists nor the marxists are theorising about reality as far 
as I can tell. Their economics does not exist.  So I'd get my proper poetic 
analogy via "Economics does not exist".

As allegory I'd take this to mean our economy surely exists (as does matter 
and spacetime probably in *Remembrance of Earth's Past*? Not yet sure!) The 
problem is that what *economists think* economics *is* is totally unreal. 
That'd be my poetic take on the *Three Body Problem* story. 

The only trouble is this is a *good* thing, whereas in the *Three Body Problem* 
it is supposedly getting teed up as a bad thing? ("Physics does not exist" is 
some sort of incipient war on science or intellectuals in the story?) 
In macroeconomics it is a damn good thing the marxists and neoclassicals 
preach bogus economics, because no one should ever be forced to live in their 
"gold is currency" and "capitalism is revolutionary" fantasy universe.

(Disclosure: I used to think "capitalism is the revolutionary force" was a 
fair enough theory. But a better grasp of neoliberalism has disabused me of 
this childish reading of marxism. Neoliberal capitalism has potential to 
persist on state life-support forever. F-o-r-e-v-e-r!!! How? 
UBI ya' sockcuckers! The revolutionary force, if there ever is to be one, has 
to be the spiritual capacity of people working together to overthrow tyranny 
and injustice. This is not "capitalism" by any definition.)

This is at least a nice way to enjoy the scifi story, because I am unable to 
enjoy it much as a physicist myself. It is too fantastical, so not good 
enough hard scifi. I cannot tolerate fantasy literature for long periods. 
Short stories with some sort of allegorical moral fable are ok, but the 
immersive fantasy literature stuff is to me like reading superhero comics. 
A complete waste of my time when I was a kid, like Commodore 64 video games.

I know adults indulge in these forms of entertainment, and a million people 
watch reality TV shows. I just don't understand it --- who has that amount of 
free time? Or... what the heck is wrong with me that I don't have such free 
time?

The reason *The Matrix* was cool was because you could read it as allegory for 
a materialistic society. Even if the Wachowski's did not intend for this to be 
the poetic reading. Who has you trapped in the real Matrix? You do. You 
and your ego and insatiable desires for material wealth and comforts. 
Agent Smith was, all said and done, a human invention. To extract yourself 
from the real Matrix you want to recognize what truly matters in your life. 
And that'd be love and kindness. Waking up from the real Matrix means becoming 
a more spiritual person.

In the macroeconomics/political economy allegory, Agent Smith is something 
like the White Supremacist or Neocon or Christian Fascist (they're not 
entirely disjoint categories). His "religion" is rule of the machines. Or not 
even that, it is rule by Agent Smith, beyond fascism (the nation is sacred) 
to total monarchy (the King is sacred). ((I always shed a tear for my friends 
in Thailand at such points in my thought. One nation within which a sizeable 
proportion of citizens still has a very unhealthy regard for their 
monarch.))

This leads to the extension of my allegory: humanity in our times is in fact 
gripped by the tentacles of an insidious sort of vague ideology. I'd call it 
neoliberalism, but it goes beyond the narrow meaning of that word. It extends 
to the whole plethora of false doctrines in economics, macroeconomics, sociology 
and politics that tells us human beings are mere animals and incapable of peace. 
The idea is we have to be competitive${}^\dagger$, this is how we survive, we 
have to dominate others, and moreover this is bred into us in our DNA... and 
so forth. I will not belabour the whole blackpill nihilist thesis, there are 
too many varieties, I'm just sketching the cartoon of the idea.  However, I 
do mean to refer to the real world.

${}^\dagger$Or, more extreme, the idea we do not have any choice in the 
matter, since we have no free will (the idiocy of Sam Harris, 
Robert Sapolsky and their like). (First define "free will" for me bros!))

It is a pervasive ideology, infecting popular culture and social discourse 
everywhere, and it is ruinous for the chances of a decent civilization. 
However, unlike nihilists, I believe humanity has the collective capacity to 
overcome this narrow dystopian world view. Call me an optimist, a hopeless 
romantic, but it is what I believe is possible. Just don't ask me to offer 
any probabilities. I'd say 100%, but have no clue what the time-frame would 
be. Asymptotics is easy, real-time dynamics is hard-to-impossible. But this 
is also not the topic of this article today.


## The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses

```
TODO:
* The concept in 3BP.
* How it appears in the allegory of modern political 
economy. The hapless Turkey, the Foolish Disk Worlder.
* The dis-analogy of it, and why some allegories are 
made to be motive to overcome the main problem.
```

Maybe I should not waste space expanding on the Turkey and the Flat worlder 
metaphors.  I think the better point to make is how this sets up a false 
dichotomy in the *Three Body* story. The viewpoint the reader is (supposedly) 
drawn to is this binary option: either we are like Turkeys thinking the dawn 
brings food every day, oblivious of the catastrophe of Thanks Giving; or we 
are Flat Worlders oblivious some 3D entity is toying with our world as if we 
were ants, meaning pretty oblivious of our cares and desires. 

Whether you go all Nihilist and pomo, or Nietzsche, in response may indicate 
some political persuasion, but I think I am an optimist (talking about our 
real world now) because I believe most ordinary people are capable of a more 
enlightened world view. The one where human beings might seem insignificant, 
but that we are nonetheless amazing creatures. As are any other alien 
civilizations in our universe who are sentient and have developed science 
and technology. 

The big lie is that sentience is a total accident.

We might not be Turkeys nor Flat Worlders. At any primitive time in human 
history maybe it seems that way, but that's an individualistic attitude, 
whereas I can both appreciate the worth of every individual creature, *and* 
imagine collectively life is something special.  There is also the point 
nihilists should consider, which is that even if life was not special, it 
might *become* special.  In my political economy allegory: neoliberalism is 
probably a transitory abomination.

I mean, why would you suppose we are accidents? Of course I know why, and I 
maintain a physics and a philosophy blog where I write more about such topics. 
But the short version would be we just cannot truly know, and yet we *could* 
very likely be a remarkable species. Being small in the universe does not 
equate with insignificance. (Isn't it a "very male" fallacy to consider size 
to be of any importance? Hence, most likely dead wrong? 🤣)

Size and mass are important for many things of course. But **(a)** get too 
massive and you eventually become a useless sucky black hole. **(b)** when 
size is not important is of most importance. In the spiritual realm *size* has 
a completely different meaning to anything physical. In the abstract, being 
a *spiritual giant* connotes great wisdom and compassion. In a physical world 
where spiritual beings subsist, this sort of size truly does matter. I always 
think of the output from mathematics and science to be inexorable companions 
of spiritual maturation. 

Another thing worth mentioning --- the eco-extremists. I've never found the 
extreme animal rights and eco-extremist people to be very spiritual. They, 
like the *Three Body* character Dr Ye Weinjie, and the even more extreme 
Mike Evans and Pan Han characters, have a jaundiced view of humanity. I lump 
them (rightly or wrongly) in the same category as Agent Smith in *The Matrix*. 
It'd be sad if Liu Cixin was among them, (is he?).  Half-way through the book 
it looks possible Ye Wenjie will turn to more compassion for humanity. (I guess 
it is nice for my depression that I am immersed enough in the book to care for 
her character!)

((Also, I wonder which character is Liu Cixin identifying with as author? Not 
that we need to care, but is it Ye Wenjie or Wang Maio --- or the Trisolarian! 
that'd be funny! 🤣  It is starting to become that sort of story where I care 
about the author's views, which is a bad sign. A sign of a poor writer. If it 
goes all full Authoritarian Big Daddy mode on us, I doubt I'll get to the 2nd 
and 3rd books. Having Mums and Dads is great. But it does not scale. I am 
pretty much now locked-in against solution by authoritarian rule.... even if 
it frickin' worked!))

The plot problem is really about how an individual's bitter experience can 
lead them to think of all of humanity as evil and irredeemable. It's an 
incredibly childish and self-centred attitude. The truth is, and I think 
most people are like this, we can save the animals, save the biosphere, and 
also love humanity. These are not contradictory or mutually exclusive 
options. To think otherwise is an imbecilic rotten apple fallacy.

I'd go further: the human species is not a cancer or plague, we are a natural 
outcome of life on Earth. So maybe have a little compassion for us too, as 
well as the swallows? 

By this account (and you have no reason to think I am correct, but I'll state 
it anyway) the greater a people are spiritually, the greater will be their 
science. The greater will be many of their aspects. Greater in *both* 
abstract spiritual and material advancement awesomeness. Moreover, in such wise 
a tiny insignificant creature on a mundane living planet, might reach out to 
the stars. It will not be long in the grand scheme of things before humans do 
reach the stars. By then, the "insignificance" of any one human might, I 
suppose, might still be regarded by fools as cause to think our lives have no 
cosmic importance, but to the more sagacious and wise it can be true one puny 
life has a lot of meaning, by virtue of its tiny insignificant contribution to 
the whole.

As I keep trying to remind some tentatively nihilist MMT friends who give up 
on elections for government, no one vote seems to count, but in fact they 
all do and that is the power of summation. Addition is a powerful thing.

Subtraction is also a powerful thing, once you get to zero you are dead. 

When people withhold their vote in elections they are ceding power to those 
who do vote, so it is disgusting defeatism. Using your vote to register a 
protest means voting for someone or something, not abstaining. Unless the 
result of mass abstinence is some good (abstain from voting when there is 
only one horrible choice). But if you abstain it seems morally incumbent upon 
you to exert great effort to create a better system where your vote is 
worthwhile, is it not?
 
I say, give up on political parties --- they are anathema for a decent 
society. But do not give up your vote.  Do not rely solely upon the collective 
power of a vote either.  All means available for peaceful revolution need to 
be employed.


## An Excellent Dialogue

About half way in to *Three Body Problem* the protagonist Wang Miao asks
the venerable and gentle Dr Ye Wenjie about "physics does not exist". 
She answers that it is not that physics does not exist, but that what we think 
is physics is wrong.

I'm not sure of the spin the Netflix adaptation will have on this, nor am I sure 
how this remark will play out in the original novels, but it is a crux... for 
me at least, worth writing about... and with my allegorical interpretation too.

Ye Wenjie likens scientists now to the Church of old, who thought Copernicus 
as guilty of heresy, Bruno and d'Ascoli worth the stake, and Galileo worth 
the Spanish Inquisition. She says, "Maybe we are like the Church." Meaning 
with respect to today's scientific apostates.

It is a lot less dramatic for physics these days though, than it is for 
political economy, since physics base marble is in pretty close contact with 
us now though particle accelerators and cosmology, and quantum computing of 
course (very base level, since the QC's are exploiting entanglement). 
Entanglement is the base marble of our universe, and perhaps it is no 
accident Schrödinger's Cat gets a mention in the immediately preceding scene 
with the detective Shi Qiang.

We are nowhere near the base marble of economics, but MMT is part of the base.
A huge gap remains in orthodox and even MMT-inspired political economy, and 
that is the spiritual realm, and I've not encountered any professional 
economists who even dare acknowledge this yet --- maybe there are a few like 
Kate Raworth or Jason Hickel, but I do not really know for sure, are they 
merely acting ethically because they think it good for themselves, or do 
they realize spiritual principles are at the very heart of true economics? 

Not just ecological principles, but spiritual principles. 
I suspect they do not acknowledge. They place the ecology ahead as primary, 
but this is a grave mistake, because we cannot have a sound ecosystem by just 
asserting ecology is important. Spiritual prerequisites are needed, even if 
only at a bare minimum level of political recognition that the ecological 
economics importance is something worth caring about.

If your economists do not care about ecology then nothing wil be done 
politically. The ecological economics academics can scream their heads off, 
it will only be when people dying is a clear consequence of ignorance of 
ecology that politicians will lift a finger to dial the ecologists and invite 
them to the table.  Too late. But it doesn't have to play out that way. 
If people can learn spiritual principles are more important even than ecology, 
then there is hope of avoiding catastrophe. I know it is a hard ask for a 
realist, even harder for a dumb-dumb materialist, but you've got to ask.

((At this point through reading 3BP, I am certainly worried (for my 
entertainment pleasure) that Liu Cixin might head towards blackpill 
nihilism. I hope that's not the case. Getting immersed into a story 
is a wonderful form of entertainment, but if the bubble is shattered it's 
kinda' depressing, which defeats the purpose.))

Interestingly, although I am not close friends with Warren Mosler, only a 
friendly acquaintance, I think he 
has a moral component to his work over the decades on what became MMT. He has 
always said he talks to anyone in power or schools or the general public who 
is listening, out of a sense of public duty and moral obligation. Few other 
economists teach from this motive. They teach from textbooks for a paycheck 
and academic career. They have no idea at least 25% of what they teach is 
nonsense, and in fact unethical. If you know this, what are you teaching for?

Never teach for a paycheck.

Expect a paycheck, but don't let that be the reason you teach. OK, I do not 
personally know a lot of economics teachers, I'm just guessing, but prove me 
wrong!  Can it be that they are not teaching economics for a pay check and 
yet refuse to inquire into the fundamental truths of the subject? 
What I do know is that Mosler at least does not do it for any income. He is 
pure. But, of course, considered a crank and heretic by mainstream economists, 
of all persuasions, post-keynesians, marxists, new Keynesians and 
neoclassical alike.  Warren Mosler is a Copernicus of our times. It is 
lucky Stephanie Kelton has not yet been burned at the metaphorical stake. 
You could say Steve Keen was the one burned at the stake, but like you'd 
expect for an Aussie, he survived the ordeal and only increased his cuss word 
frequency.


### Blackpill versus Pomo

About the pill colours. They come from the red-pill/blue-pill choice in 
*The Matrix*. I use "blackpill" almost synonymously with nihilism, though 
they are not the same.

From the [online Britannica encyclopedia](https://www.britannica.com/topic/red-pill-and-blue-pill#ref1318063):
> The manosphere generally refers to a vast network of websites and blogs 
frequented by online misogynist groups, including men’s rights activists 
(MRAs), pick-up artists (PUAs), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), and incels. 
Many of these groups consider taking the red pill as a key tenet of their 
journeys and a necessary jumping-off point for these various ideologies. In 
the manosphere, redpilling refers to embracing the idea that men’s unhappiness 
and lack of sexual success is the fault of women and feminists. Men who do not 
accept this reality are referred to as bluepilled.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red pill functions similarly in the 
so-called “manosphere.” The manosphere generally refers to a vast network of

“go ER”/be a “hERo,” referencing Elliot Rodger’s 2014 Isla Vista murder 
spree that has been called an act of misogynistic terrorism.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anarchist podcaster and writer Michael 
Malice has promoted the idea of the white pill, which expresses hope for a 
better political future. Less common references include the pink pill, 
purple pill, and green pill. In recent years the idea of “-pilling” has 
become a more mainstream online joke and a self-deprecating, ironic way to 
describe becoming interested in or influenced by something.Other colors of

Whoa! That's all nasty stuff. I felt the need to acknowledge this lexicon, 
because my more casual use of "blackpill" refers merely to 
*general hopelessness* and lack of hope for humanity generally, and my usage 
has nothing to do with misogyny. The point to "pilling" is that it is a 
conscious free willed *choice*. 

My other point is that if we sanely examine the evidence for and against 
humanity, there is no reason to become nihilistic. Humans do good things and 
bad things.  We do not have to solve the three body problem for redemption. 
We only need to treat each other with kindness and forgiveness, but the other 
side to Justice is to not allow people who wish to do harm to harm others. 
In other words, becoming a more spiritual person is a process, one that cannot 
be perfected, but which can be acquired in ever greater measure, and one 
measure is not to sit idly by while other people inflict needless harm upon 
others. But also, not to be a dick about this and go all fascist and 
over-protective of your ideals or children. Kindness and love cannot be imposed 
by external force. The greater force comes from within, and --- call me a 
wide-eyed optimist --- everyone has such capacity. We need to help each 
other exercise such inner force.

The thing is, this is easy to do. Patience and forbearance are arts for 
sure, but being able to roughly doodle in this form of art does wonders, you 
don't need to be a compassion and mercy Rembrandt to do a lot of good in the 
world.


### Spoiler 1

I was watching the Chinese TV series version parallel to reading the novels. 
In the TV series you see these little red ants from time to time, with 
heavy cinematic significance. 

Are the Trisolarans the red ant things? You know, I think they are. Or maybe 
not, a McGuffin?

Have to say of the TV adaptation, the world Central Command gang are freakin' 
bad actors. It is pretty hilarious. Oh yeah, Chinese State propaganda! 🤣 (I 
can believe it in this case.)

On this issue... I've watched plenty of action movies, superhero, Marvel, 
Batman, Superman, stuff in my life to to know "state propaganda" is pervasive 
and relative.

Half the time Hollywood probably does not know it is doing propaganda, It's 
like Noam Chomsky used to say, you do not have to believe you are a 
propagandists to be doing propaganda, more likely you're self-selected. Only 
natural born establishment shills get promoted to high rank in mainstream 
media.

Still, I kind of preferred the 1960's era depictions in *Three Body*.

Modern China is an incredible country, bustling with dynamism (and the 
pollution it comes with). It is super modern. But there is no excuse for 
shoddy acting when depicting the international governmental crowd, and what's 
with all the military regalia? 🤣 Hilarious stuff. Seriously dude, I honestly 
think it is for comic effect, could it not be?  I guess it might not be, so 
then it is even more hilarious. Spoils the scifi entertainment aspect 
though. Pity.

I'm not sure this can be made a critique of Liu Cixin's literary style, but 
in fact there are some plot points and dialogues (albeit in English 
translation) that seem pretty cringe. I skip over that speed-reading if 
I can. But much the same in *Dune* and *The Expanse* novels. You have to know 
when to speed read and when to slow down to enjoy sub-genius literature.

It's like in movies, suspension of disbelief. Only in literature I don't know 
the analogous phrase.  It should not be a thing, but in a lot of scifi 
literature it is, sadly. 

There is a lot of other funny stuff in the TV adaptation that makes it a bit 
too hilarious to get immersed not as serious scifi. Too many to bother 
mentioning, use of stock footage, a lot of characters stereotyped, and then 
the symbol of the ETO --- a clear upside down Freemason symbol. 
What's that about? The romantic cinematic scenes started to get a bit trite 
too, although I like the slowish pace they introduce. I'm only watching and 
reading along because I'm very depressed at the moment. Been a hard few 
weeks on top of a hard few months on top of a hard five years after five 
years of bitter-sweet bliss that got surgically removed from my heart with 
a thousand blunt chainsaws. 

### Technicomedies

The 2017 TV series is funnier than the books of course,... Chinese state 
propaganda! No, seriously. It is funny. I liked the way they depicted 
Ye Wenjie's discovery of radiation boundaries inside the Sun, these are 
regions where the frequencies of emission sharply drop, in-between boundaries 
the fall off in frequency is gradual, a power law presumably.

((There are in fact boundary layers in the Sun and stars, but I believe they 
are more like conventional magnetohydrodynamic boundaries. In 
*Three Body Problem* Liu Cixin has to invent a nice little fantasy physics 
into the story to get the million-fold magnification of microwave 
transmissions he needs. But it is a cool soft scifi plot device. *J'approuve*.))

The comedy angle is the TV series depicts Ye Wenjie's thesis as a stair case 
profile of frequencies. They should have used a power law fall off with 
boundary zones instead. Just for the *cool* factor.  But... ya know... the 
comedy is only for the learned.  Although it'd be a nice little sociological 
experiment to survey how many ordinary TV watchers realized the staircase 
profile was a bit fishy. School teachers take note! Try it on your students.

Come to think of it, this is the really serious good of shows like 
*Three Body*. They make some excellent school teaching resources for discussion. 

From bitter experience I've learned the "physics of scifi" lessons are not good 
in schools that have a national standards examination focus. But for younger 
and older kids (50 years +, or under 12 years) these fantasy resources make 
nice motivation for informal discussion and "college dorm room" banter.


## Suspended Judgment

There's little point ruining a fantasy scifi story with realist gripes. However, 
I can make an exception when you put characters and actors in entertainment 
jeopardy --- by which I mean painting them histrionically. It ruins the pure 
entertainment experience, at least for us hard scifi art snobs.  This is what 
Liu Cixin seemed to have to contrive.

Here is what I mean. Imagine the scenario of *begin confronted with outright 
miracles* was a thing, and was presented only to a few top scientists. What 
would be their response?  It would not be to commit suicide.  Did Liu Cixin 
really need to make the story about physicist suicides? It think that was 
unnecessary for the plot. Most physicists I know would be intrigued, and 
first would look to counsel one another to check not everyone was going 
insane.  Science just is not done in such isolation as portrayed in 
*Three Body Problem*.  And it did not have to be written that way.  The 
crisis could have been instead sheer confusion among the physicists.  It'd 
be far more natural that the physicists would get together. There is the 
Frontier of Science group in the story, who are a bit mystical --- and I 
think that will be integral to the plot later (probably aliens?).  But a 
more sedate and investigative world committee of physicists exploring the 
miracles would have been equally as compelling a story, more interesting, 
and more realistic.

((Note: the Netflix version might be different, I do not know.))

(((I do not yet know if the story is about alien First Contact. Just a third 
of the way in, but the Red Coast Base satellite must surely become a first 
contact instrument?)))


Liu Cixin did get it right mostly though, where it mattered, because he had 
the one anti-hero, Wang Miao, respond to the miracles realistically. That was 
incredibly important for me to stick with the book. Wang Miao realized the 
miracle of the *countdown* was subjective, and that means the laws of physics are 
not really vamoosed. It allowed the character to find empathy and friendship with 
the desultory and roughish, but ultimately loveable, detective Shi Qiang.

Yes, the response of a realistic community of physicists would in our real 
world been more like Wang Maio's response, but then i guess a few plot turns 
in *Three Body Problem* might not be "available".  Too bad I say. Eliminate 
them!  Make the story more believable. It would be a better work of art. As 
it stands, Remembrance of Earth's Past is probably a scifi classic, but not 
reaching the level of literary epic. I will probably still finish the trilogy.
Stay tuned then for more on the 3BP allegory.

The real gripe I have here is a very general critique of all literature and 
movies when it comes to heros. If you have a single character as the hero or 
anti-hero your story is, I am afraid to say, not realistic. But there is no 
need to write a novel this way, with a main central protagonist/heroine/hero.

The same trope ruined *The Expanse* --- although I loved those books too, to 
me, just subjectively, they were epic, although not great literature. 

Does Iain Banks write from a more humanistic perspective? Ursula LeGuin?  If 
they have I've not heard enough about their novels. (Hey, I can only spare 
the time to read about one scifi novel a year.)

<div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*</div>

I'm not deliberately making this article long, but depending upon how much 
grist there is to chew upon in *Remembrance of Earth's Past* it will be as 
long as that.

## Conformal Symmetry

I'd like to tell you something about the opening sequences for the Chinese TV 
adaptation. It depicts our solar system living within a larger cosmos, as if 
our entire universe was sitting inside the tip of a piece of carbon nanotube.
A similar concept is put to more comedic purposes in the 
[ending sequence of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kVUPZ8_UJ4) 
*[Men in Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kVUPZ8_UJ4)* if I recall.

The *bona fide* real physics concept here is called conformal or *scale* 
invariance. It is the idea that our laws of physics are not sensitive to the 
overall scale of things. So we could magnify everything up by a googol-fold 
and no one should notice the difference. It is an approximate symmetry in 
some areas of physics, notably electromagnetism and some string theory 
models.

It also is a symmetry that probably holds for time scales in our universe 
close to our so-called Big Bang. In fact, some cosmologists --- notably 
Neil Turok and Latham Boyle --- believe (and can show with their math) that a 
whole lot of particle physics makes a whole lot more sense if our universe had 
an exact conformal symmetry at the Big Bang. If it did, then there is little 
need to explain where the Big Bang came from, since the supposed singularity 
at our conformal time $\tau=0$ would not truly exist, it'd be a reflection 
symmetry boundary.  In a 4D Block universe conception of Nature this says 
that nothing came before the Big Bang, and the origin of our universe is 
then something more global. 

Whatever put us all here, put the whole 4D thing here, all at once, 
so-to-speak. Or at least implicitly, since nothing exists on the other side 
of a mirror. Nothing exists on the other side of our Big Bang. (Some people 
like to think there is an actual Mirror universe on the "other side" --- but 
a reflection reflects, it does not transmit. Just sayin'.)

If you prefer a cosmology where a universe does exist through a conformal 
symmetry boundary then Roger Penrose has a Conformal Cyclic Cosmology for 
you to work on, but it is by far the harder physics to get right, and is 
probably wrong.

There is however a hybrid of Turok--Boyle and Penrose, due to Anthony Lasenby 
and colleagues, which is that a far future conformal symmetry could possibly 
be "lived through" (for elementary particles, not biological life) but the 
universe on the other side would be time reflected with respect to ours. That's 
a wild one to wrap your head around, but "follow the math". It is not illogical 
nor inconceivable.

Since this is not my physics blog, I think I will leave this topic here. 
I cannot quite turn it to useful allegory.
 
 
## Redemptionists versus Adventists

**Spoilers:** ok, it is about alien first contact.

Oh no! No, no! The story got too stupid for me. The factions loyal to "Lord" 
(the advanced alien civilization) start doing the whole anti-religious 
thing (meaning pseudo-religious zealot ideological thing).  I thought I'd 
make it through to the end of *Three Body Problem*, but it has become too 
cringe.

However, there is something to be recovered in my allegory. It is true that 
in MMT circles there are factions. Some MMT advocates are capitalists, some 
socialist, and a mix in-between, I guess some might be quasi-libertarians, 
and there are plenty of liberals. However, I do not see *Three Body Problem* 
being of more use for my allegory. Using scifi as allegory was a nice game 
worth paying while it lasted today.

I still do not think the book is Chinese State propaganda, but the TV series 
has enough weird actors playing the international community (they appear to be 
amateur actors) that it sort of ruins the feel of the TV series. The 
cinematography is good for a TV/streaming budget, but I got a bit tired 
sucking in the cringe on many aspects of the production, eventually. 

I am guessing the Netflix version will be cringe in another way, the way 
*Game of Thrones* became. But I'll have a look at it next year maybe, just in 
case they do something different with the whole aliens as "Lord" plot. Change 
that up into something realistic and more hard scifi and it could be very good 
entertainment. 

### Conflict Theory

OK, I'm being too sensitive. For sure, history teaches us humans tend to get 
into ideological conflict when there is uncertainty. So it is not at all 
unrealistic that the ETO in *Three Body* would splinter into factions. This 
fits with plenty of allegories, as I just mentioned.  I will suck-it-up then 
and continue reading. (Later on I will get to the spoiler where Cixin Liu 
paints the Trisolarians motives for wanting to invade the Earth, but I have 
not read up to it yet in the book.)

However, I do like my scifi more when the super-powerful aliens are ethical. 
Why would they not be?

The worst dis-analogy people have about this is getting reflected in 
contemporary society in the form of the fear of Ai superintelligence. The idea 
is supertintelligent Ai might treat the human species as ants. This is 
laughable. It is an idea based on a false analogy. (The analogy is how humans 
treat actual ants.)

There are many flaws in the analogy, but the biggest is that a 
superintelligence will conform to *our* pretend analogies!  Another is the 
idea hierarchies of intelligence will recapitulate (a fractal sociology 
notion). There is no justification for this thesis.

In fact, I am pretty cynical about the Ai tech industry. I think they are 
capable, even innocently, of drumming up fear of an Ai singularity just to 
fuel their research. I call it Nerd Capitalism.

But heck, better to fund the nerds than the Military, I say. Although, you'd 
like to fund the Einstein's not the Oppenheimer's and Teller's'. Not all nerds 
were compiled equal.

The thing about Nick Bostrom, Connor whatshisname, whatshisname Yudkowsky, 
and whatshisname Hinton --- all the Ai Singularity fear-mongers --- is that 
their inferences are bogus. But why? Can I prove they are wrong?

No, I cannot prove they are wrong. We just cannot well-predict the future. 
The problem here is one of probability theory. The Ai nerds want you to 
believe their doom prognostications are 95% confident bands, or whatever.

The truth is, they have no idea what the error bands are for their doom 
predictions and nightmare scenarios. No one does.

If pressed on this, some of them will say, "Yeah, but prepare for the worst."

OK.

What is the worst case scenario though?

Once again, they have no idea. They have worst case nightmares and dreams, 
but so do I, and mine are not the same as theirs. Who is to say whose 
nightmares are more realistic?

Our biggest closest threat coming from Ai is the powerful and wealthy people 
seeking to monopolize the technology, not the robots themselves.

What's more, all the false psychology in macroeconomics --- it is equally a 
threat to human well-being. Robot automation does not take away worker wages. 
They take away shit jobs. Any useful work an Ai bot can do is by definition a 
shit job.  This does not mean quality control and oversight of the Ai 
systems --- for those are shit jobs that must always be a human worker's 
burden. Those people need decent wages, but even more importantly such workers 
need good healthcare. The Ai system has to have such costs factored in, and if 
that makes them unprofitable it is then up to government to worry about whether 
the Ai service is socially necessary and therefore needs to be subsidized 
or nationalized. 
Primarily the question for Ai automation is: is it actually reducing human 
labour burdens and overall increasing human well-being? Such questions can be 
hard to answer, and we might get them wrong sometimes, but they are not 
impossible to estimate and we have to do so.

Every shit job removed from a human worker's daily 
burden, without introducing more shit jobs or pollution elsewhere, is a win 
for humanity. 
Only the MMT aware know this means *more* cash for worker 
wages is affordable without inflation risk. Why? Because we aught to be 
commissioning the Ai robots to produce real output for human and other 
planetary needs. That means all humans can work fewer hours producing *that* 
output. But this also means people can work for higher wages doing more 
interesting things. Like producing awesome scifi novels, or curing cancer.

The interesting thing is, if we were all content to live humbly, we would 
have zero need for Ai. Humanity survived for centuries without the robots. 
But if we collectively desire ever higher standards of living, and the 
necessary healthcare support is going to consume vast resources, then we 
will probably need a lot more automation.

My claim would be what we fundamentally have to deal with politically and 
globally is an ethical macroeconomics, a spiritual economics, and a fair go 
for all people. It has nothing to do with Ai. Ai can be used as a tool to 
emancipate the working class, but it is only a tool. This means dismantling 
old power structures and replacing them with power and authority that serves 
the interests of the poorest. For the poor did not get a vote in determining 
their condition.


### Spoiler: The Trisolarian need for invasion

Gawd, it was bit disappointing. The Trisolarian militarists are scared of 
humans. They realize human science advances at a faster pace than 
Trisolarian. OK. It is a good enough plot device. 

They also have not figured out Magneto brain helmets to shield their thoughts.
(we will assume humans could figure out how to HUD display a Trisolarian's 
brain beamed thought. LOL.)

I dunno though. I am going cold on the whole trilogy. Why do the Aliens always 
need to be a threat?  It's xenophobic. It is also disgusting, given actual 
border humanitarian crises on our actual Earth. The heart yearns for a cool 
scifi novel without xenophobia as the default contact reaction.

*The Expanse* was such a cool series. Placing the human conflict where it 
truly is for real. It's class conflict, it always has been. Racism is a 
fairly new human invention, and some say (though I am no expert on this) a 
lot of racism was invented to fuel capitalism. (Liberal meaning of the word 
"capitalism" --- includes slavery of all forms, including tying pencil 
pushers and paper shufflers to desks, even when they're not complaining 
about it. Look-up *Bullsh$\ast$t Jobs*.) 

### Nihilism

I do "get" the strong theme of nihilism in *Three Body*. Humans suck.

But it is a prejudice of our times. It is a jaundiced view of humanity that 
originates from looking only at the evil people do, and ignoring all the good. 
To be wise one needs to weight such extremes.  Although I'm no anthropologist, 
I would suspect if we weight the acts people do, and have done, overall the 
human species is truly marvellous and wonderful. 

It is however a fair enough plot device to use. Because a few cynics can 
certainly spoil things for millions. I'll thus be interested in reading on 
to see where Liu Cixin takes this. But it could get boring, and tell us more 
about Liu Cixin's blinkered view of humanity than about what he could have
learned from life and reflected in his scifi art.

### Redemptionists

(Or, anti-puniness.)

Man oh man! The Redemptionists in the story get a terrible treatment. Avoiding 
spoilers, here I want to comment on the bit of modern fable that Liu Cixin 
draws upon for his plot. It is the idea that humans are puny, insignificant 
and un-special.

I actually find this laughable. But understandable. And so also a crux.
I'll try to explain.

Firstly the capacity we have to see ourselves as either special or 
insignificant is pretty significant. It's not a paradox, since the "out" is 
clearly that we are special. Any creature that gains sentient subjective 
consciousness knows it is special, and it is ignorance of physics to fail to 
see this. People who think humans are just highly evolved apes are 
missing... everything... or shall I be fair and say they are missing 
nearly everything.

Secondly, I take the Copernican Principle seriously: this is the idea that 
it's not a good idea to think you are the centre of the universe. Clearly 
humans are not centres of the universe. However, this does not logically lead 
to the conclusion we are insignificant. It just means we are not the centre. 
Of course "centre" here means the "be all and end all" as well as the 
scientific notion that the cosmos does not have a privileged status for any 
one observer or plant.  It is a key principle of modern science. As I 
explained before, it's about symmetry principles and invariants, these are 
what define physics.

But again, this refutes the nihilist thesis, because the very fact human 
civilization has proven capable of discovering the principles of physics 
(and so much more at higher levels of organization) implies again, we are 
highly significant creatures. Don't write us off you mad Adventists!

I don't want to write an essay on this, so I'll mention just a third and fourth 
point for now (I can think of many more).  The third is the simplistic idea 
the universe is so damn vast, and the Earth is so damn small, so we literally 
are insignificant.  This is the most laughable. It does not even bare a 
mention, but I feel I must mention it for some weaker minds.  The point is, 
ruler and clock scale is not a great metric for "significance".

There is no telling what human civilization will become capable of, and so 
concluding right now that we are puny and insignificant is pretty insane.

Lastly, the fourth: you should consider that humans on Earth might 
in fact advance in future to something like the fictional Trisolarian 
technical advancement. We'd be the "Lords" perhaps to some other "backwards" 
planetary civilization. This despite not having the harshness of Trisolaris 
to cut our technological teeth upon --- and that's a fantastical plot device 
to be sure --- ultracapitalism or ultradarwinism! 🤣) 

There is more to say on this fourth principle of non-significance. It 
has relevance to current debates about Ai Singularity. The idea is we'd better 
be careful in developing Ai because it might over-run us and treat humans like 
we treat ants. This is laughable. It is a false inference and a terribly 
childish dis-analogy. For one thing, humans do not have to go around treading 
on ants and digging up insects with no concern or compassion. We mess with the 
Earth knowing the insects are *likely* not conscious. Whereas a hypothetical 
Trisolarian civilization would damn well for sure know humans were sentient. 
Would you believe an advanced alien race would treat humans like ants? No! 
They'd treat us like... humans. What that means is impossible for us to say, 
because we have nothing relevant to infer from, except how we treat each other.

Again, how we treat each other could be a cause for a touch of nihilism, 
but... hardly! I've never been  treated anything but kindly to indifferent 
by every person on Earth I have ever met. The sockcuckers were all hiding 
online. Actually, I was a victim of crime, a couple of times, but I did not 
know it at the time. OK, case closed I guess, all humans suck and are 
irredeemable! 'cos', ya know... if one person can be criminal, well hell 
Cleetus, we all are capable dognabit. 🤣 Send us all to hell Cleetus, be 
quick about it thanks.

((I know, it's only a story, by so disappointing the gentle scientist 
Ye Wenjie goes all Cleetus' Dad on all of humanity. Faaarrrk.))

Continuing ignoring it is only a story...

The idea humans are to ants as Trisolarians are to humans is a false analogy. 
It applies only in some intellectual sense, not in a spiritual sense. Certainly 
not in a political or colonialist/imperialist sense. Ants do not have any 
politics, and have no companions they love and are willing to die for, they 
just die for their colony by instinct. Their sociology is also blind and 
instinctual, and we talk about "ant society" by imposing our language on 
the situation, but it is a very different category to human society. Any 
analogies here are highly fraught with ample scope for error and stupid 
reasoning (lobster hierarchy!). This topic is probably worth an essay for 
idiot philosophers, if I had nothing better to do, but I do, so no essay.

Why is this making *Three Body Problem* a sucky story? It is because even 
though it is only a story, the authorial "god" for a good scifi story 
cannot use false analogies. *Characters can*. Authors not.

Oh damn... I cannot resist a fifth: another source of nihilism and feelings 
of insignificance is the individualistic mindset. Sure my friend, *You* might 
be insignificant, but human civilization need not be so. But I would go 
further. But only because I have a few other metaphysical suspensions (did I 
mean to write "suspicions"?). I am one of those who think consciousness 
indicates we are not physical creatures. But we live in a physical world. 
If you can put those two thoughts together in a constructive way then you 
will get the idea, I won't need to elaborate. In any case, it is the most 
powerful sort of evidence that we are not insignificant puny creatures, but 
rather in some sense the cosmos was made for us (and any other sentient 
civilizations). Being dropped into such a vast cosmos is of course humbling, 
but I think that is entirely part of the point of it!  If only you can 
understand!

Puniness is contextual.

You hopefully can see where I am going with my macroeconomics and political 
economy allegory!

We cannot say the past understanding of neoclassical macroeconomics means 
doom for socialism or a decent society. We would need to know what an advanced 
level of political comprehension will do for humanity, and you never know, 
in 15 or 20 years we might be doing wonders. Or maybe it'll take great 
catastrophe, so a century or more outlook. In any case, we today cannot 
comprehend how political economy will evolve, and there is thus no cause for 
doom and gloom.  There is incredible cause for fear and regret, but not for 
doom and gloom.  In fact does it not imply the eternal optimist is the 
preferred stance? The wiser stance?  I think so.

Doom and gloom are in fact neoclassical attitudes themselves. Stuck-in-a-rut 
attitudes. No capacity to think dynamically. There is a big irony there, 
since aren't neoclassicals the big boosters of the dynamo of capitalism?'

Listen you guys, a dynamo that can only swirl about an equilibrium is no 
creative thing.  You shouldn't want neoclassical economics even if it were 
true.


### Authorial Insertion

About two-third the way through the first book. I find myself caring about 
the author now, which is a bad sign for enjoying the story. I don't want the 
story going down the paternal Alien overlord route. Not only is it sucky 
scifi, it starts to seem like betraying the author's motives.

**Spoiler:**  
It is quite an audacious piece of writing to have the main character, 
Ye Wenjie, push a button on the microwave transmitter to send a message 
of "Come please rule over us!" just after reading the first ever alien 
contact message: "Please do not communicate! I'm a pacifist among my people 
and we will invade you. Please do not communicate!"

Cixin tries to motivate this via an alienation among humans, and the 
loneliness of Ye Wenjie. But I find that character sketch unbelievable. A real 
life Ye Wenjie would probably not betray the entire human race like that!
The plot seems far more symptomatic of Liu Cixin's pessimism than of a good 
well written story. I know I'm only reading a translation... but still!!

Also... I *know* it is pointless critiquing fiction, ... but I can't help 
myself. Call it post Twitter withdrawal syndrome. (Yeah, I gave up that 
gaping hole of enshittification.)

Let me emphasize, it is not a bad scifi fantasy to read, it gives me this 
grist to write! I just wish it were not so cringe.

I'll tell you one of the arts of genius writing: you don't need a terrific 
vocabulary nor amazing descriptive prowess, but you do need sympathy for your 
reader. (Unless you are James Joyce --- genius by an entirely other means, 
such a galaxy brained genius I can't get through one of his books, I'd 
rather spend time reading mathematical physics. 🤣)



### The Crud of Advanced Aliens

It's the same trouble with superheros. If you do not build-in flaws and 
fallibility, then your advanced alien species that regards humans as puny 
insects is an unbelievable story. Lower than soft scifi, it becomes just 
fantasy novel. I have no time for reading fantasy novels. But I also have 
no time to write this blog post either. Amazing what you can do stealing 
time spaghetti.

The Trisolarians have no need to invade the Earth. They'd be a spiritual 
species. To write the story as if they want to wipe out humanity because to 
them we are insects is thoroughly unbelievable, and it seriously gives me the 
urge to quit reading the book. It's Liu Cixin now who needs to redeem himself.
I hate it when books turn this way onto the author's view. But in this case, 
it is so bad, 'cos I *wanted* it to be harder scifi, so what am I gonna do? 
(I know, I know, I should not *want* so much.)

Such superpower stories lean on the fallacy I mentioned previously: namely 
that social hierarchy scales to sentient species hierarchy.
 
Wrong!  So badly wrong. It cannot scale. 

Once a civilization is at a human level of advancement, it is capable of 
regarding and recognizing other intelligent species as worthy of giving care. 
It is not even that it is irrational not to assume a higher 
species would recognize a lesser sentient species, but that the spiritual 
faculty we know we all have would be somehow less advanced in the powerful 
alien species?  Why would that be so? The far more realistic case would be 
the opposite. They'd be more peaceful and spiritual than us, not less, and by 
a long way.

Pre-22nd Century Scifi writers are not "getting" this. I mean, the whole 
dystopian thing and space war thing is a terrible prejudice of our times. 
*Star Wars* is literally children's entertainment fodder. Yeah, I loved 
*Star Wars* as a kid, it was our generation's *The Matrix*. But a grown-up can 
be a little more mature and learn to respect more serious scifi space opera, 
which is incredibly rare, and so all the more delicious when found. 

Even the *Red Mars* series by Kim Stanley Robinson was a bit too militaristic 
for my taste. OK, it was clearly allegory and *cautionary tale* but it still 
could have been more spiritual. To write of the future in a spiritual way is 
tough, I "get" that! But I wish more scifi authors would try.

It is a greater art to write tension and intrigue without prepubescent man-baby 
militarism. But let's face it, humanity *is* at an adolescent stage in history, 
so most people cannot see what the adult futuristic scifi could be. If I wrote 
the novel of this kind it would likely flop (I mean even if I was a genius 
writer). Maybe Ursula LeGuin wrote a few of the kind I would admire, but so 
far I've only read a couple of her books, and they seemed to me to have a bit 
of a "humans are stupid" and "war is inevitable" vibe to them too. 🤣


## Two Proton Theory

**Spoiler:**  
The fun stuff blogging about scifi in real-time. How are the Trisolarians 
using two protons to "shut down human science"? I am guessing it'll be 
entanglement, so quantum teleportation. It's soft scifi because you cannot 
exploit teleportation without first going to the other end of your entangled 
system at conventional sub-luminal speed. I guess the 6/7-dimensional string 
theory space, the Calabi-Yau manifold, will come into play too, but I cannot 
see how that swings the plot to permit a disruption of human science over 
400 years! 

Trouble is, for a physicist, this is enough of a carrot to keep you reading a 
bad novel.


**Spoilers:**  
OK, I read through to where the *sophons* are explained. 
Superstring theory it is! 🤣  Protons being "unfolded" so that one of the 
6 Calabi-Yau compactified dimensions becomes macroscopic. It was disappointing 
that this plot device was used to then etch computer logic arrays onto the 
enlarged dimension, turning the single proton into a supercomputer. Once a
Calibi-Yau dimension is enlarged there is nothing but vacuum to "write" or 
"etch" upon. If you engineer some other actual membrane to write information 
on then it will no longer be a proton, by definition. In particular it could 
not then be recompressed back down to small superstring dimensions. Besides 
which, the proton is not a compactified object, it is a composite of strings 
(three constantly mixing quarks and an ephemeral sea of gluons --- these far 
more unstable critters are all you could  "unpack" into large extra 
dimensions). So this was highly cringe for a reading physicist wanting some 
decent entertainment. 

There have to be dozens of better ways to scifi imagine a stealth 
supercomputer carrying an Ai program as a weapon against Earth. I would 
probably go for nanobots that can assemble to mimic a natural biological 
species, like an ant. The processing could be done partly remote, using 
entangled Bell pairs, and all the ant would need to do would be to receive 
radio signals for the quantum teleportation decoding. (A quantum teleport is 
not possible at faster-than-light speed. The receiver needs to be sent an 
instruction via normal space channels.) Having such realistic constraints is 
good for a scifi writer.

Though, I admit, to the fantacists these would be nowhere near as "cool" as 
Liu Cixin's sophons. The sophon is an incredibly scary scifi invention, one 
of my favourite horrors now (if we are talking pure fantasy, 
I can appreciate good fantasy, I just do not like it inserted into scifi).

I am not so sure about the Trisolarians having brains that emit 
electromagnetic waves that betray all their thoughts, so they cannot lie or 
deceive. That one came as a shock. I am sure Liu Cixin thought he needs it 
for novelty or some plot turn, but again, it is too big a stretch for scifi.
Why not stick a Magneto (Erik Lehnsherr) helmet on to shield your thinking?
You cannot write serious scifi and tell me no Trisolarian would think of 
this. Nor that their evolution would not have had to go through a period where 
their brains were not so luminous. As I said, cringe.

Worrisome, since as goes the scifi cringe, so probably goes the sociology and 
political cringe. I cannot see the second novel, *The Dark Forest* going well 
for a reader like myself.

However, I did like the way detective Shi Qiang ended the first novel (not the 
horrific nano flying knife slicing of the oil tanker, but the "bugs" bit). 
Some hope for the optimistic reader, reading scifi for imagination and 
creative reflection upon our future, amidst too much stupid nihilism. 

It was interesting Cixin wrote the character Ye Wenjie as one who thought 
advanced aliens would almost surely have to be spiritual (kind, compassionate, 
peaceful). In the afterword it seems clear Liu Cixin himself thinks the 
opposite, so he has a terrible sense of social consciousness I feel. 
What a dick. (Hey... my informed opinion is all!) He should not have written 
the afterword, it ruined the whole reading experience. The author 
sometimes needs to stfu. Same problem with Frank Herbert. A good example of 
an author who stays quiet better would be William Gibson. I don't quite 
know why, but for me, subjectively, it should be the same problem for 
Ursula LeGuin, but I don't *always* get the same cringe from her books. 
I'm not saying authors cannot have afterwords for their novels, I am just 
saying I was unfortunate to bother reading this one. However, it is not all 
bad, Liu Cixin seems to be sympathetic to environmentalism and greater unity 
among the people of the Earth. His atrocious political beliefs are concerning 
non-existent aliens.  Not that I think extraterrestrials do not exist, I think 
they do, but it is childish to believe in the Mathers theory (the fictional 
RAND author character) that they'd be hostile or would be a source of conflict 
among humans simply by the symbolic event of a First Contact, or monopolization 
of knowledge potentially gained from an advanced alien species. 

(Kind of makes you hope the other guys had Star Trek and the 
Prime Directive.) 

There is a more balanced view of CETI (communication with extraterrestiral intelligence) in a Cold War context you can get here: 
[“Mixed Signals Communication with the Alien in Cold War Radio Astronomy”](https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/7e186d38-914c-4175-bd0c-d9501279dd98/content) by Rebecca Charbonneau. She actually discusses 
*Three Body Problem*. I did not read it all, since it is irrelevant now the 
Cold War is over,  her thesis mostly concerned historical analysis of the 
Cold War politics, not future ET contact.

I suspect some of the fictional BIll Mather theory might be applicable 
should ET contact just one person or nation tomorrow. (Why would they?)

OK, Liu Cixin portrays a scenario why they might! That's the fun of the 
scifi.

((Also, who knows, maybe Liu Cixin *was* influenced by some RAND lunatic. A lot 
of stuff that came out of RAND was laughable Neocon foolery, 
unfortunately cloaked in a lot of serious intent and taken seriously by 
the neoliberals and, it seems, by Liu Cixin. RAND also had plenty of 
intellectual firepower to lend the air of distinguished scholarship. A lot of 
what came out of RAND was also very good analysis. But if you are a reader 
of RAND reports, and a user, it is your duty to conduct due diligence and weed 
out the wheat from the chaff.))

Fans of Liu Cixin should not be upset and flame me, these are just my 
personal opinions, so don't hate me for them. I am not saying he wrote 
[Chinese State propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI) 
material! 🤣


## Critical Non-criticism

I have repeatedly stated, at least four times now I think, that I am not 
really interested in too much literary criticism. The story is what it is. 
In fact if I came across a blog like this without the context I would also 
be pretty disgusted with myself --- it is not my place to criticize 
Liu Cixin's story-telling.

As I said, I merely found the need to read a novel to get over a bout of 
depression, and since *The Three Body Problem* became incredibly annoying I 
felt I had to release some frustrations. I have tried the next best thing, 
which is to use 3BP as an allegory for my macroeconomic justice activism. 
And a chance to indulge in a bit of sociological futurology. I think I 
might continue as I go through the 2nd and 3rd books of the trilogy, as my 
the mood takes me.

Also I will admit, this blog post is not for my readers, it is just for me.
If you are enjoying it so far, that's a bonus. I had finished the first novel 
by the end of the next section, and have decided to keep reading the 2nd, but 
will not promise more commentary. There is a slim chance the trilogy will 
become more hopeful, by which I mean more realistic. This probably runs 
counter to the cultural milieu in contemporary society, where climate 
change and pollution and endless wars have become a source of deep cynicism 
and nihilism. "Don't bring a baby into this world!"' But I simply don't 
share such hopelessness. If for no other reason than hopelessness does our 
more optimistic scenario chances no good. Also, my particular babies, now 
young adults, are going to do a lot more good for our society than I ever 
can.

## Preliminary --- 90% through

I think *The Expanse* is the 2020's best scifi on the small screen so far.

I often stray in my thoughts to think about why, and it was not because it 
was militaristic, nor great literature. The answer, for me, is that 
*The Expanse* had the heroes and heroine's, and collective insanity 
(the Martian faction) but overall it portrayed humans as decent, united when 
they realized they needed to be, including most Martians, and it this was 
good. But also it was a detective story which stayed true to the genre to 
the end. *SciFi* was essentially (or at least subjectively to me) *the* 
McGuffin of *The Expanse*. The greatest McGuffin I've ever witnessed so far.

I tolerated a few others, there was a Starz series, 
[“Counterpart”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)) based 
around a parallel world tunnel, and the German production [“Dark”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)) with a nuclear power station mishap 
turned time travel portal (a German series based around a fictional town of 
Winden). They were watchable. Today I am having more fun writing this article 
than reading the novel, so another 
<font style="color: tomato" >red flag</font>.

In my old age I've learned to dismiss time travel stories, they don't work 
for me, unless used for comedy. Parallel Worlds are no good either, but 
that's a bias I have from my own physics research preferences. So if anyone 
thinks there is scifi entertainment better than *The Expanse* please tell me.
The good stuff is good for me when I am low and depressed.

I will probably persist with *Remembrance of Earth's Past*, but now I think 
it's going to be more a chore than for entertainment. (Curiosity can do that, 
kills the catch).

## Yang Dong

I did make it to the end of *Three Body*. Damn.

**Spoilers:** diabolical is not even the harshest word. What happened to 
Yang Dong was a piece of scifi writing to be sure, that I'd never really 
read before. I will relate the story in case you do not like reading epic 
tragedy.

So Ye Wenjie contacts aliens using the Sun as a million-fold amplifier, and 
asks them to invade the Earth. Her motive is to unifying humanity. 
(She may yet get her wish, since humans can unify all right, in the face of a 
common enemy.)  She recognizes she "betrayed" all humankind. 

Worse to come. Mike Evans, an eco-extremist, co-opts Ye Wenjie's ideals and 
monopolizes contact with the Trisolarians. He plans to destroy the human 
species, entirely, no jokes, totally serious. His Adventist faction of the 
ETO has this as their explicit goal. Ye Wenjie has Redemptionist sympathy, 
those who worship the Trisolarians as potential benevolent overlords. (A whole
kettle of fishy fish I won't get into, but you probably know my views by now.)

The Trisolarians can only send radio message or a couple of protons to Earth, 
they do so, takes only a 40 years. The protons arrive by around 2020.
They have been crafted to store an advanced AI, using unfolded Calabi-Yau 
manifold dimensions. Trekkies would call this "subspace". They cannot unfold 
near Earth because they could be nuked. But they can alter microscopic events, 
and they proceed to mes up fundamental physics experiments, like the LHC stuff 
and quantum computers. The purpose is to freeze human scientific knowledge, 
so human cannot ever understand the subspace physics.  This will ensure when the 
Trisolaran space fleet arrives in about 400 years, human technology will still 
be relatively primitive.

Plot future? This should not freeze applied physics, so the nanotech 
developed by the character Wang Maio will be a key thing in any defeat of 
Trisolaris invasion, one presumes, or part of a defeat. It is shaping up 
as David vs Goliath. Or Guerilla war more precisely. (War of the Worlds a 
bit too, but with humans the bugs.) Did I mention the Trisolarians are really 
friggin mean, nasty and paranoid! But you might be too if your planet was 
going to dive into your Sun.

The Trisolarians have learned (from Evans) that human science advances rapidly, 
so would overtake the Trisolarians in that time span.

Have not got to the kicker yet!

Ye Wenjie's daughter, Yang Dong, becomes a theoretical physicist working on 
String Theory, and doing experimental investigations. This would be a major 
area of science humans would defeat the Trisolarans with (we presume --- in 
our real world... nah!).

She becomes a target of the AI sophons (the sentient protons). They mess up 
her experiments. She concludes, "Physics does not exist." And nihilistically 
gives up science. Except not so nihilistically. She retires form science and 
starts to enjoy nature, living without watching new media and doing peaceful 
things with her husband. 

Trouble is, she logs onto her computer and comes across an old file saved by 
her mother, which details Ye Wenjie's plans to allow the Trisolarians to 
invade the Earth. She recognizes the betrayal of her mother. Not only against 
all humankind, whatever her "good" motives, but also against her own daughter. 
It is due to the Trisolarians that she could not pursue her first love, 
theoretical physics. 

We learn that her suicide note had deeper meaning. She wrote, 
> "Physics does not exist, and *never will exist*.

She realized the Trisolarians were going to destroy humanity, and stopping 
physics progress was their first strike method. This is what sent Yang Dong 
into the deeper depression --- that her mother was responsible (at least for 
lighting a fire she could not control) was the last fatal straw. She was 
resigned to physics not existing at the Planck scale, but to now learn that was 
only because of the Trisolarian attack, instigated by her mother,...

... well... maybe most people cannot appreciate the depravity of it, but 
any scientist could empathize with Yang Dong. She was the first human 
outside the ETO factions who realized the despair and utter hopelessness of 
the situation for future humankind.

So... whoa!

I am not sure if this was magnificent scfi-fantasy story-telling, or 
completely depraved by Liu Cixin? The physics module in my brain says 
"depraved".


# The Dark Forest 

## Wallfacers

The 2nd novel, *The Dark Forest* hints at some incipient human fight-back, 
using a plot device of a *Wallfacer*. These are chosen humans, just a 
hand-full, who will be given unparalleled resource access do do whatever the 
hell they want, with minimalist UN oversight. Their only brief is they cannot 
communicate with anyone what their strategy is, since the sophons can see and 
hear and read all. The sophons however cannot read human thought.

Thought-based warfare basically.

The term "Wallfacer" comes from meditation against a blank wall. 

Trouble is, only one of the Wallfacers, Luo Ji, seems to know they're not 
supposed to blab or reveal their plans. 

(Major plot failure here, since they were all sternly briefed on the entire 
modus operandi of the Wallfacers, which was to make sure no one has an 
inkling of what they are up to. You might think the "Let's nuke 'em!" pair 
are bluffing? But then, what a waste of resource (they are each commissioning 
ultra-fission bombs, small stars. The sophons can halt nuclear reactions 
bros.)

But young Luo Ji,  he's taking it easy, giving up, black-pilling, 
choosing instead to craft the perfect woman lover and live a Bohemian 
lifestyle in a paradise. (His is the cheapest Wallfacer strategy so far.) 

Or is he?

Hence some mystery and intrigue, just enough to keep me reading. No longer 
for the sci of the scifi, but for the mystery novel aspect. The character
Luo Ji seems like a real dick, but you have to think his strategy is to look 
like a dick.

All the other Wallfacers have a nemesis in the ETO, a *Wallbreaker*, who is 
there own personal assassin (or disruptor, whichever I guess works.) 
If nothing else, this is a novel scifi device I think. So, semi-cool I guess.

### Continued Militarism

It is clear Lui Cixin has a pretty warped view of humanity, or at least has 
chosen that for his portrayals. Too much aggression and militarism. So he 
gets a lot in Tom Clancy sort of writing, the Generals are dominant, the 
Civilian leadership muted --- except for UN Sec.Gen Ms Say. (Does the author 
give her a first name?)

While the Wallfacers and Wallbreakers are terrific new (I think) scifi 
plot devices, I found them to degenerate into comedy. In this context 
"comedy" means too cartoonish to be hard scifi respectable. While fantasy 
scifi does not have to be *hard*, the literature is superior when it is 
*hard* when it is not necessary to be *soft*."

All such literary critique should be taken in stride. I cannot write a 
single novel, I'm too lazy, and if I did, because I am lazy, it'd probably 
read even more cartoonish. But I will not stfu. As I noted before, I am 
writing this mediation on Three Body Problem for my own depression 
alleviation. Why are you still reading this?
