Change of pace from recent posts today. I revert like a child to hard scifi 
when depressed and unable to focus. 
[Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))
was recommended, but sadly it turned out to be very soft scifi. Still... it 
did the job.  However, it did a little more. Since the Netflix version of the 
novels is now screening, it has entered mainstream pop culture, so that's an opportunity for an MMT activist, physicist and philosopher to draw some 
major fodder from for writing for popular consumption.

Geeky stuff out of the way first?

## Chaos Theory

The relevance of the 3-body problem to macroeconomics is palpable. 
Henri Poincare was one of the first to see classical dynamics is next to 
insoluble, when he showed that the solar system is unstable and the general 
solution to even three gravitating bodies in motion is chaotic. Technically 
that means any numerical attempt at a solution will very soon wildly diverge 
in prediction from reality.

In the 1960's the meteorologist Edward Lorenz showed the same for a very simple 
model of "weather" (fluid convection). Eventually some heterodox economists 
caught on to this, and realized economic systems were far from equilibrium, 
and inherently chaotic. The folks at the Sante Fe Institute were leader in 
such thought, and later John Blatt and Steve Keen made their valuable 
contributions. Amazingly, and sadly, mainstream economics never caught on and 
has remained in the dark ages of equilibrium modelling.  This is due to the 
whole ideological indoctrination that "perfect markets" thinking does for you. 
You think prices would be stable and sales will clear, if only 
government took its sticky finger off the free market. LOL. ðŸ¤£

((Why would you even think an economy has to be solvable? Maybe you are a 
little neoclassical baby?))

But that's not my topic for today. If you think idealized toy models that are 
solvable can tell you anything useful about the real world economy, then good 
luck to you. But for the love of God please stay clear of any policy 
round-tables you crank.

### Instability versus Unpredictability

One thing which confuses weak minded economists, I suspect, is that they look 
at empirical data (I suppose) and see cycles and periods of stability with no 
hyperinflation. There is then a natural childish tendency I can sympathize${}^\ast$ 
with in swishing to model the economic system in equilibrium terms, because 
after all, things seem to swirl around some sort of stable relative price 
vector, after accounting for nominal price adjustments (just looking at 
relative prices).

Sadly this is delusional.

${}^\ast$In theoretical physics and computer programming I do seek simplicity, 
like a grown-up child. The thing about being a child at heart is that although 
it can be a wonderful thing, you really aught to also know when that is not 
appropriate.

The periodic motions of the economy are not stable orbit about an ideal 
equilibrium. They are quasi-periodic motions far-from-equilibrium. But this 
does not mean the economy is unstable. It means it is unpredictable. There is 
a big difference.


## Remembrance of Earth's Past

Whoa! Cixin Liu is no Proust. Although, to be fair, Proust is a little 
over-rated. I loved _Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu_ when I was a teenager, but 
when I matured I better understood why the Monte Python skit is even funnier 
than it first appears.  The Proustian romance and pathos is one thing, but 
you really can't appreciate it until you've lived a good life and have 
experienced true loss of love and loss of innocence. I sometimes wonder what 
my life would be like if I had been sparred all the heartache and sorrow? 
Probably would have been superficially nicer, but probably not as meaningful.

Anyhow, I guess I will have some thing to say about the politics of hard 
scifi, and will use the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy as a case 
study, since... why not?  *Game of Thrones* is over-cooked by now.

For scifi fans, I'd recommend the EPUB books, you can get them free-libre, or 
look for the Chinese TV series. Reading subtitles is not the worst thing in 
the world, my daughters who have Smartphone addiction and extremely normal 
average "ADHD" (the type every kid has these days, total normality) watch a 
lot of Korean sitcom and romcom drama.

### The Premise

I'll be writing as I read the novels. Thus without foreknowledge of the plot 
twists.

I have to say, I did read a little about Liu Cixin, and the opinions about 
his politics.  To summarize, he's a little bit apolitical, but has this weird 
view that authoritarianism is the natural end state of human civilization... 
I think, if I read the reports correctly. I could be wrong. This has 
[offended some scifi fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZW1xnkzkI). 
It is propaganda?  Whoa!

But like Vladimir Nabokov was a dick, I wouldn't put an author's political 
opinions in the way of a good read. For me, I can easily filter out political 
propaganda, and will often laugh at it, but the merits of the scifi story as 
entertainment could still be considerable. Anyone remember *The Matrix*?

I will confess then that I liked the premise of *Remembrance of Earth's Past*. 
The one-liner "Physics does not exist, and never will exist" is pretty good.
Why? It is because you should have researched the author, and know he is a 
computer engineer. Thus you know damn well he better have a very good plot for 
how the heck physics cannot exist! 

In addition, early in the English book translation the story notes what the 
essence of physics is for us, which is the patterns of invariant structures, 
or symmetries to put it more elegantly. Physics is nothing if not the study 
of the most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe.

Newtons' Laws, electromagnetism, Einstein's gravity, quantum mechanics --- 
all can be written in terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing the 
interaction of matter and spacetime.

Hence, and Lui Cixin knows this, for physics not to exist would mean the 
symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory.

This opens up a panoply of something like a Matrix universe, one that is 
programmed and at the whim of the "universal programmer". (Wolfram physics 
ya nerds! ðŸ¤£)  I cannot tell if that is where Lui Cixin takes the story, but 
he has opened up a wide field for the plot. A nice master-stroke. Probably not 
Chinese state propaganda. Just sayin'.

Having not yet gotten to the crux of *Three Body Problem*, I have to insert my 
own bit of politics.


## Harder scifi

I reckon you can take *Remembrance of Earth's Past* as poetic allegory. I am 
damn sure this is not what Lui Cixin was thinking, but I'm telling you this 
is one way I can absorb the whole idea looming in *Three Body Problem*.
Which metaphors then? Well, you can say "Capitalism does not exist, and never 
will exist". But that's almost too comical.

Or is it?

The way I think of the Marxist counter to capitalism is as a bit of a fantasy. 
Neither the capitalists nor the marxists are living in reality as far as I 
can tell. There economics does not exist.  So I'd get my proper poetic analogy 
via "Economics does not exist".

As allegory I'd take this to mean our economy surely exists (as does matter 
and spacetime probably in *Remembrance of Earth's Past*? Not yet sure!) The 
problem is that what *economists think* economics *is* is totally unreal. 
That'd be my poetic take on the *Three Body Problem* story. 

The only trouble is this is a good thing, whereas in the *Three Body Problem* 
it is supposedly getting teed up as a bad thing? ("Physics does not exist" is 
some sort of incipient war on science or intellectuals in the story?) 

This is at least a nice way to enjoy the scifi story, because I am unable to 
enjoy it much as a physicist myself. It is too fantastical, so not good 
enough hard scifi. I cannot tolerate fantasy literature for long periods. 
Short stories with some sort of allegorical moral fable are ok, but the 
immersive fantasy literature stuff is to me like reading superhero comics. 
A complete waste of my time when I was a kid, like Commodore 64 video games.

I know adults indulge in these forms of entertainment, and a million people 
watch reality TV shows. I just don't understand it --- who has that amount of 
free time? Or... what the heck is wrong with me that I don't have such free 
time?

The reason *The Matrix* was cool was because you could read it as allegory for 
a materialistic society. Even if the Wachowski's did not intend for this to be 
the poetic reading. Who has you trapped in the real Matrix? You do. You 
and your ego and insatiable desires for material wealth and comforts. To 
extract yourself from the real Matrix you want to recognize what truly 
matters in your life. And that'd be love and kindness. Waking up from the 
real Matrix means becoming a more spiritual person.

These leads to the extension of my allegory: humanity in our times is in fact 
gripped by the tentacles of an insidious sort of vague ideology. I'd call it 
neoliberalism, but it goes beyond the narrow meaning of that word. It extends 
to the whole plethora of false doctrines in economics, macroeconomics, sociology 
and politics that tells us human beings are mere animals and incapable of peace. 
The idea is we have to be competitive, this is how we survive, we have to 
dominate others, and moreover this is bred into us in our DNA... and so forth. 
I will not belabour the whole blackpill nihilist thesis, there are too many 
varieties, I'm just sketching the cartoon of the idea.  However, I do mean 
to refer to the real world.

It is a pervasive ideology, infecting popular culture and social discourse 
everywhere, and it is ruinous for the chances of a decent civilization. 
However, unlike nihilists, I believe humanity has the collective capacity to 
overcome this narrow dystopian world view. Call me an optimist, a hopeless 
romantic, but it is what I believe is possible. Just don't ask me to offer 
any probabilities. I'd say 100%, but have no clue what the time-frame would 
be. Asymptotics is easy, real-time dynamics is hard to impossible. But this 
is also not the topic of this article today.


## The Farmer and the Shooter Hypotheses

```
TODO:
* The concept in 3BP.
* How it appears in the allegory fo modern politicla economy.
The hapless Tureky, the Foolish Disk Worlder.
* The disanalogy of it, and why some allegories are made to 
be motive to overcome the main problem.
