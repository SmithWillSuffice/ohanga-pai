A few comments this week on 
Michael Hudson and Steve Keen ranting on the 
[DemystifySci podcast (here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q8wgMQjDFI). 
A nice confluence of an offbeat youtube 
channels I occassionally watch and MMM (the framework formerly known as MMT ;-)

I posted comment sthere, but pretty sure they'll get "cleaned" (deleted) 
by someone.  However, DemystifySci often have some interesting content 
on Ai, biotech, and related. It's not all loony tunes, even though sometimes 
it is. Science as entertainment for nerds.

As usual Hudson rants a lot, making extreme exaggerated statements. But I 
have no terrible beef with him, he is in a sense simply countering the 
mainstream economics rhetoric and so helping reject all the neoliberal garbage.


## Caveats

I wrote the comments on the DemystifySci channel in a rush, and a bit 
hot headed. Feel free to 
[contact me](/ohanga-pai/contact/) to let me know if you think I have 
something terribly  wrong.

## Rents are Not Necessary

What started me commenting was when the host guy tried to correct Keen by 
claming some rent is necessary.

The overarching point is that no one should ever need to be forced to pay rent 
on the necessities (food, clothing, shelter, electricity, healthcare). These 
are public services, or should be, so un-privatise them! If your nation wants 
people to be free to charge rent between themselves for non-essentials, 
well... try it out. But for heavens sake, protect the innocent from fraudsters 
and banksters. Regulate the banks, à la 
[Mosler’s proposals](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/proposals-for-the-banking_b_432105).

My comment:
> @58:00 host dude badly wrong here. We do *_not_* need rents. At least not 
for young couples seeking a first home. Housing (and education and healthcare) 
should not be a commodity (see Polanyi).  Governments can always fund the 
first home buyers, and have some of the housing cost repaid as a fair 
proportion of the family income as a tax (not a pay-for) if house construction 
is slow.  None of this is "tax payer funded" because governments issue the 
currency by fiat, it is mere scorekeeping for the government. They impose taxes 
to create demand for the currency, not supply. The government is the supplier. 
Interview Warren Mosler on all this.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, commercial banks are in all cases 
chartered by the state, they are for all effects simply agents of the state. 
They should be tamed as such, because they're dangerous beats. A bank should 
be regarded as a public utility for running the payments system, nothing more, 
except perhaps assessing credit risk. But the credit is again scorekeeping: 
the currency does not come form anywhere, banks just type a number into your 
bank account and an equal number on their books as an asset which records the 
loan (promise to repay). Banks have no business doing any other financial 
activity. This is Mosler's narrow banking proposals. Keep the banks tamed 
and operating in the public interest, not for-profit. The bankers could be 
simply salaried contractors (if you want to avoid excessive politicization) 
or community trusts.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: governments never need a "pay for". 
They issue the currency by accounting entries. They need instead demand for 
the currency, which is the purpose of imposing taxes fees and fines, not to 
"pay for" anything in monetary terms. It's all about real terms (for a fiat 
currency issuer), real resources, not "the money".  It's about "the money" 
only if you have an IOU that no one wants, so you need to earn someone else's 
IOU. State currencies are IOUs of the government, they make people need it 
by imposing taxes (primarily, unless they are oil rich in which case oil 
buyers take their currency). I'l repeat: talk to Warren Mosler.

### Some Elaborations on Rentiers

If an older couple own a house they're not living in then it should be taxed 
away from them if it is not occupied. If they seek to rent it, government 
regulations should automatically kick in to purchase it off them, at fair 
market value. There is no "tax payer" or "bank borrowing" funding this, the 
government just credits the old folks bank account using a computer. Frees up 
the house for that young couple. Older couple have currency they could then 
invest in real production, you might hope. No rentiers. Euthanize them.


### Some Elaboration on Debt Jubilee

Hudson went on a rant claiming the USA cannot cancel debts. He's only half 
right. It is about willingness to pay, not capacity to pay. 

> @1:12:00 c'mon! Governments have *_always_* had the power to cancel debts. 
State currency is simply scorekeeping (with severe legal and economic 
consequences for fraud etc.). Your problem is who controls government --- 
it's the proverbial One Percent. Michael is being disingenuous about the USA. 
All USD issuing private banks are chartered by the state, they cannot exist 
without the US State. The issue is who regulates them? The answer is the 
oligarchs, the One Percent, the bankers get to regulate themselves (as Obama 
allowed). Point is, Obama (c.2008) and Congress should not have allowed them 
to regulate themselves! Nor should any government. Proper role of government 
is to fulfill the public purpose, not private profit. But it'll be private 
profit government until the citizenry seize back control of what aught to 
be _their (the citizenry)_ government apparatus.

I added a bit more...

What I mean is, it's not just China that has the power to cancel private 
debts for poorer households. All governments can, except the eurozone, who 
are no longer sovereign governments, they'd rely on the unelected ECB to 
cancel debts. But even there, the ECB could vote to cancel private debts 
for poorer eurozone households.  It has to be (read: shoudl be) done fairly, 
by a little bit of simple accounting. Households that were defrauded, that 
is, forced to borrow (use their credit cards) from banks to pay for 
electricity, groceries, etc., should get their debt cancelled. 
Not households that took bank credit to buy yachts and condominiums.

Or, a one-time debt jubilee could occur via Prof Keen's idea, to give the 
same lump sum to all households, but those with debt have to pay off their 
debt (so it is automatic) and those without debt have to invest in real 
**_sustainable_** production (according to a sustainable firm schedule, 
also automatic, they get the shares only, not cash). However, this does 
further (needlessly) enrich the One Percent, so I'd apply a simple debt 
jubilee cap if I were supreme benevolent dictator ;-).

But this *also*  in conjunction with Warren Mosler's proposal for eliminating 
the gambling casino that *is* the stock market. I'd limit all share prices
to $\\$$10 max. 
Opening at say $\\$$10. Once the price hits 
$\\$$10/share the firm can sell more shares. Fix price, let quantity float. 
Same as a fiat currency operation should be. The idea is to maximize 
employment --- in this case "employment" in real sustainable goods 
production of available investor equity. Not to make profits for rentiers.

Hudson should not be ranting by claiming the US State cannot cancel debts. 
He's only half right. It is about willingness to pay, not capacity to pay.
