Been reading the essays in 
*[Modern Monetary Theory: Key Insights, Leading Thinkers](https://gimms.org.uk/2023/01/21/modern-monetary-theory/)*
and so might make a few comments over the next weeks.

## Overall

The book is too boring. A lot of excess verbiage. But no matter, all the 
essays are worth reading, just some are real snoozers though.

Also, f$\ast\ast$k!  MMT  is sooo UK centric man! Can't f$\ast\ast$ing 
apply anywhere else, oh... maybe in the EU?  ;-)


### Is Tax a Hygiene factor?

Neil Wilson wrote the chapter 9, 
"*Tax as a hygiene factor: setting UK taxation policy using 
Modern Monetary Theory*".

The way Neil puts the case, for sure, tax is metaphorically 
like economic hygiene.

### A Better Metaphor

Problem is, the core function of taxation is to drive demand for 
the otherwise worthless currency.

Getting a more accurate metaphor, so more like an analogy, can be 
difficult.  We'd need to satisfy at least two critical features:

1. Coercion --- tax is a liability imposed by a governing force.
2. Without the tax the value of the currency "goes to zero" (eventually).

Thing is, a tax-driven currency is a fairly unique sort of thing. 
There's nothing else like it, if there were something like it, it would 
be a currency, so not an analogy, but an isomorphism.

However, Mosler does offer a few near isomorphisms:

* Movie tickets.
* Train passes.
* Theme Park passes.
* Grocery or store vouchers.
* Parents run household chores using their IOU.

None of these have the feel of "hygiene" to me.

**_So what are taxes like really?_**

To answer this a mathematicians hat is superior to an engineers. (Wilson is an engineer.)

The mathematician seeks to abstract and generalize.  When we do so for 
all the above types of "currency" we find taxation is the demand driver 
for an otherwise worthless IOU. What is the pure abstraction then?

> *Generalized tax* is the monopoly force side of a Covenant.  
The other side of the covenant is the citizen.

This works in every case, so is the correct abstraction. The Movie Theatre 
is the monopoly provider of (for a particular local village, let's say) a
film, they tell you what you need to do to get their tickets.

In every case something is promised in redemption, which is why the 
IOU is accepted.

In every case a secondary market can get going with other private goods for 
sale in the tax credit. Movie theatres and theme parks etc., generate 
scalpers. The secondary markets get limited by the existence of a more 
dominant tax. The "need to go to the movies" is not a huge demand driver.

The *need to pay taxes* is an enormous demand driver, it's practically 
debilitating for many, crippling, a source of constant anxiety, it is ruthless.

All the more reason the currency issuer must learn the purpose of their 
tax is not to create such anxiety, and that they have the sole means for 
causing this anxiety, and have a moral obligation to relieve this anxiety.

But not using a UBI. That would defeat the purpose.

The purpose is to provision the state for the greater public good. Once 
the public purpose is achieved with available resources, the tax has 
served proper purpose, the means to pay the tax will have been provided, 
and tax liabilities extinguished.

One source of anxiety is an insatiable desire to "save up" the tax credits.

Why does this not seem to apply to the Movie Theatre or Theme Park? It 
is because they always issue enough of their tax credits to satisfy demand.

Governments do not tend to understand this, because they do not understand 
the purpose of their currency. However, a secondary market is a further 
driver of insatiable savings desires, and the government needs to 
acknowledge this and so provide the demand for the tax credit to satiate 
those desires too --- not just the means to pay the tax. Otherwise 
unemployment will result --- a senseless waste of human lives which 
cripples us all even if many do no feel the pain.

Unemployment is defined by MMT as *people seeking exchange to earn the 
tax credit.*

(You cannot argue with a definition, you can argue that it is not 
common usage.) 

It is thus more than a hygiene factor. Taxation is a Public Covenant, and 
if the Keeper of the Covenant fails to make their side binding we see 
great suffering.
