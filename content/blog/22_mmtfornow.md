In recent times (tackling libertarians and crypto shills on social media) it has 
become glaringly apparent in economics --- macroeconomics in particular --- there is 
a massive culture of hostility to science. However, it is subtle, so worth writing 
about today.
 
## When Science is Unscientific

No macroeconomics saim to be unscientific, at least I think not.

Anyone can claim they are "being scientific" --- say by legitimately using data, 
or logic, or a model.

But that's not automatically *science*. Proper science comes with something extremely 
important that I find the Twitterati often ignore, which is that a proper scientist is 
seeking to falsify their theory, not confirm it.

Theory falsification is not the only activity of a scientist of course, it's just one 
of the main modes of operation. The healthy approach is to advance a theory, but then 
consider it to be collective knowledge, and then adopt a hostile attitude to the 
theory, because ,

> no amount of confirming evidence will ever prove a false theory wrong.

The scientific attitude is to regard all theories as false, and, as the saying goes, 
"some more useful than others."

When is fake science being unscientific then? When all it does is seek confirming 
evidence.


## Is MMT Science, and the Other's Not?

MMT is not science. It is a model or framework for understanding the monetary systems. 
When the postulates of MMT are correct, then one has the start of a scientific 
approach to some limited set of questions in macroeconomic policy.

(I wrote about the postulates of MMT over on the 
[Theory Pages here](/ohanga-pai/questions/1_basic_ohangapai/).)

MMT is thus more like a model. The science occurs when the model is applicable.


### Macroeconomist are Not Willingly Unscientific?

I'll give people the benefit of the doubt. To engage in social discourse it's bets to be conciliatory, and open. A good way to do this is to assume other people are not wilfully is leading or gaslighting.


### MMT For Now

New Zealand has an MMT system, it is easy to check if you adopt a falsification 
stance --- look to see if the postulates of MMT fail to apply.  No such "luck." 
So I can get scientific about understanding macroeconomics in New Zealand using MMT. 
For now.

Maybe tomorrow the Parliament will up-end things completely chaotically? In which 
case, tomorrow I might not be "an MMT'er" in New Zealand context. I'd still 
"be an MMT'er" for the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, or Japan, &c., analyses.

((Depending on the ingenuity of the Parliamntary changes, I might possibly still be 
an advocate for NZ using an MMT system, "going back to MMT" as it were.))

It's easy stuff. I seek falsification. If the tenets of MMT no longer apply to a 
nation, then I discard MMT, for analysis of that nation.

If Austrian School adn Neoclassical sought actively to falsify their models, they 
would no longer be doing macroeconomics with their old models, they'd be doing 
fantasy gaming. The fact none of them seek to falsify their models is evidence they 
are not willingly good scientists i the Popperian tradition, nor in any reasonable 
tradition. They're just mathematicians, that's all.
