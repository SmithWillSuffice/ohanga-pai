We should write a detailed chapter on the concept and imp-act of tariffs. 
However, they are not hard to grok.

The bottom line is they are stupid and pretty bad, for everyone. But with 
an MMT lens we can see they are often the worst for the country imposing 
them! How?

How can the current era (c. 2025) USA regime be so wrong? (And who 
would‚Äôve thought??? ü§£)

## Snappy Version

Michael Green posted a piece at YIGAF that exposed some sort of 
‚Äúcelebrity chef‚Äù figure who was touting himself as enthusiastic about 
the Trump tariffs. For the life of me I could not tell if it was deeply 
sarcastic or plain stupid, nor whether Green was also stupid or just 
so Œ£ for getting the sarcasm.

I hazarded a guess at "plain stupid". So posted this comment as an 
antidote:

>  One ought not be excited by tariffs from any angle? (I would say yeeaah.) 
It is all madness. But if a government knows their monetary system and their 
full available policy space they can always afford to give Trumpistas their 
metaphorical middle finger. The tragedy of these tariff-wars is that 
governments do not understand, so will likely hurt themselves (or their 
people), unaided by Mr Trump. It is all about the policy response, not what 
the other guy does in such matters. US manufacturers want to sell you more 
of their stuff? You can buy. They do not want your stuff? You get to keep 
it (or sell to someone else). All the better for the someone else.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the sanctions placed on 
Russia back-fired, the USA ‚Äúleadership‚Äù have this  backward too, yet so do 
the governments Trump is targeting. They aught to realize they can win big 
from Trump's insane trade policies.

Note: I am not an active academic researcher in this area nor econ journo 
who thinks about tariffs all day long. But you do not need to in order to 
appreciate the mainstream economists have things backwards as usual, and so 
the government policy responses on both sides will likely be all screwed 
up too, since for some godforsaken unknown reason politicians and policy 
wonks still seem to think credentialed economists have useful things to 
say which a 12 year old does not intuitively comprehend. 

In trying to hurt Trump country you will end up hurting your home country.

Retaliation is for war and Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, not for Trade.

OK, that was the Moslertron version.


## The Long Winded Version

Here‚Äôs a sober MMT breakdown of some of the arguments around 
and implications of tariffs.

### Government Revenue and Sovereignty

MMT posits that a currency-sovereign government, like the USA, which issues 
its own fiat currency (USD), does not need to generate revenue through taxes 
or tariffs to fund spending. Instead, it can create money as needed, 
constrained only by inflation risks.

From this perspective, the argument that tariffs "raise revenue" for the 
U.S. government is economically irrelevant under MMT because the government 
does not require external funding to operate. Instead, tariffs act as a 
policy tool with other effects, such as 
[influencing trade flows or domestic production](https://journalistsresource.org/economics/trump-tariffs-webinar/).

### Impact on Importers and Consumers

Tariffs are effectively taxes on imports, which are paid by U.S. businesses 
importing goods, not foreign exporters. This raises costs for U.S. importers, 
who often pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This 
can lead to inflationary pressures and 
[reduced purchasing power for households](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs).

Foreign exporters may respond by raising prices or diverting sales to 
other markets, 
[minimizing their own economic harm](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/). 
Thus, the burden of tariffs could disproportionately fall on U.S. 
entities.  How disproportionate? Entirely depends on the other country‚Äôs 
government policy response level of MMT awareness.  But you know‚Ä¶ it could 
just end up in misery all around.

HHow can I write that? Because the whole idea is to ‚Äúincrease government savings‚Äù! An inapplicable notion when your government is the issuer of the currency. It amounts to demand withdrawal elsewhere. The key question is where is that else? Again, that‚Äôll be a foreing governemtn policy response determination.

Some economics think Canada and Mexico will feel most of the burden, 
but this is false. An MMT perspective would say that'd be true only if the 
Mexican and Canadian government "retaliate" instead of using the more 
appropriate MMT recommended fiscal adjustments. If a foreign entity marks 
prices upwards, the domestic currency can always be re-gauged. This is not 
inflation. It is a one-time adjustment in domestic prices that hurts 
no one. The wage has to go up too, all prices. One-time adjustment.
In fact, it is a good excuse for a wise government to boost low-end wages 
more. Pushing all prices upwards but from the base. 

(If a general price re-gauging is desired, this is _always_ the better way 
to implement the gauging. Just you try stopping the trickle-up! You'd need 
to euthanize the rentiers --- which is a much longer term project.) 

There are other policy responses too, such as seeking other buyers for 
your exports, and the governments of Mexico and Canada can use some light 
subsidies to help the firms dependent on exporting if they so choose. (This 
can also help the one-time price adjustment in a well-targeted fashion.) 
But the real terms of trade are what are more important, the imports! Thus 
retaliation against the USA by making U.S. imports more expensive for your 
own economy is the stupid policy response.

Unfortunately this does not mean Canada and Mexico will not go down the 
stupid path.

Remember: **it is not about jobs!**

Tariffs are never about jobs. If the Tariffman (resp. Tariffwoman) wanted 
more jobs created in the USA (resp. Mexico), they could employ idle 
workers. Almost in any industry, probably even with some executive orders, 
if not, Congressional approval only is needed. The Treasury and FED (resp. 
Central Bank) take marching orders from Congress (resp. Parliament).

They could even construct houses and whole ghost cities for no one to 
live in. The sophisticated Chinese version of Keynes' "digging ditches and 
fill them in again". They at least had something to show for the 
construction company grift. 

The central government can always employ anyone not employed by the 
private sector, without incurring inflationary pressures. This is simply a 
_policy choice_. After first expanding public services if desired, the 
policy choice is then whether to run an unemployed labour buffer or a fully 
employed labour buffer.


### Trade Deficits and Real Goods

MMT views imports as a net benefit because they provide real goods and 
services in exchange for financial claims (currency) that the U.S., as a 
sovereign issuer of dollars, can [create at will](https://www.moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf). Conversely, exports 
are seen as a cost because they involve sending real resources abroad.

Imposing tariffs reduces imports, which MMT proponents argue harms the U.S. 
by limiting access to these real goods while doing little to benefit 
exporters who can 
[find alternative markets](https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=61890). 
This aligns with the critique that tariffs hurt the U.S. economy more 
than they help.


### Economic Costs of Tariffs

Most [empirical analyses](https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-tariffs-potential-implications) 
shows that tariffs reduce GDP growth, employment, and 
investment in the long run. For example:

* The proposed Trump-era tariffs 
[could shrink U.S. GDP](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/) by up to 1.3% and 
cost over a million full-time jobs if fully implemented.
* Tariffs also lead to dollar appreciation, making U.S. exports less 
competitive globally and further harming domestic producers reliant on international markets 
(see [‚ÄúA global economist‚Äôs take on tariffs‚Äù](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs)). 
* Without complementary industrial policies to boost domestic production, 
tariffs alone fail to achieve meaningful economic benefits while imposing 
significant costs on consumers and businesses _[Ibid.](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-02-03/tariffs)_.

## Conclusion

Recognize most of the Tumpo doctrines are just designed to cause havoc. 
No _other_ rhyme nor reason is needed for them. But you have ways to avoid 
the havoc if you have the pleasure of living somewhere else and have 
government powers.

From an MMT perspective, tariffs are counterproductive for a 
currency-sovereign nation like the U.S., as they harm domestic consumers 
and businesses while reducing access to beneficial imports. Empirical 
data supports this view, showing that tariffs depress economic growth 
and employment without significantly benefiting domestic industries unless 
paired with broader industrial strategies.

The appropriate policy response of a government feeling it‚Äôs exporters 
are going to be hurt by the tariffs imposed by Tariffman is to;  
**(a)** recognize your exporters have no place at any trade negotiation 
table on your end, their interest is in the wealth of the foreign buyers, 
and the suppression  of your domestic workers. (b) You can always ensure 
full non-ÍïóÍñπÍùÜÍùÜÍï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° employment and have a great standard of living. 
**(c)** There is always a buyer for your stuff.  Judicious fiscal adjustment 
can avoid all the pain, can avoid 100% of the pain.
