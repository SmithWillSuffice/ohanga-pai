A nice change-up from recent posts today, I get to comment on Randall Wray's 
chat with Grumbine,
[ Defining Value with L. Randall Wray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTARhp5qS8) on 
Real Progressives, March 10 2024.

How could I possibly add any value to what Wray has to say on use of a monetary 
unit to communicate economic value? Amazingly there was a door Wray left 
slightly open.

### Labour Theory of Value is Not Total Value

Wray does a nice job summarizing Marx, and not in the Monty Python Proust 
way, although that would have been cool too. (Someone should do that skit.)
He leaves out a lot of Steve Keen's contribution, which is unfortunate, but 
it's an "ok" for beginners.

To follow are some bullet-point style further summaries, they are essential 
points of note before reading the rest of my post.

1. Marx did not understand money, he borrowed too much uncritically from 
Ricardo and Adam Smith. Even a little bit of a bad thing can be a bad thing. 
In mathematics one little error can destroy the entire edifice. Thus, when in 
doubt, you use probabilities, not didactic statements as if you are the boss 
of all economics philosophy. Marx played too much the boss.
2. The gold commodity is not the state's monetary unit, and so cannot be the 
source of the price level.
3. One might estimate the labour time + energy to dig gold out of the ground, 
but this is a laughable theory of how the price is determined. One cannot 
use a single operation or process. Prices are always nominal, and gain social 
currency only when pegged or gauged against some common real process. Digging 
gold out of the Earth is not a common enough process for a decent theory of 
monetary value. This renders most of Marx's analysis of the "money form" 
ridiculous and obsolete.
4. All real value is derived from a combination of free energy + labour.
5. In a fair political economy the relative real values would be reflected in the nominal value, the latter is the currency unit of account.
6. In all current political economies there is no fairness, and the nominal 
values do not correlate well with the relative real values. Prices are not 
entirely random, but the relative ratios are heavily distorted by those who 
wield undue political power over others.
7. Nevertheless, the only one relative value that truly matters is the price 
of labour. But 
this is not saying the LTV is correct. What is morally true is that 
*in a **fair** system* the workers would be fairly compensated, so their 
labour would be accurately valued in nominal terms, by comparison with real 
output *the entire system* can produce.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If it is not possible to measure real 
output, it can still be estimated. Statisticians and decent 
econometricians are not total dummies. Hence workers can always be granted 
an approximately fair compensation. Disgruntlement at the edges, although 
something to be minimized, is not a completely terrible thing to have to 
tolerate if the alternative is an autocracy.)
8. Principle **7** says that if it is possible to measure real output (within 
reasonable uncertainty bounds) then workers can always be granted a wage 
commensurate with their fair share of that output. This cannot be market 
determined.
9. Point **8** says wages cannot be market determined, this is because markets 
distort relative prices whenever there is accumulation of monopoly pricing 
power. In such cases the monopoly currency issuer has a moral obligation to 
make the workers whole. This is because, as MMT shows, the monopoly currency 
issuer is the price setter, not price taker. They do so by providing a wage 
floor via a Job Guarantee. The JG policy is not merely economic pragmatism, 
it is also moral pragmatism (the bare minimum moral economic policy).
10. Defining a unit of account is remarkably similar to defining engineering 
units, like "the kilogram", or "the second", or "the metre", and "the ampere".
Only because governments (the people who run them) have no clue about this, 
they turn what should be an exact isomorphism into less than a mere analogy, 
they do not even think of the state currency unit in such metrology terms, but 
they *should*.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuffs up a lot of things in society, 
so much is f$\ast\ast$d up in fact that it is an epic tragedy. As in 
*biblically epic*.

I don't blame Marx for this epic tragedy. Everyone who was sucked-in by 
Adam Smith and Ricardo is to blame --- so millions of people can be blamed? 
Yeah, I would say millions. That's on the low side. You should not follow 
tradition unless you carefully scrutinize it and find it agreeable, true, 
kind, and honest.

Adam Smith's economics came from a good place, he was a moral philosopher, but 
that does not make the analysis he handed down to Marx any more honest or good 
and healthy to swallow. 
Marx may have had a deep and abiding concern and compassion for the working 
class, but because he was morally righteous in this respect does not excuse 
his careless and uncritical acceptance of large chunks of Adam Smith's 
thought.

I could say the same for MMT. We should not uncritically accept MMT analysis. 
You need to always take an MMT analysis as fresh: have they considered 
political power? Have they considered spiritual economics (kindness, altruism, 
compassion, sacrifice, ecological sensitivity)? If not, then I'd not want to 
give it any credence or attention, no matter how correct the analysis was in 
monetary system comprehension.


### Some Comments Through the Open Door

In lieu of more academic writing, I'll just for now paste the comments I made 
below the Real Progressive eidos with Randy Wray.

**Thoughts on the "need to read" Marx:**

> [@19:00](https://youtu.be/-QTARhp5qS8?t=1158) I have something to tell 
fellow MMT'ers. You could bother to read 
Marx but only to be able to be sympathetic to actual living marxists. If you 
are already sympathetic then reading *Das Kapital* is a waste of your precious 
time${}^\ast$.  There is nothing in Marx's works that is not better understood 
in the MMT literature. Even power dynamics and "capitalism" (if you find the
good MMT stuff, like Mitchell).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${}^\ast$Because anything you get from 
Marx that the living marxist does not accept is useless in your 
dialogue/dialectic with them, and anything they think is in Marx which is 
incorrect is useless to you in the dialectic with them. Instead, read a bit 
of Marx, and then when you encounter an actual living marxist just ask them 
their opinion. In fact this works wonders for dialectic with any ideologue of 
any colour or stripe,... yes, even a libertarian LOL. You need to understand 
where they are coming from, make the effort to talk in peace.


**Thoughts on theory of value:**  
> [@24:30](https://youtu.be/-QTARhp5qS8?t=1441) this leaves some territory 
open for me to blog about. Wray's version 
of LTV is fine for what it is, but in the real world things do not actually 
trade over the counter according to LTV. Plus you are missing S. Keen --- not 
all real value put into real output is from labour, in fact these days labour 
is a minuscule amount, meaning you need to look at how energy is produced 
using all that "dead labour" + free energy from Nature. Better to give this 
a proper name, like "Total energy theory of value" which accounts for both 
labour and free energy, let's call it TETV let's say.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know lower level workers are 
grossly under-paid, and a tonne of commodity is way over-priced, sometime 
ridiculously (a van Gogh, or a Gucci thing, etc). On top of the LTV + we have 
TETV, but on top of TETV we have TSTV = Total Social Theory of Value --- which 
accounts not just for labour + free energy but for people who have more 
social power who are able to monopolize sources of free energy (primarily 
land and the sun light that shines upon the land). Those people have a huge 
say in determining the monetary unit exchange value, and if given too much 
power they can completely subvert the more natural LTV (which discounts 
nature's free energy) and can make workers pay through the nose for simple 
commodities necessary for a humble decent non-ostentatious life.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It begs the question when reading Marx 
and derivatives, what the heck good is LTV when all the socially important 
factors in living a decent life are completely subverted in price by 
political power? Answer is, LTV is only good for stupid nerds who like to 
idly think about a toy model -- the, "what if political power had no say in 
price determination..."  --- completely useless thinking time.



### Robot Theory of Value

About 26 mins in Wray talks about various other "theories of value". In our 
times we should be looking at "oil theory of value"". In a mechanized future 
perhaps a "robot theory of value". That all sounds nice and good, but what 
does it really mean?

If the robots and self-reproducing, then who really needs a theory of robot 
value? What we would require is a theory of robot control. Then this must 
be implemented!

It is no good having self-replicating robots if they only serve the Top Ten 
Percent, leaving us plebs "free" to fight over the scraps, over the robot 
surplus.

It should be then clear that a proper "theory of value" cannot ignore the 
moral dimension. Yet all economics theories of value ignore the moral 
dimension. Marx did come closest to a moral economics.

In such a scifi future, which God willing may become sci-fact, we will still 
need a labour theory of value. Even if humans are doing far less work, and 
have far more leisure, we will still need to be working hard to help each 
other, in whatever way. Even with robotic assistance all around. Since we 
would have been the creatures who created the robots, we aught not relinquish 
our status as creators. There is simply no need to be nihilistic about a 
roboticized dystopia where humans become extinct due to our worthlessness. 
Such nihilism is patently absurd. Yet, nor should we go the other extreme 
and grant ourselves lordship and domain over Nature. Nature Bats Last, so is 
always ready (so-to-speak) to humble the arrogant.
