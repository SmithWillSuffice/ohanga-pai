I found a nice lunch-break series on youtube from some economics nerds 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UULFJG8N5P1RFX29JTKt_6R21A)
on [ergodicity in economics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UULFJG8N5P1RFX29JTKt_6R21A).
It is worth a few comments.

These are econophysics bros, but among the finance bro nerds, these guys 
seem to be of the decent variety. There is a trace of a hint of some level of 
concern for the plight of the poor in their work.

## Wealth Reallocation Models

There are many simple models for how financial wealth gets distributed. 
Unfortunately most are politically neutral or politically agnostic. So all 
are unrealistic. However, they are empirically accurate. How can that be?

Firstly, modelling macroeconomics is a lot like some aspects of statistical 
mechanics, where there can be phenomena akin to multiple realization: meaning 
more than one underlying dynamics or set of governing rules could determine 
the same qualitative macroscopic behaviour.

Secondly, in the real world governments do not behave as if they have a 
monopoly control of their own tax credits (aka. the currency) and so a lot of 
economic injustices occur due to plain ignorance --- a massively tragic for of 
banal evil. If governments cause unemployment in the first place (as MMT shows) 
then a morally agnostic government operating according to quasi free market 
ideology --- welfare for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor --- 
will practically guarantee end results that are Pareto tailed --- the rich 
get richer.

The econophysics bros models capture such politically "agnostic" dynamics. 
Only the problem is they fail to realize this is political mismanagement on an 
epic and tragic scale. It is not agnosticism at all.

Sure, you might be justified in claiming absent a currency monopoly there 
would be some kind of free market, then those models become applicable. The 
result is a free market always evolves to extreme injustice --- highly 
unequal distribution of financial wealth. (Hence real wealth too, since 
financial wealth equates to real purchasing power. The more money (scorepoints) 
you can rake in from rentier activity, the more you can purchase without 
reduction in your hoard of financial scorepoints.

I am not claiming any particular reason the econophysics models seem to 
accurately account for real world wealth distribution, just pointing out some 
possible explanations.  But*one thing is for certain*: the real world data 
is drawn from nations that run MMT systems. So it is clear that governments 
in these nations have the operational ability to eliminate the Pareto tails 
and ensure fair & just wealth distributions. Meaning if politics were good, 
serving the public purpose, then the econophysics bro's 'models would be 
wrong.

That is really my main point today.

> The econophysics models might be correctly capturing some aspects of 
macroeconomic real-world dynamics, but the main point to make is that this 
does not mean the real world *should* be as it is: we could do much better.


### Negative $\tau$

The simple stochastic geometric Brownian motion model for wealth reallocation 
is definitely a politically agnostic model, so pretty disgusting. But that is 
because our political economy is pretty disgusting. Yes, for sure, all you 
Enlightenment nerds: human civilization has progressed for the good, in so 
many ways, but that does not imply we are at a stage of decent political 
economy. It just means all past human history where power elites have been 
found, it has been diabolically nasty and brutal.

In [Yonatan Bermanâ€™s model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7j4eO4Kbls&list=UULFJG8N5P1RFX29JTKt_6R21A&index=2&pp=iAQB) 
the main control parameter $\tau$ alolows for interactions between individuals, 
and this is what allows the dynamics to become non-ergodic.

It is seriously important in the econophysics, because non-ergodicity is 
characteristic of the real-world. The long time average of a distribution of 
wealth is not the same as the average over all infinite possible ensembles.
models where the time average equals the ensemble average are ergodic, and 
this is not the real-world situation. 

((Why so seriously important? It is because these econophysics models are all 
about the statistical mechanics, so the statistical characteristics are the 
only thing they need to get right, so they need to get (non)ergodicity --- and 
other statistical characterizations --- right, if nothing else.))

In particular, the models show that in times when in the real world the 
effective $]\tau <0$ are times of increasing return to the rich, when 
inequality soars. These are non-ergodic periods. It is pretty revealing to 
see the data estimates showing the periods in recent history where such 
instability occurs, the following screenshot is Barman's data.

### All We Need is a Warp Drive

I want to return to my main point:  
_The econophysics models might be correctly capturing some aspects of 
macroeconomic real-world dynamics, but the main point to make is that this 
does not mean the real world *should* be as it is: we could do much better._

And we can do better without any heavy-handed social engineering or forced 
communism or the like. We can do better simply if, **(a)** governments 
understand they have at least tow unique and powerful monopoly instruments 
(the legal and the monetary system, the former includes military and police 
power). And **(b)** we have real serious democratic control of our 
governments, meaning they bend to "the people's" will, not to the will of 
the oligarchs.

When I write, "simply if" please know that I realize this does not mean 
politically or sociologically simple. It means operationally simple. The 
politics messes you up. "All we need is the correct moral and ethical 
political will to do good...", is a phrase a lot like interstellar travel 
plans: "All we need is a Warp drive...".

However, I am not a pessimist nor nihilist. We can find this macroeconomics 
"warp drive". It is not a scifi fantasy. That is because the macroeconomics 
warp drive is not a physical thing, it does not have to be materially 
engineered. It is a spiritual reality, it is love for other people, compassion, trustworthiness, humility, compassion, justice, mercy, forgiveness, wisdom.
That is our political economy warp drive.

It costs nothing material to get it. It costs suppression of ego and greed.
Which is why it seems incredibly hard to get. No one can legislate better 
morality. Moral and ethical transformation has to be learned, nurtured, grown, 
and fostered with the metaphorical water of wisdom and kindness.


## Power

This is something everyone who learns MMT eventually comes to appreciate. 
MMT is a necessary step in the battle, but it is only a first step. Yeah, it 
can be taken in parallel with other steps.

But once you realize a government has amazing monopoly powers, you realize the 
magnitude of the task ahead. Those wielding that power fail to acknowledge MMT, 
and hide their wilful or innocent ignorance behind veils of "let the markets 
do their magic" parables. Such market ideology is in fact anti-democratic.
But it gets endlessly paraded as a manifestation of democracy and freedom.

The task for pursuit of greater justice is thus truly immense.

We are talking biblical in scale, lest it be not obvious!
