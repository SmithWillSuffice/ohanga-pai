By "politicians" I would like to mean _anyone_ involved in policy, so that 
includes civil servants and people who vote, and people who suppress the 
vote, and people who do good things so others don't have to think too much 
to worry about the vote. But for this article I will restrict to the 
normative use of "an elected representative."
I'd like to thank GhostOnTheHalfShell for some inspiration.

The question is: **what can local councils and regional councils do when the 
central government restricts their budget?**

**The framing (MMT):** the local councils are not constrained by revenues. 
The tax receipts do not fund the local government. 

Can they simply run a local currency to drive full employment and 
prosperity? (You cannot be optimally prosperous with a single person 
unemployed.)

## Level 0 Answer --- are you an agent of the state?

Far too many n00bie MMT'ers, I suspect, worry local councils depend on 
tax receipts. But local councils are no different to the central 
government departments. They are agents of central government. 

No governments (that I know of) ever spend directly "as The Government".

The tax payer is not funding the local government because the tax payer's 
I.O.U. is typically worthless. The local governments are funded by the 
central government which is self-funding.

This is supposed to be MMT-101, so I hope Jim Byrne is reading. 
Which reminds me, I changed my mind and think Scotland is a better place 
for MMT Knowledge to grow (as well as Samoa and Barbados), since they 
have a strong _existential_ (sort of) need for Independence. So Scottish 
people are primed for learning MMT like no others, I suspect. What 
Scottish national of sound mind would not like to give Westminster 
the middle finger?

Your Whisky exports are a real cost, but in this case it is the 
exception which breaks the rule: send the British Upper Crust more 
whisky, as much as you can, to rot their livers. Soften up their military 
too like this, then when their livers give up, invade with country 
dancers and bagpipe terrorism.


## Level 1 Answer --- Local currency?

Yes, they can run a local currency and a Job Guarantee. All they need is 
a secure spreadsheet. Maybe one administrator (if the software automation is 
in place) --- who is there mainly to prevent fraud. I guess if there is 
initially a lot of fraudulent attempts to game the system (create ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ 
jobs) maybe two administrators. One with a "gun" called 'Local Fines Due' 
crafted by 'Pay or We Knock on Your Door Politely Limited'.

Don't be triggered little anarchists. this is just records of social 
obligations. The Mosler machine gun/Uzi metaphor is apropo I think, the 
government is damaging you _in far more ways than you have imagined_${}^\ast$ 
by imposing tax liabilities and failing to give you the means to redeem.

${}^\ast$A topic for another day.

The problem is to permit payment of central government taxes with the 
local currency.

There is a bank clearing obstacle here, depending on institutional 
structure in the country. Some local councils might be able to easily 
get around the legalities, others might not.

It can become a political battle. But my comment to Ghost was this is 
one worth fighting, losing is not the fear. Not fighting is the fear.
Just by fighting the issue is raised and veils of neoliberal myths can be 
torn down and obliterated, even if we lose.

My guess is a trouble is that local counsellors do not have the courage 
because they want to get re-elected. They do not want to lose their income. 
SO they are spineless and gutless, but I would understand. I would be too 
if I was living comfortably and had a mortgage to pay. (No I wouldn't be 
so spineless, but I had to stick that deflation in so as not to appear 
too rude.)



## Level 2 Answer --- The courage

We had a local counsellor turn up for our local viewing of the film 
_[Finding the Money](https://findingmoneyfilm.com/)_ 
who said some local counsellor "knew MMT" but lacked the power to increase 
their budget.

I told her they have power and can use a local currency to drive full 
employment.

Guess what happened?

Even the MMT bigwig academics stomped on me and told me I was being unfair.
I guess they are deaf? I don't know. 

In Wellington we even have two names for the currency ready for debate:
* The Shake (we get earthquakes).
* The Hurricoin (our Rugby team are the Hurricanes). I cam e up with that 
one so it gets my vote.

But apart from a name (the hardest thing), the rest is just local council 
policy implementation. Pretty easy.

I know what you are thinking!  Never underestimate the power of the 
bureaucratic deep state to spill the ball.  We could start a list of the 
things they'll say to avoid implementation. But that'd be too depressing.

The worst thing is, imagine they eventually see a local currency working 
in another region driving a significant increase in prosperity there. What 
will they think? 

> "Oh my idiot obstinance and bureaucratic conservatism 
lost us four years of real output that can never be recovered."  
?

Yeah, right. 

However, there are local currencies operating around the world, a few, 
not too many. But they are success stories.  We even have one system 
in New Zealand, the [Wairarapa Green Dollars](http://wais.org.nz/index.php/faqs) 
or LETS system. Been running since 1991.

The greatest success is [they exist!](https://centerforneweconomics.org/apply/local-currencies-program/localcurrenciesdirectory/) 
So no fussy bureaucrat here complaining a local currency would be 
"too much bureaucracy" has a leg to stand on.

Can you taste the irony of that!?


## Level 3 Answer --- Prosperity

We can never be prosperous just with full employment. The type of 
production matters, and we do not want it to be electricity guzzling 
A̶I̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶e̶l̶s̶  machines for spitting out strings stochastically 
that turn a simpleton into a Dall-E Picasso, or Taylor Swift knock-off 
composer. This would be wasteful and we would 
[DOGE their ꗇꕷꕷ to Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVOZfAJwntk)${}^\dagger$.

${}^\dagger$Is that a tasteless joke? I can't tell.

At the very minimum we want machines for generating Radiohead knock-offs.
only _then_ are we at full quality employment, hence max prosperity.


## Level 4 Answer --- Doh!

We do not need local currencies! The central government can always allow 
local government to have an overdraft facility. The purpose is full 
employment, not money supply finagleling. 

But while the central government is run by dinosaurs and oligarchs, 
local action is required. Local action is a moral responsibility I would say.

If you get elected to regional council your job is not to worry about 
getting re-elected. Part of your job is to herd central gov politicians, 
and while that is harder than herding cats, there are ways. Embarrassment 
is not something a cat can suffer.
