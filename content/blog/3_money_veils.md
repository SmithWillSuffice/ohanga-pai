There are several veils surrounding money, some theoretical and philosophical, 
some practical and real. I started writing this essay after a friend 
([Douglas the MMT Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader)) 
suggested I listen to Perry Mehrling's lectures on money and banking, 
which cover as reading material the collected works of Allyn Young. 

After only a short browse through Mehrling's book on the collected works of 
Allyn Young I discovered a few interesting things related to MMT that I thought 
worth blogging about.

I wanted to write them down before finishing the lectures and book, 
to see if I get my mind changed (which is always the aim of all my study, 
exciting when it happens).
I am going to write *ahistorically* here, because I do not yet know all of 
Allyn Young's work, so to me he is a fictional character that I am using as 
an avatar to write about the role of money in a macroeconomic system.

## Money and Growth

One of the major themes of Allyn Young's thought was his contribution to 
the economics professions understanding of how monetary systems are **_not_** 
a mere "veil over barter," but that rather monetary operations and institutions 
are critical for helping and hindering real economic growth and prosperity.

So far this aligns with MMT thought.

But Young also seemed to implicitly understand that money forms were not truly 
the crucial thing, and that the performance of the monetary system was only a 
means to an end, that end being the fair and just distribution of real output. 
Settlement of obligations in other words.

This seems to align somewhat with neoclassical economics and the 
"money **_is_** a veil over barter story, but only if by "barter" we generalize to 
"any trade in goods or social currency of debts, feuds and other obligations."

((Which I think helps make it crystal clear the neoclassical 'Adam Smith' barter 
story is both incomplete and reactionary --- because it either implies money 
is *only* about barter in goods, or in the generalized sense it implies people who 
have money are in 'social credit' and hence have rightfully by divine decree earned 
their position (as if theft, exploitation, corruption, and piracy were prevented 
by divine decree of the Invisible Hand).))

The proper nuance is that MMT is correct and neoclassicals are wrong, and the way 
Allyn Young would have arrived at this conclusion is because he seemed to understand 
the imposition of two opposing social forces,

1. that monetary operations *are* a crucial friction that if abused by the rich 
and powerful can be severe obstacles to justice, *and*
2. that the money form itself *can* function far better than a veil over barter, 
because it can facilitate trade and commerce.

The clear implication is that the role of a currency monopolist is to minimize 
(1) and maximize (2). That is, the government *should* (not that they do, 
just that they should) play a role in the monetary economy by suppressing the 
abuse of the money form by the most powerful, and facilitate trade so that 
money does become more of a mere veil. 

MMT, I think, would agree. (By "MMT would think..." I mean all the MMT aware scholars 
and activists.) The MMT system itself does not think, so can not agree nor 
disagree with anything.

But you see the tension. MMT emphasises the role of money and banking in a way 
that [Steve Keen\'s Goodwin-Minsky 
models](https://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2014/01/15/some-sample-minsky-models/) 
vividly describe dynamically 
(against almost all neoclassical myths). But in the realm of political economy MMT 
de-emphasises the importance of holding the currency unit when (and *only when*) it 
comes to government policy considerations.

### The first veil

I am not going to say all this is some wort of metaphysical characterisation, I'm 
just free-flow writing here, and this veil is the first one to pop out.

The veil is the way money is so heavily used in commercial trade that the 
true origins hisotry gets obscured, the use of money is thus a veil over the true 
history and origins.

The origins of money are well understood by archeologists and anthropolgits, 
[Knapp](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.227879), 
[Mitchell-Innes](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Credit-and-State-Theories-of-Money%3A-The-of-A.-Innes-Wray-Innes/33d30d281d676b3f81d5d8cb567deb1903c50f87), 
[Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years),
[Hudson](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291759036_The_archaeology_of_money_Debt_versus_barter_theories_of_money's_origins), 
[Wray]() among others. 
The true history is that forms of temple, emperor or state authority currency, all 
arose from settlement of debts and thus were records of credit. Every debt had a 
corresponding credit. 

For sure, double entry book-keeping was a much later invention, but before 
book-keeping people held these records of obligations well enough in their heads. 
Any record of such debt or credit is a form of money in the highly abstract sense, 
an I.O.U. 
In a material sense monetary units properly came into existence when grain weights 
of rice or barley or wheat were used as an artifice or stand-in for those records. 
Of course paper records that were reliable could have been used, and before solving 
the forgery problem of paper records was discovered, tally sticks were pretty good 
currency records.

Note that none of this implies a currency unit was *always* the creation of the 
government state (which is 
[narrow Chartalism](https://read.dukeupress.edu/hope/article-abstract/52/4/773/165508) ). 
Sometimes a means of settlement of debts (so a currency as a means of payment) can be 
created outside of a government, perhaps by a feudal lord, an oligarch, religious 
temple, or some other power or authority or collective.

The MMT story of money is still chartalist, but is *generalized chartalism* --- 
which means it almost always practically takes some power or authority to run the 
currency unit payments system. They have to be either rusted, feared, or both. 

### Helping and Hindering

This duality in MMT exists in any institutionally arranged system, it is almost a 
tautology, because unless something is a deterministic machine designed and built to 
function perfectly, then the system it runs will have imperfections, some may help 
bias outcomes in a good way, some in a bad way.

For example, some of us joke that Dick Cheney was the most accomplished MMT policy 
maker in the past 25 years. Mostly for the bad.

John Maynard Keynes and J K Galbraith were the most accomplished MMT policy makers 
during the World War 2 era. Mostly for the good (at least by the account their sides 
won the war, and to the extent hat success had anything to do with moving private 
production into the public sector for that period).

Successful war time efforts are examples of where there is one type of veil of 
money. Everyone works for the war effort, and issuing enough currency is not even 
debated. The issuer always "finds" enough currency. They do so either by extending 
the artifice of a gold standard, or they just implement pure fiat money operations 
without the gold standard veil.

The gold standard is thus revealed (by wars) to be a veil. There never really was a 
gold standard. The currency is always a tax credit, and the issuer tells you what 
it is worth.  If they tell you it redeems for $\pi/100$ ounces of gold, then that's 
the fiat price. What it can purchase then depends upon the relative price of gold to 
their goods, but that is still a choice of the currency issuer. 

Like control of nuclear power and primitive fire, a powerful force or technology 
can always be used to commit atrocities. MMT is no exception. But the monetary 
system is ancient,has existed for over 4000 years, and is often a force for good when 
used wisely. It is not a free market or natural equilibrium that achieves good or 
terrible social outcomes, it is our wilful design, or negligence.

((That was another near tautology: if a pure free market was ever to exist, it would 
be by human conscious willful design. My thought on that is always that what most 
people desire is a *fair* market, not a *free* market. Freedom implies all sorts of 
bad things, through fallacies of composition: everyone is free to stand up in the 
sets at a football game or the opera, but they don't, they constrain themselves 
for the 'greater good.' The greater good, and hence the constraint, is really more 
freedom* not less, because we are now talking about different qualities of freedom. 
All freedoms are not equal in quality. Freedom absolutists are knuckleheads, to use 
a technical term.))

### The second veil

The second veil of money is the way the idea occurs to unthinking people that 
'having money' is seen as prestige and by default almost taken as implying the person 
with lots of money has earned it, and so is a 'good person' or has been 'hard 
working'.

Sometimes this is true, veils are like that, they will often reveal a 
true silhouette.

Money as this veil obscures corruption and greed, and obscures the fact 
the poorest people are not deserving of being poor. Only MMT recognizes why this is 
true, because MMT understands the source of all unemployment in a monetary economy 
--- and that source is not laziness or apathy.

MMT in this fashion follows in the tradition of W Edwards Deming, who pointed out to 
Japanese management (or any management experts who would listen) that they should 
not punish the lowest performing workers, because no matter how perfect their 
production system, with all workers top notch talents, there is always a lowest 
performer to be found. Being the lowest performer in a given period thus means next 
to nothing. The system as a whole has to be judged, not the trivially existing 
least productive worker. 

Deming said that if you have a poor performing worker who should "on paper" be an ok 
worker, something is more likely wrong with the system.


## Money and Institutions

At the governmental level, and **_only_** at the governmental level, 
MMT tells us our **_already existing_** monetary and legal institutions make 
the state currency units mere scorepoints --- as far as the government is 
concerned --- and so to a government policy maker, their unit of account, 
the state currency (but only *their* state's currency) is a mere veil over the 
business of banking and commerce regulation.

But this is absolutely critical awareness, and too many people on both the 
political "left" and the "right" fail to see this dual aspect to money, specifically 
state currency (not private money forms).

To caricature the political divides somewhat, I'd say,

* the lefties see money as "evil" (in some sense) but focus on the power of 
money and how this is unfairly distributed. They fail to recognise the 
full MMT picture because they do not see that the governments control the state 
currency system, so are not beholden to collecting taxes off rich people. 
(There are many other ways governments can ensure that there is no undue wealth 
inequality in society, e.g., to prevent unbridled capital accumulation in the 
first place).
* the right-winger see money as essential, but *only* as a veil over barter, 
because they cannot bring themselves to see any essential role for a government 
in private commerce. They fail to recognize the full MMT picture because they 
do not understand what drives a monetary numeraire.

On the right-wingers for a second: we know that what drives demand for a 
fiat currency is imposition of liabilities of some kind or another, 
and it has never been any other way throughout all history. 
In fact one pretty good definition of "money" is that "money" is an 
I.O.U. --- a promise of the issuer to redeem. That is equivalent to a 
record of credit and debt (the issuer is in debt, the receiver in credit, 
when the receiver of the I.O.u> returns it to the issuer the debt is 
redeemed and the creditor is back to zero credit.)

Right-wingers fail to understand all past and present monetary systems 
because they cannot wrap their heads around this definition of "money." 
To most right-wingers "money" is some physical substance, like gold,
and so they hate this concept of a fiat currency which is nothing but 
scorepoints on secured ledger books.

One can go ahead and use the concept of a physical stuff like gold, as "the money".
But then you have to re-wire all your macroeconomic models, and to my knowledge 
no one has ever successfully done this. More critically, in practice, no nation 
has ever implemented such a commodity money system, though many right-wingers 
seem to think those systems have existed. 

In eras of feudal rule, when empires had broken down, it is true that at some 
times gold coins or other metals, were used as a socially understood commodity 
currency, but the problem is that this relied upon ass social misconception. 
The metal coins always traded for goods according to the numeraire stamped on the 
coins. This was never held equal to the trade value of the actual metal (which was 
normally a lot less than the numeraire face value on the coins --- because otherwise 
people would quickly learn to melt down the coins (often illegally) to sell them).

I often allow other philosophers and activists to have their own definitions, and so 
if a right-winger comes along and insists "money" is a commodity like gold, I would 
normally (if this were mapped to a science problem) let it go. But we 
cannot"let it go" "when it comes to macroeconomics, because it makes a huge f-ing 
difference whether or not the state currency units we get tax liabilities imposed 
upon us in are real stuff or mere scorepoints.

You want it to be scorepoints.

Why?  Because you do not want to motivate pirates. Because you want the regulator of 
this system to be able to actually implement some justice, to balance the economy so 
that increasing returns to wealth do not become an automatic destabiliser. It is 
critical for justice. Even right-wingers like justice. So they aught to want a fiat 
currency system (points on the government scoreboard.)

But sometimes there is just no getting through to the reactionary minds of 
conservatives, who seem to simply be genetically ill-disposed to all forms of 
government encroachment upon private markets.

This is highly ironic, because a market in a semblance of democratic state currency 
does not exist without a government force (tax collector imposing the return of the 
liabilities). The trouble for right-wing libertarians is that if a state government 
does not exist, you only get something worse, which is a landlord imposing their 
own private liabilities upon you ("give me half your grain and sheep or AI burn your 
hut down.")

### The third veil

Because money is seen as an instrument of the most powerful, because having excess 
credit gives someone more purchasing power, this store-of-value function of state 
currency is a veil over the proper role of an ideal democratic state.

It is because people hate to see a Leviathan exerting power over the "little people" 
that a big government (big brother) is seen as anathema. 
This is however a veil over the reality that without government the "little people" 
(aka. the working class) are even more entirely screwed.

It is better to have the monopoly currency issuer protecting the working class than 
have the workers fend for themselves in some libertarian anarcho-capitalist fantasy 
world. 

The problem is our governments have never been protectors of the working class. All 
gains made by the working class have been by collectivist approaches exerting 
influence upon governments, at the chagrin of the people running the government. 

The government is a crucial institution for worker emancipation. But workers cannot 
just sit back and wait for their rights to be granted. Human rights have to be 
exerted, have to be fought for, and have to be won on moral grounds well before they 
are won on material grounds. 

The way Warren Mosler has put this is that: **_The Labour market is not a fair 
game_** The role of a democratic government is to balance that playing field. Workers 
need more protection than the bosses.

When people adopt the view that money should be a private system, they are placing 
this veil over the rightful role of democratic government.

## To Conclude?

I think there are other veils of money, but I'll stop at these three for now.
I think they are the most important veils to understand.
