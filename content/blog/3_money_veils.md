There are several veils surrounding money, some theoretical and philosophical, 
some practical and real. I started writing this essay after a friend 
([Douglas the MMT Trader](https://www.patreon.com/mmtmacrotrader)) 
suggested I listen to Perry Mehrling's lectures on money and banking, 
which cover as reading material the collected works of Allyn Young. 

After only a short browse through Mehrling's book on the collected works of 
Allyn Young I discovered a few interesting things related to MMT that I thought 
worth blogging about.

I wanted to write them down before finishing the lectures and book, 
to see if I get my mind changed (which is always the aim of all my study, 
exciting when it happens).
