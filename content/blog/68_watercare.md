This one is a template you could use to write to your local council. The 
issue concerns public water supply, but you could substitute *any* issue 
that involves a public utility.

The particular issue generating this template?

Auckland City Council bonds are being used to (fake) fund the water supply, 
run by a company *Watercare*. S&P threaten to downgrade the Council! (What a 
joke, the ratings agencies have no idea!) The NZ government cannot run out of 
money, so can always redeem any bonds, issued on behalf of the State, the 
RBNZ simply marks-down the bond holders Tsy (or Auck.C.C bond program) 
account, and mark-up the bond holders cheque account. The credit risk 
is _near_ **zero**. There is only a risk bond holders will not be redeemed 
if the politicians say they will not be redeemed.

Auckland rate-payers are going to be asked to pay higher rates, for no 
good purpose, for no need. Paying higher rates will 
not provide *Watercare* with any more real resources which the central 
government cannot immediately employ today without any rate hikes.

This "rate hikes" talk "is crazy. 

*[Watercare](https://www.watercare.co.nz/About-us/Who-we-are)* 
are Auckland Council owned and operated. They do not need to charge 
rate-payers for the services. Public water supply could easily be rationed 
using water-credits, redeemable for NZD denominated tax payments if you 
save them. The Smaller households can save and sell their water-credits to 
Bigger households and Firms at a mark-up from fair market price.

If *Watercare* cannot find enough employees to do the work, the government 
needs to tax those resources into unemployment in use in the private sector, 
and immediately employ them again in the public sector.


## Letter to Auckland City Council

... and all local councils and concerned citizens.

### The Funding for Municipal Water is not "tax dollars"

The funding is in terms of *tax credits* and these are issued by 
fiat --- by marking up bank accounts with a computer --- by the central 
government.

So-called "water costs" are always in *real terms* not monetary terms if 
the purchaser is the government or municipality via government budgeting. 
The government/council believe it is tax-payer funded, but it is not. The 
tax return is a redemption, not a pay-for (and helps limit some inflation 
impact in the case water supply capacity becomes scarce or under-resourced 
in *real terms*).

The *real cost* is the amount of workers and machinery resources etc 
employed by *Watercare* that is not then available to the private sector. 
The money is not an issue for the governments except because of false 
psychology. See the film 
*Finding the Money* <https://findingmoneyfilm.com/>.
 
### MMT Solutions

(Very "macro" picture here, we all know the votes in parliament are not 
available!)

A solution no neolibs will contemplate: stop selling bonds. They are not 
funding the public sector. They are pro-inflationary (given propensity of 
savers/resp. borrowers to spend/resp. save is equal) and serve an interest 
rate floor purpose. This policy is so incredibly stupid since the NZD is 
on a float. Government issues the currency first, from inception.

It is even worse issuing bonds: it amounts to little more than 
_basic income but only for people who already have money **in proportion to how much money they already have**._  This is because the _natural rate of interest_ with a currency on a float is **_zero_**.

All these public utilities are cases for government-pays, not user-pays, not 
bond-buyer pays. If the work done by *Watercare* is paid for at market price 
there is no inflationary impact, even if they are a private firm contracted 
by the State. The currency does not need to come from the "tax payer" or 
municipality rates. Those are redemption operations, not funding operations. 
Auck.C.C. is a branch of government, so they inherit fiat currency issuance 
capacity, provided central government marks-up the Auck.C.C. bank account.
