UBI is nuts. UBI is nuts. UBI is nuts...

Literally peanuts. Not good. Very bad.

Some things bear repeating _ad nauseam_ like a deliberate broken record.

Anything someone can contribute supported on a UBI morally deserves not 
a UBI pittance, but a decent living wage. Even Scott Santens simps agreed 
with this back in the Yang Gang days.  Therefore, hellno to ubi.

This said, why bother reading further? (Well, because UBI'ers are a stupid 
cult. So you may need more ammo)

"UBI-lite shows some benefits" --- yeah, so 𝒯ℱ what? So does killing nazis. 
Does not mean it is wise or just policy.

The Job Guarantee is the superior automatic stabilizer.  With a UBI we'd be 
supporting an unemployed labour buffer, which is stupid. Therefore, 
hellno to ubi.

The real things we should want a real goods, not a money fetish. Hence 
Universal Basic Services instead of ubi. This requires workers. 
So hellyeah to UBS, and hellno to ubi.

Do not undermine the workers. Hence hellno to ubi.

Allow the workers (by paying them fairly) to support the infirm, the young, 
the elderly and the distressed --- it creates rich (in spiritual terms) 
community --- with government support for labour. Hence, hellno to ubi.

"But, but, the job guarantee creates ꕗꖹꝆꝆꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs!"  --- no it does not 
you stupid ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗... well, unless the neoliberal ꕗ𖧳𖧥𖨚𖢧𖧥𖦪𖦧 is running the 
JG adminj! (Hellno to that.)  So again, with a caveat, hellno to ubi.

With a JG _you_ get to claim on the State, and contribute in whatever 
way you desire to your local community. This is all besides the 
nerdy countercyclical stabilization of the JG buffer. The ubi has not these benefits, hence hellno to ubi.

The UBI is the State's claim on other people's labour, so is regressive 
and hihgly unjust. Therefore, hellno to ubi.

"But, but, work is evil!" --- no it is not your cretin. No one works, we 
all die.  Therefore, hellno to ubi leaches.

"But, but UBi will help prop up capitalism with the needed income flow!" --- 
yes, therefore hellno to UBI.

"But, but UBI supports rents!" ---yes, therefore hellno to ubi (euthanize 
the rentiers).

"But the government is taxing us, they should give us the tax credits!" --- yes, 
therefore hellno to ubi!

(The purpose of the tax is to drive demand, so 
people will exchange goods or labour for the tax credit, it undermines the 
system if the government dishes out welfare to everyone who does not need 
welfare.) Hence again, double hellno to ubi.

Welfare is regressive ---- we have a welfare system because many people are 
infants or decrepit, and a decent civilized society means such people should 
not even be asked to work. So hellyes to a Basic Income Guarantee, and 
still hellno to ubi. (Tow completely different policies.)

The ubi does nothing to eliminate unnecessary welfare, the Job Guarantee 
does (if well designed, like not designed by utter cretins). We should presume 
policy does not metaphysically get designed by utter cretins. Hence, hellno 
to ubi.

On that last point, it is a good thing if a JG + BIG are the only policy 
in terms of non-public service, public investment, fiscal, since when the 
income is insufficient to sustain a decent living standard, you have the 
right gauge to adjust the JG + BIG (includes pensions) upwards.  Too many 
disparate welfare patchworks make policy adjustment a nightmare of fools 
competing on stupid preferences.  Get the government out of lifestyle 
preferences! --- that's not the government's role.

"But, but UBI gives people freedom!" --- no it does not _in the macro_ you 
stupid fools.  It is a nasty claim on someone else's labour (broken record). 
Usually some poor worker in the global south.

"But, but, under neoliberalism we actually _need_ a UBI?" --- yes, 
hence hellno to ubi.

Stop thinking so individualistically and selfishly you ubi simps. 
Do not accept _neoliberal realism_.

Wake up from your neoliberal zombie slumber. Decolonize your mind from 
money fetish.

TODO:
I've probably forgotten a dozen serious objections to ubi, 
and have hardly mentioned the benefits of a JG.
Add to this list as the lunacy dribbles in 
from econbrotube.
