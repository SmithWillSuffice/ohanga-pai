I will be writing the odd blog post over the next month commenting on highlights from 
Perry Mehrling's MOOC on [Money and Banking - online from INET](https://www.ineteconomics.org/education/courses/the-economics-of-money-banking).

I've been making the odd note about Mehrling's course. This week I'll comment on a 
few more segments from
[Lecture-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0IGZW0QOr4&list=PLmtuEaMvhDZYfVv95KDQWd8-7UrJCJ9Pm&index=5) 


## Money is Not Gold

Mehrling thinks gold is money, This is nuts.  He is terribly wrong, since a speck of 
gold dust is not a promise to redeem, nor a claim on anything. 

Of course you can argue semantics: "Well, I'm *defining* gold dust as a money thing' so 
suck it!"

This indeed might be faintly true if a government promised to accept gold dust in 
return for extinguishing tax liabilities, or someone else was promising t exchange 
gold for something. Has to be a promise though, otherwise it's not money of any kind 
any anthropologist or economics archaeologist has ever known.

Mehrling also thinks credit supply is limited (ultimately by gold I suppose). Idiot.

Credit is infinite. Banks are not constrained by gold, since they do not promise to 
redeem gold. They are constrained by their need to find legally (or illegally) 
credit-worthy borrowers. Governments are not even as constrained as that, they are 
constrained by *_all real resources_* not just gold. So a government cannot hire for 
$15/hour a worker already employed i the private sector for say $20/hour. Resource 
constraint. Gold is *_not_* money, that's an ancient Neanderthal view, although 
that's unfair to Neanderthals. An IOU promising gold is money.

## Caveat

**On Gold Being Not Money** the semantics matters I think. You can tell yourself gold 
is money, but why? Why the f? Why the f do you want to bind legal obligations to 
useless (except to engineers, queens and jewellers) metal people have to dig up out 
of the ground, only to then bury it inside another hole (Fort Know)?

Don't fetishize the stuff my dudes. Clean water, or the sparkling mineral waters, 
are far worthier of fetishizing. I'm also partial to carrots, beetroots and avocados.


### Bleeding Heart

At this stage my heart bleeds for every student of Mehrling's and the set of 
cardinality zero of my students who have to watch Perry's cringe. The problem being, 
Mehrling seems like a nice gentleman. Hard to hate him, and I don't. I love all 
sincere teachers.
