I've been making the odd note about [Mehrling's course](https://www.ineteconomics.org/education/courses/the-economics-of-money-banking). This week I'll comment on a 
few more segments from
[Lecture-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGkH0w9hpSQ&list=PLmtuEaMvhDZZyyAkEniNUMTTnlJj6qiKW&index=4) 


## Money is *Still* Not Gold

Just wanted to make a note that in this lecture it finally makes sense why 
Mehrling is obsessed with <span style="color: #ffff66;">gold</span>.

It is really the first time in the MOOC series  when gold becomes important. 
Domestically taxes always drive sufficient demand. For the Civil War it made 
sense that the North would grab the gold and use as an export to get imports. But 
even then, the gold is not the currency here, it's a commodity. The promise to 
pay is the currency, and that's never gold.
 
For gold coins it is not the metal that is the currency, it is the stamp of 
the issuer on it promising to be redeemed.
