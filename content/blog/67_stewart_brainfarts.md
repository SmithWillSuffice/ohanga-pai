John Stewart got the Ai productivity story wrong on 
[The Daily Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20TAkcy3aBY).

*Some* of the Ai bros get it half-right, but none of them understand the 
unemployment story. It is not about productivity.

## John Stewart = Cruel to Dogs

Both the Ai bros and Stewart were wrong  --- here is the biggest lie 
though @12:30 ---"upskill", "retrain",.... This misses the point entirely. 
Retrain for what? All of you, *_all of you_* need to know the source of 
unemployment. Then you can know how to eliminate unemployment. The source of 
all unemployment (defined as people seeking to exchnage their labour for 
the currency) is the government failing to hire all the unemployed Its tax 
liabilities _by design_ generated. The purpose of tax is to create people 
needing the state currency --- but *_for the purpose of hiring them in the public sector._* Understand this and "upskilling" or "retraining" is not the answer, 
the answer is the government just hires anyone who is willing to work for 
public purpose who cannot find employment in the private sector. 

Governments can *_always_* hire anyone who is unemployed, since *(a)* 
government issues the currency by fiat and does not get it off the tax payer, 
it's the other way around, tax payers get currency off the government net 
spending (or bank credit).  *(b)* the private sector bid for unemployed 
labour is zero, so this is not an inflationary pressure.

The private sector role is to produce real output with as few workers as 
possible, to free people to work for public purpose. We call this expanding 
the public sector, and should be in combination with a wage floor or 
Job Guarantee policy. No government is running a JG. They all could though. 
It is a policy choice. They don't because they do not understand the purpose 
of taxation.
      
Taxation is not a funding operation, it is an unemployment operation but by 
design, to create people willing to work in the public sector. So you hire 
them, *_All of them.* For people who cannot or should not be working the 
government provides Basic Income Guarantee (pensions, childcare, welfare).
      
The way governments currently use the tax system is cruel and does not fit 
broad public purpose. It's the cruel "Dog & Bone" story:  They are taxing 
Dogs 100 bones (issuing 100B in tax liabilities let's say), but only issuing 
90 bones (spending only 90B). The result is the entire economy is in default 
because governments are not hiring and spending enough, or fail to lower 
the tax liability (one or the other or both). It's even worse if a few elite 
Dogs (the Top Ten Percent) save a few billion a year, then there are even 
fewer "bones" for the rest who we call "unemployed in bones" (aka. unemployed 
in tax credits).
     
If you upskill and retrain the 10 Dogs who could not find bones, they might 
become expert bone finders, but next year all that'll happen is a different 
10 Dogs will come home boneless. You cannot solve unemployment using 
upskilling. You can only eliminate unemployment by hiring the unemployed ---
why not hire for public purpose? The skill does not matter. The purpose 
matters.
