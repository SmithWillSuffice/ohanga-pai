I still try to keep up with social media MMT spaces, but it is hard, since 
(a) I don‚Äôt have the time, and (b) it is a major stimulant for anxiety and 
depression. But I did manage to click the appropriate pixels on my browser 
page to see what Mike Norman had to say about the recent dis-inversion of 
the yield curve.  Below I‚Äôll attempt a mini synopsis, and finish with my take 
on the story. Let me emphasize: no one should bother paying any attention to 
me, especially not the ‚Äúpaying‚Äù. But if this amuses you, delights you, or 
motivates you to get into macroeconomic justice activism, then my job is 
well done. (This is not Millennial Gen false modesty and fake absurdist 
self-deprecation, it is just fact, since my expertise is in physics.)

Actually, I am going to invert this essay, and start with my take on the 
situation, then afterwards go through the terminology and the dynamics a bit.
(Non-technical, no math. Apologies to the nerds.) The challenge is to offer 
a decent honest "explainer" using only cartoons. This is an art, and I'm no 
Rembrandt at it, and my pencil is just words and letters, but I hope I find 
some appreciators.

## The Normanator

[Mike Norman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdiCqXjcNtI) 
puts out an 
[episode of his podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdiCqXjcNtI) 
claiming the Monetarists have it all backwards again. For all previous history 
they scream "murder" (or "recession") when the 
[bond market yield curve inverts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp) --- meaning short term 
yields on bonds go higher than long term yields. I will try to explain 
later the (false) logic why the 'Monetarists' (read: almost all mainstream 
economists) think an inverted yield curve signals a recession.

OK, but today, Mike notes, the Monetarists are changing their tune: now it 
is a dis-inverted yield curve that signals a recession. (MoneyTsarist: 
‚ÄúHaha! Psyche. We knew this all along, we were only kidding before, 
couldn‚Äôt you tell?‚Äù.  ü§£ ) 

((Ooops! Big linguistic pun error?  When you think about it, it is really 
the MMT extremist who is the ‚ÄúMoneyTsarist‚Äù.))

Mike then points out there was no recession after the yield curve inverted a 
few years ago, and there will be none. He then claims the yield curve 
dis-inverting (going back to "normal" with future yields higher than 
current yields) is also not a cause of a recession, but later on there might 
be a recession, say next year.
*_But_* it is _because_ the FED${}^\dagger$  votes as a committee to lower 
the interest rate that we get recession risk.

Thus, a dis-inverted yield curve in isolation means nothing, since the bond 
market is purely parasitic on the real economy, and serves as nothing but a 
regulator for interest-income to people who already have money.  It also 
helps tighten the torture apparatus screws on households who cannot avoid 
bank debt, but that's another story, because in one regressive trickle-down 
way or another the rich c\_nts have to get this income into the pockets of 
the middle class (at least) to keep up sales. Right. So if this trickle down 
fails and gets clogged up by neoliberal brain excretions in the pipes, then 
a recession is very likely. Sales dropping off is always the main damage. 
The spiral of lay-offs & hence declining sales leading to more lay-offs, then 
the epidemic-like nature of unemployment spreads like a nasty virus.

${}^\dagger$ "The FED": the US central bank, a branch of government 
with limited policy setting authority and regulatory authority. (Just had to 
state it, in case any libertarians are reading.)

Short story then: Mike was right. Or will be vindicated if things play out 
with interest rate cuts absent fiscal policy adjustments to keep demand 
steady.

As I inferred though, it is a double edged sword. The rich c\_nts lose 
interest-income, but so what? They already had money, and can still purchase 
whatever they need, just less of it, or the yacht that doesn't have the 
NSA/CIA GPS, only the NASA GPS. The poor get a lower debt burden, which is 
good, but not as high a wage growth with which to pay-off their past 
debt. The poorest always have past debt, that's why they are poor. 
Negative scorepoints.

There is also the initial impulse effect of asset revaluations whenever the 
interest rate changes sharply, but this is a transient effect. It causes 
market disruptions _both ways_ and so creates a perturbation in winners and 
losers, but the interest rate story is not what most people think it is, and 
the MMT alternative is to just have a permanent zero rate policy.
Private money lenders can be permitted within non-fraudulent reason, to charge 
a usury fee, but the MMT alternative is to employ workers so they do not 
need to borrow (except if they want to, e.g., buy a house).

This is a policy I have not heard about in the MMT literature too much, 
but Warren Mosler gets close to it, with the Job Guarantee. The idea is that 
a basic decent income is government guaranteed, and is _sufficient_ for any 
family to live with, inclusively, without stress, and that means it will 
always pay the rent, the electricity and the groceries, minimum, plus a bit 
to save for a vacation or whatever.

Why is it not _more prominent_ in the MMT literature? The answer is 
because the recovering neoliberal MMT'ers still fear the inflation bogeyman.  
_Keltonista:_ "Look, we cannot give the poor too many scorepoints, or they might 
eat too much and then we will get the horrors of inflaaaashhiooooon."

Right. Stomach inflation. Not so good.

If regularly adjusting the JG wage upwards causes a bit of inflation then it 
is a good thing. You should never fear or cry about inflation if this is the 
cause, it would be reactionary right-wing thinking and framing. You've just 
improved people's lives. _So friggin'  what_ if the general price level went 
upwards?, it is a gauge of the scorekeeping system that the policy to 
improve people's lives has just re-gauged.

Or as Bill Mitchell once put it, what do you prefer?  **(A)** the social 
pathologies of mass unemployment and wasted human lives, exceeding the costs 
of all wars in human history, or **(B)** the scorepoints inflating? 

(I suggest you prefer _not_ to be a proxy mass murderer.) 





## The Yield Curve

The conventional (so false) concept is that the yield curve charts the 
"cost to the government of borrowing". ü§£   A more stupid and regressive 
framing is not possible. It is completely backwards.

**First**, there is no cost to the government. The government matures all 
bonds by marking down a Treasuries account and marking up a check account.
There is no grandchild transported in from the future, nor any taxpayer 
involved. It literally cost $1$&nbsp;minute of a central bank clerk's 
labour time.

**Second**, the government cannot borrow Its own IOU, at least not if it desires 
a non-zero interest rate floor, because the over-night cash rate will head 
upwards if the reserve drain (selling bonds) is not offset by a reserve add 
(government spending). 

**Third**, the government does not _need_ to sell bonds. If the policy is 
zero interest rate floor, then the government can always spend and not sell 
bonds. Bonds are an interest rate maintenance account, not a funding account, 
and as a side-effect benefit _**only** people who already have money._

**Fourth**, if the government desired a positive interest rate (for whatever 
reason, but there are no reasons when on a floating exchange rate) then 
they might still set the _effective_ interest rate floor to zero but then 
tighten regulations on bank credit extension, say by restricting the policy 
on collateral regulatory requirements for issuance of those tax credits. 
Or increase the credit risk regulations. There are several other policy 
options I am sure to increase the "own price" of the currency (aka. the 
interest rate) in the secondary market.

I personally do not think such policies are necessary. The more stable option 
is to have your IOU trade at par, as the base case.  Let's try to eliminate 
usury, and let's face it, that is what it is when government chooses a 
positive interest rate, because although this privileges people who already 
have money, its also means chartered banks will increase their interest rate, 
since banks (who are not at risk of asset devaluations) are insensitive to the 
government's central bank rate, they always operate on a spread rate. (They 
are supposed to always be insensitive by regulations, but these are not 
well enforced, remember SVB bank!)

Another way to put this is that a floating exchange rate provides a 
government with greater fiscal policy space. It allows the central bank to 
set a permanent zero rate without psychological damage of nominal 
inflation.

**Fifth**, the zero rate policy is not "cheap money". It is money at par. 
"Cheap money" is the _higher_ interest rate, but it is only cheap money for 
people who already have money. In fact is is better than cheap, it is free.
Money for nothing except for "being rich". Bravo. let's reward you folks 
who have sucked up rents from the poor.

((I can fry my eggs in the sarcasm that drips from my keyboard.))

This is the thing about interest rates. They are not pure gauge, because they 
are asymmetric. For people who have money it is stimulus (albeit highly 
regressive, since it is all demand add for no supply add) and they do not need 
the money. For the poorest it is crippling, because they _need_ credit, just 
to eat.  It does not have to be this way.

The (non-zero) interest rate policy is thus a policy that generates 
_changes_ in winners and losers. The positive interest rate acts as a 
continual transfer from the poor to the rich, and in *_real terms_* (what 
your whole income can purchase).

**Sixth**, there are the other stories about other asset prices effected by 
changes in interest rate policy, but I do not need to write about all that, 
it is mostly a perturbation for the investment class, and only rich c\_unts 
exist in that class, and I have no moral obligation to go to bat for them, 
they all _should_ know the risks of living in a system with policy set 
(and regulations ignored) by worm-brain neoliberal politicians and 
central bankers. Governments should just pay pensioners a decent healthy 
basic income. Euthanize the "investment" class and money managers --- they 
are all parasitic overhead, a massive drain on the real economy.

By "investment class" I really _only_ mean the money managed accounts. 
Real investment in real industry is a good thing.

**Senventh**, why does the yield curve invert, then dis-invert. I've given 
you the answer, it is because the central bank votes to set the current 
interest rte floor. If they vote it up then new bonds will have higher yield.
That is the whole story.

Almost. If the central bank thinks there is too much economic activity for 
the good of those who like seeing workers suffer from unemployment, then they 
think it is appropriate to vote up the interest rate --- because they believe 
(falsely in most cases) this cools down the economy. (It doesn't.). It is a 
terrible policy response, but that is their thinking. That is why the yield 
curve can invert.

Conversely, if they fear a recession they vote to lower the interest rate, 
because they think this lowering of the cost of funds (aka. "cheap money") 
will help stimulate the economy. 
I just pointed out this latter idea ("cheap money") is false, it is the 
base case for trading the currency at par. It is the most stable. It is 
not "cheap money". It does not stimulate the economy in most cases. Especially 
not if the currency is on a float.  In any case, this vote will dis-invert a 
yield curve if it was previously inverted. Whether the feared recession ever 
happens is anyone's guess, but the backwards policy response is a sick 
self-fulfilling prophecy, the lower rates without any fiscal offset, like 
reducing taxes, will help _cause_ a recession (drop in sales --- for goods 
that people need that can easily be produced --- then the spiral).

I think I had a few more points to make concerning the Treasury bond market 
operations that relate to the Yield Curve story, but hopefully that is 
sufficient for now. If you have questions, or question my account, feel free 
to write to me. If you donate a few government scorepoints into my bank 
account via 
[KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/) then I might also write back and 
apologize if I got something wrong. Oh my goodness, am I selling 
Indulgences of some kind? LOL.


## Psychological Damages

I want to overlap with previous notes here at ≈åhanga Pai, and comment upon 
the reality that nominal inflation is not a financial nor economic risk, it 
is a psychological risk. It gets you voted out of office.

But there is another collateral damage. Because neoliberals do not understand 
the monetary system, _their policy responses_ to nominal inflation 
adjustments are almost always regressive. This is what hurts the poorest, 
not the inflation itself. It is always the inappropriate policy response. 
Hence my constant refrain to lefties:

>  Never fear the inflation bogeyman, it drives you towards regressive 
austerity polices. Do not do that! Instead make the appropriate policy 
adjustments by stuffing the pockets of the lowest wage workers with your 
scorepoints... but _only_ the lowest waged.

And I would add, do this until you just start to feel like the right-wing 
assassins are about to mobilize, but no more than that. 

I myself, if supreme leader, would go the whole hog and risk assassination. 
Just to prove a point.  The point that honest workers getting paid more 
are _never the problem_ --- unless they are the backwards thinking miscreants 
who turn fascist because someone even more Cretinous told them they 
should desire gold but cannot convert their scorepoints into certificates 
for gold bullion that is kept under the ground. (Is it a transgression to 
use the word Cretin these days?  I cannot keep up with these things.)

**Rich c_nts:** I know I should not cuss, you cannot help yourselves. But you 
understand why I do pity you so much: you do have a moral choice, unlike a 
starving household.  You can always choose to spend all your income.  A low 
wage worker cannot, they always spend all their income (which is a good 
thing for everyone else) but not because they choose.

**Preppers:** When you build your bunker for the end of the world scenario, is 
gold really going to be your main commodity of choice to steal?  What do you 
think the farmer who bakes your bread is going to ask in exchange for her 
bread? She is not going to waste burning energy carrying around
<font style="color: #ffd755;">gold bars</font>. 


### Apologies

Sorry again for no mathematics to back up the stories, and no 
actual _cartoon_ cartoons. If I can think of a good cartoon I will update 
this post.
How do you draw a central banker with the end of the yield curve in his 
hand like a skipping rope, and an investor trying to jump rope and the 
banker not cooperating? Probably better animated, but I have no time for 
that, or if I do it'll have to be xkcd style.
