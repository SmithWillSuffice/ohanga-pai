Even in Marx's day "value" in social in relative utility terms, or any subjective terms 
that emerges in a  society, was measured using the state's unit of account (dollars, 
pounds, marks, yuan, yen, pesos, &c.)

So when some economist talks about theories of surplus value they often reduce to 
nominal terms (the state currency unit) not real terms (energy and material).
But this is fine. As long as you know when it is appropriate to translate between real 
and nominal terms


## Philosophizing with a Hammer and Sickle

If I was really desperate to goof off, and was bored of physics or philosophy of 
consciousness, I might try one time picking up Jonas Ceika's book "How to Philosophize 
with a Hammer and Sickle" because it'd like to get a postmodernists perspective on 
Marx and Nietzche.

Nietzche fascinates me a little bit because he was a crap philosopher, but highly 
esteemed, and highly despised. You know you've done at least one thing right when you 
create enemies on all sides. But what exactly did Nietzche get right that pissed off 
so many and led to high esteem in the eyes of others?

To put a blunt point on it, I'd say it was introducing (or rather emphasising) the 
study of raw unapologetic power into social philosophy.

OK. Good job. Vital. No wonder postmodernists eat it up --- postmodernism largely 
eschewed Marx and turned to titillating each other with academic conferences about 
power relations. This is critical theory, and a large block of postmodernism.

But this is not the topic to hand.

I mention Ceika because I decided to take the lazy man's way today and while looking 
for the pixie sleepy dust I turned on a channel 
[@AWorldToWin](https://www.youtube.com/@AWorldtoWin) hosted by Melody, which had a 
review of Ceika's book. The review runs into the "younger Marx" (idealist) and the "older 
Marx" (political economist). That provoked a comment, so I wrote one, and will repeat 
here with embellishments.

Although, truth be told, instead of counting sheep I was at first listening to 
[1Dime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmMJbwE8j98) 
 who does terrific MMT explainer videos, and he had 
[interviewed Melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pax-zns-RnI&list=PLyytc2-LIrN76QbCkj4Y6w65OAgpyIuRg).

((While doing acknowledgments here, I got a lot out of Steve Keen's writings on 
Marx and the bogus labour theory of value.))

## Labour Theory of Value is False (by a long way)

Melody points out a critique of Marx by Louis Althusser (1918-1990) an old white dude 
philosopher, who pointed out this "epistemic break" in Karl Marx from the younger 
(Hegelian) to the older (materialist).

I found this fascinating, because from reading Marx and following a few scholars who 
understand the economics content in both the 
[Grundrisse](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/) and 
[Capital](https://libcom.org/article/capital-karl-marx), I was able to, thanks to 
Althusser (via Melody) pull out a splinter in my mind that had bugged me.

This is the little puzzle of why in the Grudrisse Marx figured out the source of 
surplus value in production, knew it was not all labour, but then reversed to 
deliberately falsify himself in Capital.
He tried to find human labour as the sole source of surplus value in Capital, 
but failed in the Grundrisse. He found a weaselly way to twist his logic to argue for 
the Labour Theory of Value (LTV) in Capital, and presented it. 

I mean, I understood his motive: you tell the noble lie.
He wanted to scientifically (which means unscientifically in this context) "prove" 
capitalism was self-destructive.

Why? Because he wanted to "scientifically" motivate fervour for socialism.

But noble lies like this are still lies, and can lead to no good (in my humble 
opinion, not based on stupid petty moralisms, but empirically, and spiritually --- in 
spiritual terms, one big lie, even if noble, discloses a tainted heart).
Not that I condemn Marx, I do not know the guy. Marx had good reason to want to 
suppress his emotions about the horrors going on in his Dickensian times. He'd be 
inhuman not to be touched by the plight of the poor and working class in general. But 
instead of appealing correctly to spiritual impulses, as the younger idealistic Karl 
might have done, he (perhaps?) thought he'd grown up and so had to use "science" 
--- like an 18th Century but socialist Ben Shapiro (try to forget I wrote that, 
I couldn't resist).
So, yeah. Who the hell am I to condemn a noble lie.

But me, today, I could never take a time machine go back and witness industrial 
worker horrors and defile science to motivate  socialist revolution, no matter how 
much I'd want a revolution. My approach is that truth matters, and is more powerful 
than the noble lie.

Now, of course, I cannot say Marx was guilty of falsification. He wrote both volumes, 
so must have been aware of the problem. I think he just tried to suppress his logic 
and present a near-enough good argument for LTV. But in logic "near enough" has no 
meaning ("near" is a topological concept, and "enough" is subjective), and in fact 
Marx got it wrong in Capital. As any scientist today would tell you.

The physical inputs into production are energy, machinery, and skilled labour. (you 
might count others, but these are the big three). Marx can argue that machinery was 
always built using past labour. So the LTV holds good so far. But not all energy (and 
mass) is created by the hands of humans. And not by several orders of magnitudes (as 
inputs 
into production). So the LTV is ridiculously false.

But in Marx's day, no economists understood what energy was. None of them understood 
thermodynamics or basic physics. So you could, perhaps, forgive them this error? 

In fact to this very day, several strains of sockcuckery economics (the bullsh*tters 
--- the Neoclassicals, Austrians and New Keynesians, even some post-Keynesians) 
totally ignore the role of energy in production. Energy does not factor into their 
models except as just one more commodity market like any other. They "give-away" 
that they do not understand is if you ask them about constraints at the macroeconomic level. If they dare say "run out of other people's money" you know they're scientifically illiterate. The contraints are real resources, and maximally that's available free mass-energy ("free" here in the thermodynamicists sense, not the financial sense, free energy = [exergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergy)).

((Yet the French Physiocrats, not the nicest guys, did understand the role of energy in production. A pity they were not humanistically inclined. It could have aided the socialist cause had they been talking with Marx and Engels.))

### Crystallized Labour

People have attempted to refute Steve Keen's analysis of the contradiction or switch 
that went on from the Grundrisse to Capital, but none I know of have anything good to 
say about it, and nor should they feel the need. You should not descend into 
mysticism by claiming: <span style="color: lightblue;">
"It is the crystallized labor${}^\dagger$ contained in a commodity that provides it 
with its objective value.</span>" which 
[one critic](https://mmaluff.com/2012/11/02/in-defense-of-the-labor-theory-of-value/) of 
Keen's did.

That's because there is a far simpler case that Marx was morally correct for all 
damn time, and his correctness had nothing to do with the LTV, and everything to do 
with the ideals of justice.

<span style="color: lightblue;">${}^\dagger$</span> You should be asking what 
exactly do pseudo-materialist marxists mean by 'congealed" or "crystallized" labour? 
If they give you an account absent the role of energy you know they are either 
self-deluded (so the religious type of marxist) or fibbing. They sure as heck are not 
honest materialists. But being materialists is perhaps the root of their problem. In 
this they share more in common with neoliberals than with myself. They need to 
fabricate the pseudo-scientific argument in Capital because they do not permit 
themselves the spiritual. I find that awfully tragic.

The comment I eventually left on the youtube clip was:

> another trouble with the "older Marx" was he was anti-scientific but thought he was 
scientific. He showed why LTV is false in the Grundrisse, but then in Capital tried 
to weasel his way out of it to be able to derive the FLP. Total failure. You know a 
logically illiterate marxist zealot by whether they still believe the LTV and FRP. 
The "younger Marx" had it all right - labour is not the sole source of surplus value, 
but *that does not matter* because _labour is the **only socially exploited** source of 
surplus value_. So capitalism (qua Marx) is morally and ethically plain wrong, 
completely regardless of what the source of surplus value in production happens to be 
(it's the Sun and soil, air and sea, for the most part, we get that "for free" 
without social exploitation, until the rentiers arrive on the scene).

Couldn't get too much more succinct.

I guess I could have written it not to take such a pot shot at marxist zealots. But to 
my mind this sort of criticism matters.


## Bosonized Revolutions

Any wannabe revolutionary today had better understand power relations (the one thing 
Nietzche hit a decent nerve with, even if for warped reasons and messed up directions). 
There economics thinking is stuck back in the ignorant past with gold standard 
"commodity currency" thinking, or at best updated to New Keynesians fixed exchange rate 
brainworm mentality.

In fundamental physics the force carriers are the bosons (characterized by not 
obeying Pauli exclusion). What are they in political revolutions? Could it be 
whatever underlies and buttresses solidarity?

Nietzche got power relations upside-down though. He rejected spirituality and 
religion, but these are historically, and today, the single most powerful forces in 
society. You know this because when they are abused they become anti-religions and 
anti-spiritual  (christian fanaticism, New Age grifts, cult worship, Hindu and 
Buddhist separatism, Islamic militancy, &c., all are anti-religions) and yet retain 
residual powerful force (for 
harm). To combat this harm the greater power is spiritual --- honesty, kindness, 
compassion, love, truth and wisdom --- these are always more powerful than guns 
and swords. Castro knew this. He did not establish peace in Cuba at the point of 
a spear, he defended his people with the guns, he did not tame them with guns.

It's not that you need to grok MMT to be a better revolutionary (but it would not 
hurt) but that you need spiritual weapons to fight the modern class war. Material 
weapons will not overthrow neoliberalism. There is no falling rate of profit. There 
is no direct force of historical materialism inevitably leading to the 
collapse of neoliberalism.

If you want to defeat neoliberals, you will be either waiting for massive catastrophe 
like climate or ecological damages, accompanied by violence from the green fascists, 
*_or_* you'll be teaching people who are honest and decent and humble that 
neoliberalism is evil and cannot be tolerated, and we have no need to wait for nature 
to tell us this is so. We all have agency. We only lack solidarity.
