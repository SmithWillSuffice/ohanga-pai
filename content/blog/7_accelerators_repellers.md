This is one in possibly a series of posts for the general audience on some of the 
dynamical systems ideas underlying macroeconomics. Our focus is on macro and 
mesoeconomics. So we are **_not_** interested in particular stock prices, or even 
sectors, we are interested in the main aggregated market indices 
(in the USA the SPX, NASDAQ and whatever). This is partly pragmatic. 
If you liken the economic system to the weather and climate, the climate is very 
predictable (highly macro) the weather is not (too micro).

Whenever you see such qualitative level distinctions, you know you are dealing with a 
dynamical system with so-called *emergent* properties, and top-down causations. A 
purely bottom-up system that admits a reductionistic description can always be 
modelled using micro-casual analysis --- with enough compute power. A genuine 
top-down controlled system does not admit such analysis. But most dynamical systems 
are not entirely top-down. And the economy of a large nation is such a hybrid system, 
it has micro-causal and macro-causal responses and feedbacks, so also involves 
potential for useful mesoscopic analysis.

((For the philosophers: genuine top-down causation is impossible in classical physics, and so is considered impossible in economics, because the economic system is considered to not be sensitive to quantum mechanics. But this is incredibly naïve and foolish. There is a stupid dumb way you can see it is foolish at a very basic level, because all the computers running the modern fintec systems and nanosecond trading algorithms absolutely must rely upon quantum mechanics, because their transistors cannot function otherwise. But this is stupid because the transistors are a mere means to a classical end. The computation on the trader's desktop is a Turing machine process, even sub-Turing because it lacks an infinite memory tape. So all *that* is totally classical physics input into the economic system.))

((So where is the top-down in economics? You do not have to believe Roger Penrose to 
think quantum mechanics pays a role in human thinking processes, but you should 
understand human consciousness is not explained by physics (the inner subjective 
phenomenal qualia). So no matter what the source of human consciousness is (we do not 
really care for present purposes) whatever it is, it is not physics. So human 
psychology is not driven by bottom-up blind physical events. You will need to read my 
other website ([T4G theory,](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/) to see one set of reasons 
why, or just trust me. Human beings making good and bad, lame and chad, decisions are 
top-down influences on economics, with bottom-up signals as other inputs.)


## Generalized Forces

One question one might naïvely ask is "What are the generalized forces in an economic 
system that *move* prices?"

The six billion dollar question. Most analysts give up, and use brute raw statistical 
probability theory analysis, which is admitting you have no idea about the forces.
You only know distributions of outcomes. Which I think is a fair approach, even with 
state-of-the-art dynamical systems models and ANN (artificial neural networks).

The thing is, no dynamical system model can do a better prediction or modelling job 
than the accuracy of your modelling assumptions permits. And no ANN can do a better 
prediction of modelling job that the data it gets trained on can admit.
