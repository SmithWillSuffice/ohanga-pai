There is a nice Spaghetti Leftist Trilogy from Richard Murphy. 
I will add just a few margin comments for the record. Please do check out his monologues for yourself and for reference, they are good.

## Comments on the Trump Bubble

Arguably the Trump Bubble has already burst, and we are suffering the flood 
of fascism spilling out. It will pass. The Ai bubble? Hardly. You cannot stop 
a nerd from believing a program emitting strings that read well are conscious. 
But unlike radical reich-wing political movements, the computer nerds are not 
causing any harm. It is the right-wing NerdReich techno-fascists who control 
the computer tech who can cause harm.

Please do not mistake this for a US 2nd Amendments thing, “Guns do not 
kill, people do.” --- It’s not the same by any stretch. An LLM or CNN/rNN is 
not designed to kill. That makes all the difference. (Jason Bourne can kill 
with a roll of newspaper or a sharpie pen, so let’s ban those.)

I was not so sure The Murph has the correct analysis of the DJT era.

It's quite what you he makes out. In my view, I suspect no one really cares 
about DJT "delivering results," except a few saps in the fake-populist petty 
bourgeoisie. 

A deeper analysis has to look at things like Citizens United, 
and the deeply unholy 'deep state' alliances between the (anti)Christian far 
right and Zionists, and Oligarchs, the modern unholy Trinity. In their 
worldview DJT has delivered results, no more-so evident than SCOTUS. It's good 
for them DJT can be a fall-guy. DJT himself doesn't seem to care (he's not 
even a  turd blossom), provided he gets a few more million US tax credits in 
his bank account. After DJT there'll just be another reactionary fake populist. 
It's a lot like the crypto bubble. It can be sustained in perpetuity because 
those really pulling the strings are isolated and inoculated from the 
political and economic fall-out. Meaning if we actually want neocon 
reich-wing politics to crash out, we have to actively work hard to make it 
happen, and seeing the grave of DJT is not the way.

Genuine honest, sincere Christians would never vote for DJT, and would never 
use him for their Machiavellian purposes, and would never seek to repeal 
Roe vs Wade in the first place (the _casus belli_ for Citizens United).
(See the documentary, _The Dark Money Game_ to witness how a sincere 
Christian turned against DJT and CU, after initially swallowing the 
reich-wing koolaid of the prosperity gospel.)

Richard also mentions something about "𝖕𝖆𝖎𝖓" being involved in these 
'collapses'.  I thought Jeff Rich at _The Burning Archive_ had a better take 
on "collapse" youtubers. (They're real influencers, fake educators).

I wrote to Murph:

> [@6:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNTnh32nvGQ&t=360s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH)
no pain needs to be involved. At least nto for good people. The government is 
not beholden to "financial markets". Nor are farmers, carpenters, and other 
crafts-people and artisans. The financial markets are dependent on government. 
So you had that backwards. If financial markets collapse that's a very good 
thing, it frees up otherwise parasitic labour for other purposes. Those 
Wall St Quants can no be hired by the State to teach the history of their now 
eliminated and predatory former profession to kids in schools. Lest the kids 
ever forget.


## Comments on the Ai/Crypto Bubble

The crypto bubble cannot burst of its own accord. It is a new type of suport 
for Black Markets. The way to get rid of it all is to legalize the 
black market goods.
But who the devil wants to legalize assassins for Hire and assault weapons 
trde?

Some things are illegal for a reason.

I can understand regulating recreational drugs. It makes a more peaceful 
subculture, young rich kids no longer supporting South American and 
Asian murder cartels.  But some drugs should not be legal.

In a liberal democracy or social democracy, I think we have to tolerate 
the propensity of some people to do ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ things.  We do not have to 
encourage and endorse them!  If a King or Emperor tries too regulate all 
behaviour under the pretense of "protecting the common good" then I call 
that a spiritual death. It's not living. You are not truly alive if you have 
no capacity for turning ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ thoughts into ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ deeds.  The whole point 
of spiritual growth is to learn to have betetr thoughts, as well as better 
deeds, the latter will follwo from the former. If you have no such capacity 
your are either dead, or a robot.

In related reporting, [The Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2s8I6yBrxE)
(hardly a raging legftie) had a monologue on the 
[study shwoing a small number of bad samples can poison LLM’s of any size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192).

Sure. If the thing was conscious can you imagine you can poison it with a 
little bit of FoxNews? \[Rhetorical question yo.\]


Hey, I'm not gong to make any Oracle pronouncements. The Murph could be 
correct than one of these tech bubbles could 𝐜𝓸𝖑𝓵𝓪𝕡𝔰𝓮 soon.  I'm just saying I 
do not see why.  There are supports direct from government that prop such 
scams up. In the case of Ai it's failure to enforce anti-trust, failure to 
protect consumers, and direct government fiscal support for the tech-bro 
oligarchs.  For Crypto it is austerity, for want of a better catch-all. 
Government austerity is what drives demand for ponzi "get rich quick" schemes. 
But also the existence of black markets too, and the imposed "need" for 
tax havens or in the case of Crypto just escape from tax altogether.
 
It is a stretch to claim (needless) government fiscal austerity promotes 
Crypto, it's a lot more complicated. But I'll stick to that as a minor 
claim. It's not _all_ wrong. 

((For MMT n00bs: "fiscal austerity" can be simplified to taxing more than 
they spend. K̐̈I̐̈S̐̈S̐̈. Although that K̐̈I̐̈S̐̈S̐̈ is a bit gross, since it doesn't 
distinguish military Keynesianism from decent things like full employment, 
via expanded universal public services and a Job Guarantee. So one should 
also both K̐̈I̐̈S̐̈S̐̈ and T͛E͛L͛L͛.))

If government taxed real estate instead of incomes, especially taxing to the 
high hilt non-owner occupied housing, then a lot of tax evasion disappears.
And all the other typical MMT informed fiscal policies, and eliminating of 
monetarist policy, goes a long way to deep sixing the parasitic finance 
sector, and along with it probably a lot of Crypto. 

In any case, who cares? Not I for one. Crypto is a kind of cordoned off other 
world. It recycles winners and losers, like a Casino. You can avoid most of 
the rot by just not gambling. Do not participate!

Same for drug wars. Just don't take drugs, then the drug lords go away.
I know, easier said than done in some cases Too many Banksie _The Culture_ 
wannabe acid communists.  But for Crypto, it's a lot easier to not participate.

I admit there is some leakage of crud into ordinary people's lives, since a 
bit of continued government austerity can be immorally justified by 
neoliberals appealing to crypto, although goodness knows why epopel fall for 
it still. You know what I mean --- **KingNeolib:** _"We're deregulating it all, so people have the freedom to get rich quick and all that... so just say 'thank you' you miserable plebs."_

((Lord forgive them, they might not know what they do.))


## Comments on the Neolib Bubble

Onyl really had minor objections to some language framing. But IU think they
are important.

The Murph argues that a fair economy will balance or focus on Moral Purpose, 
not "balance the books".

> This is a beautiful monologue. Everything good I can endorse. Please run 
for PM? 🤣  However @7:00 it's not about "balance the books" — that's false 
rhetoric and false framing, so do not frame it that way.  The books 
are _always in balance_ or some accountant made a mistake and has to fix it. 
We already run MMT systems. The correct reich-wing framing is that they 
want *fiscal flows* in–out of Gov to net to zero.  Totally different to 
"balancing the books".

He mentioned that we can design an economy that gorws wages, not just empty 
statements about growing GDP".  I wrote,

> @5:14 no, no no, — _no_ to "growing wages".  Yes to "growing **real** wages". 
It's not about the nominal wage nor inflation (a fake boogeyman) it is about 
the real goods your whole income can purchase, not what $1 can purchase.
A follow-up:

> Inflation is neither good nor bad, it all depends on how it was generated. 
It can be good by design  — increase the floor wage with a Job Guarantee 
continual upwards adjustment. This achieves what all _soi dissant_ lefties say 
they want — a wealth tax on hoarded tax credits.  Are they prepared to back 
it for real then, even if it is "too easy" being by de facto ?  Or are they 
all going to become right wing Thatcherites again and cry about inflation? 
(Again, since as they do by spewing "me tax dollars paid for it..." 
Thatcherite nonsense.)

It's again a vital distinction. Who the hell cares if their wage is rising if 
the price is rising faster? Who the heck cares if their wage is falling if 
prices are falling faster? 

Yeah, I recognize people care!  They're all fools. What can I tell ya'?
I'm just here to promote true knowledge, nto false psychology. But my all 
means, if you think it serves justice then continue to spew lies.

In my corner of spiritual geekdom, a lie is never going to lead to justice. 
There is some sort of metaphorical principle behind that, no doubt wrapped up 
in why and how we are conscious sentient Beings. But that's a whole different 
blog site.  **Spiritual econmics** is what Richard Murphy preaches, and it is 
good. All it means is promoting and acting for love, compassion, kindness, 
honesty, wisdom and justice... and yes, mercy even for the "wicked" (a 
relative concept, glass houses, stones, and all that).

Richard is one of the few MMT'ers I know who promote spiritual economics, 
and that's what Ōhanga Pai was supposed to be about. You have to however take 
some syntactic turpentine, isopropal, waterjet, &c., to cleanse my blogs of 
the cusswords to reveal the gems.  Richard is more straight-up and boring, 
the Monty Chartered Accountant of Dirtbag spiritual MMT. It's a good thing.
