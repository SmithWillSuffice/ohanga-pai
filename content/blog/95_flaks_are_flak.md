Came across this interesting lecture by 
[Naomi Oreskes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=809JOIQ2W2o).

> Scientists have to do an enormous amount of work to stabilize _claims_ as 
accepted _facts_. 

When one does not do the work then one is less a scientist, more a propagandist.

This speaks to climate change denialism, and all the rest: 
vaccine effectiveness deniers, but I would say:

... and yet it goes both ways. How many so-called "scientists" deny the 
reality of the _spiritual_. The answer, I bet, is, "heaps of them."

Science is a good way too stabilize claims as fact. But there are other 
methods too. Since cannot stabilize metaphysical claims, Science can only 
stabilize physical claims. At least i am not aware of any proper science worth 
the name that studies non-physical claims. Maybe cosmology comes close, but 
few reputable cosmologists stray beyond the bounds of physicalism.
If they do, they cease "doing science" and are indulging in pure philosophy. 
Not that i am opposed to the effort. 

The scientist who only "does science" is only half a human.

You might be guessing what this essay is all about. I think I wanted to 
steer towards anti-science fake-populism.

I always regard populism as a good thing, and science --- good science --- is 
still pretty darn popular, and universally so, on all sides of the 
political spectrum.

It is only a weird fringe crowd who are overtly anti-science.  Unfortunately 
they often have the loudest most obnoxious voices, and the news media plays it 
up and amplifies. You know exactly why!

But scratch the surface and I think you find these science deniers are 
really only anti-corporations. And I think also only really 
anti corrupt corporations.  We can debate whether a corporation is 
by mere existence, by definition, intrinsically corrupt. I tend to think not. 
But that is a debate for another time.  A corporation is just a piece of paper. 
It cannot be corrupt. What people with souls do with such papers is what 
is corrupt.

By "Science" the anti-science crowd tend to mean "Big Science", as in 
"Big Pharma" and "Big Oil".  

Or at least, that is what I try to say to myself to console my depression 
& never-ending anxiety.

Even Sabina Hossenfelder is a little anti-science 
in her protestations again "tax payer funded"ðŸ¤£ 
large particle collider projects. 

As for Oreskes, she has walked clear eyed into 
a [few controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes#Controversies).
And I would say her record is pretty clean.

People advocating more nuclear power as necessary step to avoid 
catastrophic climate change are simply nuts. Maybe they are right. But also 
maybe not. My point would be, you cannot know the future. All sorts of 
things could happen, like politicians actually thinking MMT is the 
monetary system they're already governing. Who know where _that_ could end, 
huh?

It's not like finally knowing the actual rules of the game being played does 
anyone playing honestly any harm?

What is for certain is that a combination of more renewable energy supplies 
and cutting back on energy rate (power) usage can achieve the global limits 
we should desire. Working within the 
[Planetary Doughnut Boundary](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/).

I think this case for eneergy conservation and cut-back is not even 
controversial. But the econoists think they need endless growth to support 
the creidt money economy, i.e., never-ending profits. This is a false 
conception based ona  fasle understanding of the State currency system.

Once MMT removes those veils, we realize no one need be starved of currency 
just in order to limit energy output rate over time.

The energy output rate story can be decoupled from the currency austerity 
story, but only if one comprehends the MMT system. Governments can never 
run out of their own tax credit. End of that side of the story.

Then you can focus on the real side of the story which is, 

> _do we really need all this production of total crap?_


No we do not.

Peaceful, calm, prosperous, spiritually rich, materially unimpoverished, 
low energy use civilization ensues.

Without this education though, mindless profit seeking production of total 
crap will ensue, until ecological systems break.


## The AI Hype

One of my GoAT candidates, Kurt GÃ¶del, knew the **P=NP?** problem before it 
had the name. He wrote to John von Neumann that should it be possible to 
reduce theorem discovery to a polynomial time algorithm then human 
mathematicians would be become largely redundant... except for...

Well, can you guess?

GÃ¶del's point is that human mathematicians could get very lazy, since a 
modern computer can easily check theorems of enormous complexity, well 
beyond what we can write down on paper. The problem is, if the theorem 
discovery is exponential or worse in the problem size, then even the fastest 
computer will be unable to prove most true theorems in a time less than say 
the age of the present universe.

(The time it would take for most true theorems would be far longer than 
even this. Even if we converted the whole universe into a giant computer.)
