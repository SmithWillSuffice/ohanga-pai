[Real Progressives](https://realprogressives.substack.com/p/brick-by-brics?source=queue) had another round of discussion about BRICS and the 
SWIFT system, SDR's and other related issues of international currencies.
While the purpose is good, I think a few things are worth noting, and I will 
be mainly making a critique from a dirtbag leftie perspective. Some folks who 
like the concept of BRICS might not appreciate this, but I hope you read 
this and offer corrections if you think any are needed.

**Short synopsis:**  

1. It does not matter what currency a government is forced to pay in, 
since there is always a forex rate, even for some of the poorest nations. 
The issue is how to make the swap to make the payment, not the 
currency unit.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seller, generally a private sector agent motivated to sell, will most often make that exchange. 
2. The issue is the fear of inflation — but when has a payment forced in 
USD ever been inflationary? I can't see the mechanism for inflation only 
because USD units are being demanded.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numeraires don't cause anything. 
3. In any case, if exports are not strong then inflation can get passed 
through if more imports are desired and the government supports more 
imports at an increasing rate. It is the rate of increase in this case 
(or import price hikes) that mostly effects inflation. But in this 
case the imported inflation is not the weaponization of the dollar, but 
your weak economy demanding more than it can itself supply.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This falls under the heading 
of **_Deficiency of non resident savings desires_** (if one were to be writing a FED briefing. lol)
4. The USA can weaponize payments layers in many ways, it is through the 
transport layer, not the currency unit, e.g., by refusing payments, 
imposing preferential prices/penalties, blockades, etc. That's the actual 
weaponization occurring. That's the proper case to make for say a BRICS 
_transport_ system$^{}ddaggaer$, but you'll need a lot more than BRICS units. 
Proper UN trade facilitation and dismantling and reforming the WTO to be 
not a neoliberal attack dog.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_However_** the US would have to interfere 
with payments between others for the BRICS payments to be a benefit. This is only 
significant for currency-users, not currency-issuers. So the USA really have 
no power at all through payments layers to cripple any nation, they don't 
need to do it that way. Nations get crippled by USA "dollar hegemony" 
only because they do not understand the power & purpose of their 
_own_ existing currencies.
5. Ultimately a seller of US goods with a US bank account will receive USD, 
but you cannot call this weaponization! It is called "desiring a US bank account".
6. You say, "But what about pass through inflation?" OK, but when has that 
ever crippled a nation? It's all fear mongering. The source of inflation to 
worry about is _not_ coming from the payments layer. It comes from greed 
and corruption, which BRICS is not going to fix. 

BRICS will help in moving where and who the more corrupt oligarchs live and 
exploit. It might be a _very good thing_ for the USA (absent active 
lefties in the BRICS nations).

MMT is only a lens for all this analysis. The true solutions to the 
oppression of the working class are spiritual. By which I only mean 
compassion, solidarity, honesty, trustworthiness, wisdom. Armed with 
these spiritual tools the working class can advance and defeat oligarchy. 
MMT adds to the critical Knowledge component of Wisdom.

$^{}ddagger$Did someone just say "One Belt One Road"?

## For the Global South the Problem is not the Payments Layer

This reminded me of when years ago some MMT activist wanted privacy 
respecting payments systems. I told him the means already exist, such 
as the 
[GNU Taler](https://taler.net/) software (for online payments only for now, 
but that's not a huge downside). Full buyer anonymity${}^\dagger$. The 
seller is however not private. This is by design, so they don't escape 
the NIPA accounting.

"But we have to protect anonymity of exploited workers like 
prostitutes...," came the cry.

**Wrong!** We have to protect _all_ workers, and sex workers should not be 
even worrying about the payments layer they use. The protection of _all_ 
workers is not through the payment layer. 

Also, I do not see any sex workers organizing underground movements to 
overthrow the oligarchs. But if they are, then great! But the payments 
layer they use for work is neither here nor there.

You know, this strain in MMT circles is really just the same old colonization 
of people's minds that the Austrian Schoolers and goldbugs have. Investing 
far too much hope (for their ideological values) in currency systems.

It is the same with the UBI crowd. Giant mind worms. Appeasing people 
with scorepoints they did not have to earn is fools gold. The 
[parallel currency folks](http://www.chiemgauer.info/) are doing things 
infinitely better --- they understand the _purpose_ of the tax-driven 
currency system running on top. (Mini lesson: it is to deliberately create 
unemployment, so the state can then get rid of the unemployment.) 
As long as the State fails to fill the unemployment gap (same as spending 
gap), a local parallel currency can always be successful in eliminating 
local unemployment, with zero inflation pressure.

What MMT is very good at is clarifying one's perspective, so that 
the monetary system of accounts is the least of our concerns.
It removes the bad Marxist cobwebs of "the commodity form" which was 
always brain rot. This allows what is brilliant about Marxism to 
shine brighter.

${}^\dagger$ (Up to NSA level belligerence in brute force reverse 
engineering the flows of funds & goods to infer buyer identity. But no 
currency can protect you from that spy craft.)


### Do foreigners get forced to pay for goods in dollars? 

**Answer:** No. 

**Comment (a).** It is a fundamental misunderstanding of monetary systems 
to think the USA can force anyone to pay in US dollars, meaning need to 
get US dollar scorepoints into their bank account first. While there is a 
fee, international payments systems --- mainly forex desks or dealer banks 
or platforms like Western Union and other --- allow you to pay for goods 
sold in USD with your scorepoints in your bank account.

But  even this misses the point. The dollar is just a numeraire. Anyone will 
accept your currency for payment. The issue is how much you must give them 
above the fair exchange rate. If you are in the black markets or dealing with 
a real piece of sh1t monopolist, they might demand more than the fair 
exchange rate.

Back in the old days when you travelled it was always handy to have a few 
USD bills in your wallet, since everyone accepted them. But how the hell 
did you get those greenbacks? Goodness knows... right? You musta' run a 
counterfeit press.  "Ye godz! Dollar hegemony!" 

As I say, still goldbugs colonizing your minds. Even some MMT'ers who 
should know better.

**Comment (b).** Too many lefties are placing hope in freedom from the 
"US controlled" payments systems and "US dollar hegemony". Both these 
are myth-making, which while not directly lacking class conscious 
nevertheless seem on that verge.


### Do governments get forced to pay for goods in dollars? 

**Answer:** No. 

They can always pay in their domestic currency. What seller is going to 
refuse the sale?

If the purpose was to simply prevent a poor nation from getting the goods, 
that does not require some evil government control of the SWIFT system 
or anything else like it. The exporters just get told to not ship. No 
payments layer is in sight.

To think it is the payments system or the currency numeraire is to have 
a colonized goldbug mindset. MMT should free you from this. 

However, I cannot stop governments from being stupid and self-imposing 
dollar hegemmony on their people. They do so all the time. They should be 
corralled by the worker party and ridiculed and taunted to death with 
the Monty Python joke weapon.


## A Kiwi Lesson

Little New Zealand told the US nuclear powered vessels to find somewhere 
else to dump their waste. A few threats were promised. Nothing bad happened.
Sure, New Zealand has no oil or lithium etc., so we're lucky.  But that's a 
parochial perspective. Whatever shaky foundations the United Nations was 
laid upon, the collective nations of the world do not have to sit back idly 
while poor mineral rich countries continue being exploited. Even then, 
where does the exploitation arise from? It is _not_ from the USA all alone, 
it's from corruption of the leaders of those poor nations. They're greedy. 
BRICS will not stop them being greedy for scorepoints --- it does not have 
to be USD accounts. Sorry it is so banal. 

Don't write to me complaining I don't understand Realpolitik please. Any 
powerful nation can exploit the weak, and it has nothing to do with needing 
to control the payments layer. If you think it is, and you think BRICS is a 
partial remedy, I think you are the more naïve. Like any tool controlled by 
the elites, BRICS can be used for good or for bad. But it is the wrong place 
to place your hopes.

You need to place your hopes in what you can control.

I can't control what word spew Jeffrey Sachs, Richard Wolff, 
Yanis Varoufakis, and Michael Hudson emit, though I can hope their hearts 
are in the right place. 

What _can_ a dirtbag leftie control?

We can control who we associate and organize with, and what we do off work 
hours to organize (and how much time we waste looking at our smartphones). 
So that's what you aught to place your hopes in. (I trust Grumbine recognizes 
this as enough of a giant middle finger to the fake democracy 
of "electorialism".)


## Further Realpolitik and Inflation of Name Tags

The flip side of realpolitik you can have with MMT Lens understanding is 
that it can work the other way against the hegemon. They cannot invade 
every country refusing to host their warships or refusing to let the US 
corporations be the ones extracting their mineral resources. International 
solidarity of nations. Sounds like we need to set up some organization 
called "The United Peoples of the World and Their Puppet Representatives 
Talking a Lot".

What "did in" Ghana back in the day? It was greed for the revenues. 
Damn stupid. What was the big rush to develop into a high tech sophisticated 
society? They were already more sophisticated than the USA apes. They just 
didn't know it because Hollywood and all that carry-on which feeds the 
world false ideology that to be sophisticated you need nice new whiteware 
in your home, stocked with CocaCola, and these days own a 
s̶t̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶a̶p̶p̶a̶r̶a̶t̶u̶s̶ ̶s̶u̶r̶v̶e̶i̶l̶l̶a̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶v̶i̶c̶e̶ smartphone.

A nicer looking place to store your beer. Very sophisticated.

The solidarity among the BRICS nations is by far the more hopeful thing for 
their people. They can have a flash new payments system, but the more 
important thing is standing up to help each other when an imperious nation 
imposes sanctions and whatnot. Where were we all when Cuba was in need 
of us? Nowhere to be found, to our shame. (Actually, I don't know, 
maybe NZ exported to Cuba? We would not in 2025 had the blockade 
begun now.)

Cautionary Tale though.

> _Meet the new boss, same as the old boss._

Pessimistically, that's how I see the BRICS when viewed only as an 
escape from payments blocks by the US Treasury and/or Customs/Trade 
agencies. Yes, the USA leadership and elites are like "the evil empire" 
but there is still a lot of that greed and materialism going round. It 
occupies entire lifetimes of activism contributing to slowly stamping it 
all out a tiny bite at a time. 

Don't pin your hopes on the currency system. It is not the place 
for justice. Make it so your MMT understanding frees people's minds to 
focus on what really matters. Our collective power, not the scorepoints. 
Once "the people" 
[Reclaim the State](https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745337326/reclaiming-the-state/), the scorepoints can be then used wisely, instead of how they 
are used today. Will this happen in our lifetimes? I don't know, but I 
see enough _de facto_ Accelerationism that I think it highly likely.

I still don't know if that is good or bad. It's the Mother of All 
Bandaid Rippings Off!  Each little hair torn off in the adhesive to 
capitalism's blood clots is an innocent dead person.  So... yeah, probably 
better to get it ripped off sooner than later. It is a confused metaphor 
I know, I don't know what the wound and bandaid's are analogies for, you 
can dream that up yourself. I'm thinking the wound is capital exploitation 
of workers clearly, most of whom today do not even see themselves as 
exploited. So there are other Bodily symptoms too, like depressions and 
suicides and oxycontin epidemics.  If I was Cutrone I guess I'd say the 
bandaid and Panadol is a dictatorship of the Proletariat?

I did not think this essay would come to such a bloody end!

I just wanted to warn friends to be careful in what they say about BRICS. 
If you rant too much about the "US dollar collapsing" you risk looking 
a fool and the Boy Who Cried Wolf. Or Chicken Little. I'm not sure which. 

I guess the US dollar collapsing is Boy Who Cried Wolf, since _before_ 
the US dollar collapses, the US government might just cease to exist 
an hour earlier. I don't know how, but it'd be in the abstract. Like 
the GOP somehow manage complete and utter fooling of a majority under 
fake populism, and then whoever is in the Whitehouse just plays golf 
forever and stuffs their face with fast food, while in secret leaving 
the entire Sate apparatus over to Musk and Co. to run as a 
lab experiment. 

In that case the USD might come and go on a bi-yearly basis as they 
figure out whether cryptotokens can be actual currency or not, and 
whether the the US dollar scorepoints are not in fact already cryptotokens 
(hint: they _are_ --- ever tried to crack a Bank? You'll need at least 
Kali-Linux for that). 

I've lost track of how many people, both left-wing and right-wing claim 
"the US dollar will collapse". The lucky thing for them the 
Boy Who Cried Wolf parable is no longer modern era applicable. The media 
is not holding the alt-media or the media to account for bad calls. Or when 
they do, CNN style, it's always "We said a lie, but when on air guys, just 
say it was miss-reporting." 24 hours later all is not forgiven, it is just 
not remembered.

Having got that bit of cynicism off my chest, I am well aware I've taken 
the fragile side, not the anti-fragile. So it is a bad move. It always 
pays to be the doomsayer, since no one holds you to account if nothing 
bad happens, but if something perchance bad happens you're the Nostradamus. 

Having got that bit of cynical cynicism off my other chest, who is going 
to attack me when it happens and say I was an idiot for not seeing the 
US dollar collapse?  Luckily probably no one. It won't matter either, 
since I do not own any investments. I'll just work as usual to get the 
new government scorepoints even as those libertarians refuse to call 
themselves "big government."  What are they? "Scientists and futurologists 
of legal dispute resolutions and Ai driven tax credit scorepoint accounting."

In other news: 
[wtf happened to Bill Mitchell?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2NzzF0zJcY) 
I love the guy. But he's such a Doomer. It does not help to say, 
"civilizations collapse, get used to it".  Hell no to that.

Normally I'd shoot myself for saying this, but sometimes, just sometimes, 
it pays to be a pollyanna. Too much digging into ecological collapse 
forecasts and Degrowth circle groupthink, I think, can lead to 
depression. But that's a killer. I know. 

The 𝔣𝔘ℭ𝔎ℑ𝔑𝔊 right-wing ℭ𝔘𝔑𝔗𝔰 know how to wish their world into being, they 
never suffer from depression. They just take action... by finding a new 
neck to stomp upon (also called charging rents). On the liberal-left wing 
there is too much doomerism and hopelessness. It is all warranted, but it 
is useless. So take it, but don't hold onto it, pass it along.

However, as someone prone to lifelong social anxiety and depression I know 
it is not easy to have a pollyanna outlook. Heck, why _do_ I? Everything in 
your heart & soul begs you to be an honest realist. I think it is like 
the Jimmie Hendrix effect. You need to take drugs to just get 
back to normal person mental state. The thing is, you just never fool 
yourself into thinking you are **_not_** being a polyanna. That's the 
trick. You have to know you are a wild optimist, and so are not fooling 
yourself. 

If it helps, I could mention something about quantum probabilities!  The 
future is not determined by the past folks, it just isn't.  Call me if you 
want to learn more about that!  It is not a recipe for pollyannaish 
optimism, it's just a hint of a possibility. Sometimes that's enough to 
spur good people into action. (One of the insidious things the Obama people 
sold, was in fact a good thing: **_hope_** --- it was just too bad they 
were not offering any for actual over-the-counter sale to the plebs, 
oxvcontin instead.) 

Empires collapse far more frequently than civilizations. The (inevitable) 
ecological crisis will collapse oligarchic empires for certain, it does not 
have to collapse civilization. Believe it or not, I reckon it is easily 
possible to have many current empires collapse with the working class 
stiffs hardly aware anything happened. Why? Because so damn unequal we 
are already. 

One Tory 𖧳𖧥𖨚𖢧𖧥𖦪𖦧'𖨚 "collapse" is a working class stiffs daylight.

But that's gedankepolitik for another day, and also fruitless speculation, 
so only my family get to hear me rant about it.
