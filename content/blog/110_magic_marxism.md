Continuing a little MMT critique of Adolph Reed's critique of Magic Marxism, 
or Scientific Socialism.

I have not found any MMT critique to apply yet, which is good, but I wanted to 
amplify one point Reed makes about the use of the word "Science" by the 
magic marxist socialist. The idea Reed gives about what "science" means is, 
I think, good.

> Science seeks to identify physical reality, being that which exists 
externally for all observers, independent of the observer's consciousness.

In short, science is a framework and set of practices that is human and 
conscious, but which seeks to remove the human and the conscious. What remains 
is referred to as the subject of science.

Now, this note has nothing to do with Reed's critique of magix marxism, but 
is important in contemporary topics associated with debates about "Free Will" 
and "artificial consciousness".

### Scientific Marxism

What Reed critiques could be _any_ fetishization of rationality and logic in 
the political realm. So it is not just Magic Marxists he is accusing of 
rank stupidity, it is also the neoliberal technocrats.

## Proper Role fo Science

My framework for anything human is spiritual. But you could say moral. I do 
not like things that are mystical unless they are private, and do not come 
out for lunch. At lunchtime, I need actual food. This means basic ordinary 
spiritual morality. All that means is being loving, kind, just, wise, 
compassionate, honest and also humble.  I do not mean anything more than 
these attributes, the set _define_ spirituality for me to a decent 
approximation.  You all know what counts, and what is maybe a little grey, 
and what is definitely not in the set "spiritual". You know from deeds and 
actions, not from the phonemes or letters of words.

This really, was Reed's point.

Real politics considers the human spirit.

There is a nicer way to state all this without Reed's academic jargon, 
which is that Science and Religion are not in conflict, and never have been. 
This is also a Baháʼí philosophy.

> When Science and Religion are not in harmony then one or both are false.

Now you know that, as a philosophical principle, you can use what you may 
believe to be honestly valid science to eliminate what is false religion 
(Christian fascism for example).  What really is the origin of fascism? It 
is not Christianity, it is anti-Christianity, a loss of faith, a replacement 
of faith with some creed like nationalism.

But you can also use what you may think to be honestly valid religion to 
eschew false science (anti-vaxx activism, anti-global warming propaganda, 
technocracy, authoritarianism. worker exploitation).

But genuine spirituality is more power, it is at least as powerful as science, 
because like science it is self-correcting. One your religious ideology turns 
fetid and corrupt it will lead to hatred and violence, and then you know it 
is false. A bit like getting a negative result in an experiment that your 
'science' predicted would be positive.

There is another thing I learned from the Baháʼí Faith, which is also 
something I got from Gödel.

> Science and mathematics (logic) are incomplete, so provide us with exact 
knowledge of very few things. <br>
Religion is complete, but provides us within inexact knowledge and all things.

You can see how both are complementary and work in harmony. 

When _either_ science or religion becomes unthinking ideology it can 
quickly switch from being previously valid (in some context) to now false.
