Continuing a little MMT critique of Adolph Reed's critique of Magic Marxism, 
or Scientific Socialism.

I have not found any MMT critique to aply yet, whcih is good, but I wanted to 
amplify one point Reed makes about the use of the word "Science" by the 
magic marxist socilaist. The idea Reed gives about what "science" means is, 
I think, good.

> Sceicne seeks to idnetify physical reality, being that whihc exists 
externally for all observers, independnet of the observer's consiousness.

In short, scence is a framework and set of prcticies that is human and 
conscious, but whihch seeks to remve the human and the conscious. What remains 
is referred to as the subject of science.

Now, this note has nothing to do with Reed's critique of magix marxism, but 
is important in contemporary topics associated with debates about "Free Will" 
and "artificial consciousness".
