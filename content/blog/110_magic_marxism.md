Continuing a little MMT critique of Adolph Reed's 
[critique of Magic Marxism](https://radar.auctr.edu/endarch-journal-black-political-research-vol-1974-no-1-fall-1974?active_member=67041), 
or [(Reed, 2025) “Scientific Socialism”](https://nonsite.org/looking-backward-to-counter-mysticism-and-despair/#foot_src_45-25114).

I did not find too many MMT critiques to apply, which is good, but I wanted to 
amplify one point Reed makes about the use of the word "Science" by the 
magic marxist socialist. The idea Reed gives about what "science" means is, 
I think, good.

> _Science seeks to identify physical reality, being that which exists 
externally for all observers, independent of the observer's consciousness._

In short, science is a framework and set of practices that is human and 
conscious, but which seeks to remove the human and the conscious. What remains 
is referred to as the subject of science.

That note has nothing to do with Reed's critique of magik marxism, 
but is important in contemporary topics associated with debates about "Free Will" 
and "artificial consciousness".  For Reed's thoughts, reduced to MMT-dimwit 
(which is yours truly) readability, read onwards.

## Scientific Marxism

What Reed critiques could be _any_ fetishization of rationality and logic in 
the political realm. So it is not just Magic Marxists he is accusing of 
rank stupidity, it is also the neoliberal technocrats.

## Proper Role of Science

My framework for anything human is spiritual. But you could say moral. I do 
not like things that are mystical unless they are private, and do not come 
out for lunch. At lunchtime, I need actual food. This means basic ordinary 
spiritual morality. All that means is being loving, kind, just, wise, 
compassionate, honest and also humble.  I do not mean anything more than 
these attributes, this set _defines_ spirituality for me to a decent 
approximation.  You all know what counts, and what is maybe a little grey, 
and what is definitely not in the set "spiritual". You know from deeds and 
actions, not from the phonemes or letters or words.

This really, was Reed's point.

Real politics considers the human spirit.

There is a nicer way to state all this without Reed's academic jargon, 
which is that Science and Religion are not in conflict, and never have been. 
This is also a Baháʼí philosophy.

> _When Science and Religion are not in harmony then one or both are false._

The modernist conceit is, "that which is at fault is religion." That's not only 
a dark and loathsome prejudice of our times, it is dangerous. Equally as 
dangerous as anti-religion 
masquerading as genuine religion, which is just about all churches, mosques, 
temples, seminaries and whatnot in the world today.  You can however 
find **genuine religion** all over the place, in the hearts of decent people, 
and all the more so when they are _not_ in church or temples, but actually out 
in the world helping people out of the gutter. 

Now you know that, as a philosophical principle, you can use what you may 
believe to be honestly valid science to eliminate what is false religion 
(christian fascism for example).  What really is the origin of fascism? It 
is not Christianity, it is anti-Christianity, a loss of faith, a replacement 
of faith with some creed like nationalism, the Nation becomes the Sacred 
$\sim$ anti-religion.

But you can also use what you may think to be honestly valid religion to 
eschew false science (anti-vaxx activism, anti-global warming propaganda, 
technocracy, authoritarianism, worker exploitation).

But genuine spirituality is more power, it is at least as powerful as science, 
because like science it is self-correcting. Once your religious ideology turns 
fetid and corrupt it will lead to hatred and violence, and then you know it 
is false. A bit like getting a negative result in an experiment that your 
'science' predicted would be positive.

There is another thing I learned from the Baháʼí Faith, which is also 
something I got from Gödel.

> Science and mathematics (logic) are incomplete, so provide us with exact 
knowledge but of very few things. <br><br>
Religion is complete, but provides us within inexact knowledge yet of all things.

You can see how both are complementary and work in harmony. 

When _either_ science or religion becomes unthinking ideology it can 
quickly switch from being previously valid (in some context) to now false.

Ask any electrician or home-body, flipping switches can be a dangerous 
activity, especially when one is left 'on'.



### Reed Knows the Biz

I cannot critique this next bit, but just applaud Reed for getting it right.

He points out the _scientific socialists_ are not only nutters, but probably 
dangerously so, because 

**(a)** what cannot be measured cannot be adjudicated by science,<br><br>
**(b)** _"The problem is that intellectual systems and frameworks are 
developed by human beings within society, and to that extent those frameworks 
and systems must reflect the class reality of the social order. Therefore, 
since scientism as an analytic frame of reference (rather than merely a number 
of research techniques) is the product of bourgeois society, the **method itself** 
must reflect the biases of bourgeois social organization"_

Which is a pretty good and heady take on, **"You cannot necessarily fix the 
broken things using the tools that did the breaking."**  In political economy 
this translates to: You cannot depend upon the goodwill of a Tory nor a 
Neoliberal, because their goodwill is what the worker sees as explicit 
ill-will.  Actually, this can even be measured! So even a scientific socialist 
might agree.

Reed presents this as a Trichotomy: (1) science is bourgeois, or (2) science 
is suprahuman (so mystical), or (3) science is a pre-existing package we 
discover (so is reified).

Of course, all three pertain to how we go about things "scientific" 
in various contexts. But so do other aspects pertain, like having a great ball 
of fun mucking around in the laboratory or on an abacus. Science is, for me 
personally, above all else, playful inventiveness. The goal of which is to hope 
to be correct about the world, and uncover hidden realities, but not to expect 
by any divine right of "hard work" or rule-following protestantism that you 
will be successful.

> Reed: _"Science cannot be absolutized if it is taken as the product of a given form of social knowledge.  Therefore, science cannot be considered  **the** form of knowledge but only a particular form of knowledge"._

💯<font style="color: tomato">%</font>🎯

The take-away is that we (by moral force) should never absolutize science. We 
cannot ever let science rule. This is not the purpose of science in a decent 
sloppy and democratic society. Science is, for the dirtbags, a wonderful 
artistic pursuit, with beautiful empirical concrete results. Useful in 
engineering, useful to keep the nerd riff-raff fully employed. Once we reify 
or totalitarianize science as in some monstrosity called Technocracy or 
whatever, or scientific socialism, we are doomed to moral failures and brainrot.

For the dirtbag, science by very good nature has to be explorative and playful, 
and should never be rigidized or driven by rules and norms. Those latter are 
the death of science.  Science, the good kind, seeks to uncover Nature's rules, 
but by some pretty odd-ball non-rules means, like this weird activity called 
𝓭𝗼🅾𝗱𝚕𝖎ⓝ𝑔 & 𝔱𝗵ⓘ𝓃𝑘𝒊𝙣🅶. Which are equal parts mystical, reified (yes, we do 
discover "truths"), culturally filtered, and sometimes even crazy stupid. 
Not the sort of minds you necessarily want in government. 

In government we want moral minds, not technocrats. However, to placate you 
nerds-who-want-to-rule-the-world, I'd say that of course those minds need to 
have a grasp of basic facts, and accounting logic, as well as their kindness 
and compassion. After all, if you mistake a minus sign for a positive sign, all 
your good-will can become by your sheer ignorance, some poor person's abject 
misery & suffering though through no fault of their own (aka. unemployment).

That's why you _might_ prefer Stephanie Tinwoman Kelton (a fictional character) 
who <font style="color: mediumpurple">has no heart</font> running some government operations than Jacinda Adern with 
<font style="color: pink">all the heart in the world</font> 
but no comprehension of how the monetary system works.

I realize that all seems anti-Reedian. Aren't I promoting the 
Bourgois here (Tinwoman Kelton)? No, I am not, it was just a cartoon example, 
a counterfactual, not the real world.

I mean, have a think about it! I'd far prefer full employment and a 
job guarantee, but under some heartless sociopaths dispensing the scorepoints, 
than the massive generational suffering and crippling of unemployment under 
some happy-go-lucky liberal clowns who go about defending LGBTQ+ rights. What 
human rights are worth having if you cannot get enough tax credits just to 
pay your rent?

This is, of course, a false dichotomy. Counterfactual.

More often the two minds go hand-in-hand, for the wise and compassionate 
person in some sort of position 
of temporary power, is far more likely to acknowledge the reality of MMT --- 
the source of all unemployment is the government policy. They will then fix 
it, or at least die trying.  But this takes time. Jacinda did not make the 
time. But she could have, she had the heart and soul for it. Labour Party 
neoliberal apparatchiks were too noisy in her ears --- which is one reason 
why you do not want the Apple Inc. iphone ibuds airbuds or whatever, probably 
got some malicious neoliberal firmware etched into them! 🤣  They drowned 
out her better "angel" impulses. Hard to blame her completely.

BTW, I am happy to write all that under an Adolph Reed review, since I 
highly doubt Reed knows the deal either. Though if he were NZ Prime Minister, 
I dare say we'd not today have any child poverty. Tautologically? Since for 
Reed to ever become PM he'd automatically have a fully leftiepol dirtbag 
caucus and house majority. (Apologies to all Kiwi's who would be even better 
Prime Ministers.)

The No.1 eligibility requirement for being in elected political office in 
my Book of Dirtbag is that you do not want to be in official government 
politics. **The People** force you to take up the burden, and you fight 
against them, until you realize you cannot win. The People basically stick 
the Bill legislation under your hand, and torture you with electrodes to move 
your hand so the pen marks your signature. OK, maybe not that extreme.  I think 
I could do the job if the torture device was a ham & cheese sandwich.
 

## The Kalecki--Robinson Mind-Meld

[Reed parrots](https://nonsite.org/looking-backward-to-counter-mysticism-and-despair/) 
what Kalecki (and Robinson) thought of efforts to 
gain government policy of full employment:

He quotes [Kalecki](https://nonsite.org/looking-backward-to-counter-mysticism-and-despair/):

> "..."under a regime of permanent full employment, the “sack” would cease 
to play its role as a disciplinary measure. The social position of the boss 
would be undermined, and the self-assurance and class-consciousness of the 
working class would grow. Strikes for wage increases and improvements in 
conditions of work would create political tension. It is true that profits 
would be higher under a regime of full employment than they are on the 
average under laissez-faire; and even the rise in wage rates resulting from 
the stronger bargaining power of the workers is less likely to reduce profits 
than to increase prices, and thus adversely affects only the rentier 
interests. But “discipline in the factories” and “political stability” are 
more appreciated than profits by business leaders. Their class instinct tells 
them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of view, and 
that unemployment is an integral part of the “normal” capitalist system."

... which is essentially why we do in fact need (perhaps) to pass through 
some sort of phase of Dictatorship of the Proletariat.

The point is (not often enough stressed by Cutrone) that such a dictatorship 
can be very nice for everyone. Even the formerly super-rich. They can probably 
even retain their pearls (we cannot eat them).

How do the workers make pearls and diamonds useless, hence valueless? Easy. 
Do not covet them, so you never need to buy them  To _you_ their fair price 
is zero.  Who cares then about the market for them?  "Not I," said the 
Richard Wolff.


### The Better MMT Frame

The issue is, we do _not_ live under Capitalism.

So that Kaleckian argument does not apply.

We live under plutocracy (or oligopoly, take your pick). 

However, I would guess the argument still works because governments are 
ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ. That's because they are largely controlled (or influenced) by 
ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ oligarchs.  They are undermining our collective real wealth with 
their imposed austerity.

The argument really is that stupid people cannot figure out that a decline in 
their real wealth can be accommodated with a net rise on overall real wealth. 
The Whole benefits more than some Parts.

So the Kaleckian Argument really just morphed a little bit. Under an unfair 
labour market, the oligarch has no cause for nightmares. 

What they should fear is grass roots organization developing a take-over of 
government through entirely peaceful means, and _de facto_ installing a 
virtual Dictatorship of the Prolertariat. Only it'd only be _de facto_. 
How?  Simple. Ordinary decent people get the seats in government, but vote 
or crook or by hook.  I'd prefer by vote". But you know how that works!
It ain't gonna happen without grass roots organization, since the Top End of 
Town will never hand it to us on a wooden platter.

Like I was (trying) to tell my right-wing or "business sympathizing" friend 
the other day: He wants business people running government, since they, 
"know how to run a business."  I laughed (or suppressed a laugh) and explained 
the since the monetary system is critical for government functioning, and it 
needs to be more spending than tax return, we want the opposite of 
savers-by-mentality running government, we want Big Spenders.

At this stage in Twenty-first Century neoliberal post-capitalism (we are 
in worse then mere capitalism), we could do with totally Drunken Sailors in 
the Parliament seats of power. As long as they have kind hearts, and crack a 
lot of jokes. The more drunk the better. (I am not scared 
of the inflation boogeyman.)


## Unemployment is Not a Productivity Story

Reed however does eventually disappoint, he writes of the (largely 
fantastical) "class harmony" in post-war USA:

> ""But how could the claim of mutual benefit and positive-sum class relations 
be credible if employers were ever more inclined to pursue productivity 
increases that resulted in net displacement of living labor?"

No argument that he is correct in pointing out the fallacy of class harmony. 

He fails however, to realize the private sector and productivity/technology gains, 
are _not an unemployment story_.  Presumably because Reed is unaware that 
the source of all unemployment is the government.

"Displaced labour" is a false narrative. That is **freed labour** that the 
capitalists care not about. The government can always hire the displaced 
labour, without question, and no capitalist ever "pays for" this, in fact 
they benefit. All the government payments to such newly public sector workers 
is net currency injection with which the firms can sell to to soak up and 
hoard driblets from after they have eaten and played gold, squirrelled away 
into their bank accounts. 

This MMT account of course does not illegitimate the earlier endorsement 
of Kalecki and Robinson, since their arguments still apply, precisely because 
government is essentially (or is it _virtually_) run by the plutocrats and 
oligarchy, or their lapdogs, one or the other. 

The rest of Reed's essay I would say is academically interesting, but we can 
stop here, since this is the crux:

> Take the base case for full employment in a market (not capitalist, not 
socialist, not anything in particular --- just "some sort of government") 
which is a Job Guarantee policy.  _Then_ the private firm has no fear. The 
JG is not competing with private employers, since it is a floor wage. All a 
firm needs to do is offer slightly better than the JG wage and benefits (or 
some suitable combination).

Kalecki and Robinson had no such understanding, so were in fact ultimately 
false framing the issue of full employment. Shame on them. However, their 
political power argument still gains some validity. It's just not as bad for 
us as they made out.

Today this is a counterfactual argument, so a bit pointless, but it is still 
interesting to ponder. If the USA had a JG, would private employers really 
be complaining?  They'd likely be making more sales, hence more profit. 
Only a few utterly oppressive employers would go out of business, and no 
one would shed tears for them.

My lazy guess is that the JG will still have opposition in Congress (or in 
NZ in our Parliament) because people are just ignorant, and cannot see their 
own benefit. In New Zealand in particular, since we have pretty historically 
low corruption rates compared to other nations. Our businesses are pretty 
"clean" I would say. Most are not rent-seeking scum. (I could be wrong.)

My lazy guess is that the bigger more powerful private employers and their 
lobby groups would just simply oppose a JG just for the hellofit. Cut off 
their sales & profit noses to spite their face. Of course, IRL that's their 
employees faces. Their own faces get plenty of economic plastic surgery 
thanks to government hand-outs like Treasury bonds and LLC protection laws, 
failure to regulate monopoly price takers, rentiers, and all the rest..
They are not nice people. That is the crux of it. It is not a macroeconomics 
or political economy issue _per se_.  **It is a moral issue, a spiritual issue.**


## Last Words

I'll let Reed have the last words, and spare you needing to read his whole 
long-winded can-you-plz-get-to-the-point essay. It wraps things up, and his
 conclusion bears nothing I disagree with.
 
It's just that _one of the weaponized lies_ is a critical one that Reed 
has missed, the myth of mainstream macroeconomics, that the government 
<font style="color: #ff6347">"Needs to find the money, so has to either tax or borrow."</font>  Unless that myth is busted --- in the minds of the workers 
who are prepared to organize --- the efforts Reed urges us undertake could be utterly in vain. Not only is 
<font style="color: #3cb371 ">grass roots labour organization</font> needed, but an educational layer 
needs laying first --- or in parallel, since why wait for the learning, we 
can walk and shoot in _The Matrix_ at the same time.

Workers have to know that when good people seize power and start "spending 
like drunken sailors by typing numbers into worker bank accounts" that 
nothing will "collapse" or crumble. No unit of account is going to head 
to zero. The State's unit of account is always worth exactly what the 
government says you have to do to get one unit. If only Kalecki and 
Robinson had known, it might have filtered through to Reed and McAlevey, 
two fo the 'good guys'.

> _"Countering the effects of a half-century of barely challenged neoliberal 
hegemony will require a great effort of political education and organizing 
to combat the weaponized lies and subterfuge that define American politics 
today. This will have to be conducted largely through slow, face-to-face 
processes that rely on establishing relations of trust and standing with 
others not already on our side. (On the electoral front, non-candidate, 
issue-based ballot campaigns can be a useful component of such organizing, as 
they can do political education and issue-shaping on a wider scale and 
facilitate making direct contacts with workers. And left-oriented initiatives 
have been instructively successful even in states that routinely spurn 
Democratic candidates.)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the late 
[Jane McAlevey \[in “No Shortcuts”\]](https://janemcalevey.com/no-shortcuts/) argued 
and demonstrated so forcefully, there can be no shortcuts in building the 
sort of movement 
necessary to challenge the dangerous forces arrayed against us. The 
effort required is therefore not reducible to electoral dynamics; we cannot 
elect our way out of this horrible moment. We can hope only to keep the worst 
at bay while we organize the alternative political force. And I shall 
disclose here the not-so-secret punch line of my book, which the last eighty 
years of American political history demonstrate and with which I know Jane 
would also agree: there is no effective substitute for an anti-capitalist 
left. And the most serious political work ahead of us for the foreseeable 
future is to throw everything we can into generating one."_
