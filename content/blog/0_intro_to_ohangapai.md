These are raw journal entries. 
An Ōhanga Pai hackers journal.
For specific content articles in chapter format see [Philosophy](/ohanga-pai/questions/) or [Empirical](/ohanga-pai/empirical/) sections.

We've got a few projects on-the-go.

1. Asset exchange models (Drăgulescu--Ispolatov--Yakovenko models) 
2. Keen--Goodwin models in python (pymsky project)
3. Job Guarantee models in the Keen--Goodwin framework.
4. Econometric analysis of the central bank interest rate policy --- are interest rate hikes inflationary in the short run? (Interest--income and forward pricing channels overwhelm the propensity to save/borrow discriminants). 

The development software is not yet up on the github repo, we are still alpha testing. 
So be patient.

These web pages are only for discussions, they are not software documentation. 
For software documentation each project will have it's own Sphinx RTD docs.
