#### Weighing the Unit of Account Mark-II

Yeah. It does not weigh much. But it is extremely weighty --- matters of 
life & death.

"_Money is an IOU of the issuer. The problem is not killing others to get 
it accepted._" --- Bijou Minskysmith.

This is an abbreviated version of the substack piece with the same title. 
I made a big mistake in it, which Ghost prompted me to correct.

Last week I wrote (containing a falsehood):
> "You (and I) pay the tax to drain demand so(?) people constantly are 
willing to work to get another tax credit, which drives real production, 
which produces the real output retirees (which hopefully we all can become 
by the age of 40 soon) can consume."

After Ghost withheld my biscuits, I added:  
"Except even this üëÜüèºis not the proper story, it is not the correct 
causality, the correct story is..."

{{<tax_credits_and_debt>}}


Thing is, whoever is in power should comprehend all this, whether they 
want to blow up Russians or Chinese, torture immigrants, or otherwise.
Ignorance is never good. If we all know they know then our demands can be 
that much stronger. 

As Grumbine always says (I paraphrase and take license):

> ‚ÄúMMT is no cure for macroeconomic ills. A genocide denier can run a 
payments system to support genocide, guarantee full employment & price 
stability.‚Äù


... the rest is on substack.

## Real Costs

Seems a lot of people who are n00bies to MMT get into tangles thinking 
MMT is a set of policy subscriptions.  **Big mistake!**

> MMT is an accurate description of a tax driven (or chartalist) 
currency system.  
MMT does not support capitalism (but _you_ could! ... why?)  
MMT does not support socialism (but _you_ can!)

I like to say the only political economy mindset incompatible with MMT 
is Neoliberalism (which to a dirtbag MMT'er could be non-standardly defined 
as 
<font style="color: #e280df ">"_Anyone thinking the government has to get the tax credit before it 
creates the tax credit._"</font> --- Why? Because that simple yet false backwards 
sequence is what drives _most_ neoliberal policy. Here we can grant some 
degree of wishful fantasy in assuming neoliberals do not set out at the 
gun to be cruel and stupid. They only evolve that way (let's be generous) 
because they have no clue the system they govern is an MMT system.

One of the big aims of MMT activism is to remove completely this ignorance 
so that our generosity towards neoliberals diminishes over time until they 
become outright cruel by intention. Then the mask is truly all peeled 
away, and they are exposed to the wrath of the masses like never before.

The Occupy Movement never peeled away the whole mask, since (I would hazard 
a guess) 90% of Occupy Movement protesters were "We gotta raise taxes to 
pay for it."  In other words, in league with Maggie Thatcher.

What is the real take-away?  It is,

> MMT supports _any_ system you have if MMT is the currency framework. 

There is nothing pro-Marx, nor anti-worker, nor "propping up capitalism", 
nor "woke", nor "anti-woke" about MMT. Unless you agree to "be woke" means 
to desire an accurate framework for analysis of soft currencies and hard 
commodities.

MMT systems have existed for thousands of years.

There is an important spiritual principle here:

> Truth and honesty, and before that the desire to seek truth, is a 
spiritual virtue (regardless of any practical benefits, which 
normally also accrue).

It is not hard to see that trying to do away with MMT is a moral hazard. 
What do you plan to replace the currency system with?  How do you know it 
will be any better in social outcomes?  Can you even have a "moneyless" economy?

The answer to that last question is "No!"  In any community where there 
are records of social obligations you have a money system. It might not 
be formalized, so the unit of account is vague, and only realized in people's 
memories. In a large enough city that becomes unsustainable, and account 
ledgers are needed --- not to drive "capitalism" or markets, but for 
simple **_Justice_**.  A spiritual virtue.

A further point to ponder is what fatal flaw of MMT systems make the 
system work so horribly? No one truly knows, so you cannot just stick MMT 
knowledge up as a strawman and tell me we must abandon soft currencies 
because they do no good. You first have to show us that people in power 
understand they are in charge of an MMT system. If they are, then...

... well, even _then_ you cannot make the argument social ills deriving 
from monetary poverty or financial instability are the fault of MMT. Even 
in this hypothetical scenario I would still say the problem is policy and 
lack of spiritual principles. MMT is only the accounting system available to 
governments. It is neither good nor bad. All moral ad value attributions 
are what people impose exogenously. And that is where all teh problems arise.

They would be the same problems under any arrangement of records of account! 

Or so I will claim. Can you prove otherwise? What does a peg to gold get 
you, other than constant deflations and debt crises and a massive benefiting 
of the super rich and pirates the most?

## Gluten is Not Free

It costs a worker their labour to produce gluten-free anything. The point 
here being governments can always provide for "free lunch" programs in 
school. It need cost the "tax payer" nothing. **_Nothing._**

However, nothing is free. The Sun and Soil do not just grow food for 
us, the real cost of "free" school lunches is the labour of the workers. 
By being employed by the State they are not free to be working doing 
something else.  What else?  Who can know?  But are they going to voluntarily 
still help out kids in lower income district schools, or anything more 
valuable for society?

But again, this is nether a good thing nor a bad thing. For many 
schools free lunch programs are a good thing, and so there is a good 
government policy option here. Provided the workers making the lunches 
could not be doing more useful things for society. Could they? That is 
the question to ask. Not, "Where is the wage bill coming form? If not 
me taxes?"

---

This did not segue to where I wished to end, but I will go to the end 
anyway, It is another issue people seem to "have with MMT" which has 
nothing to do with MMT. Some folks are out their claiming something along 
the lines of "oh, mmt is silly, it says we cna have free stuff... but this 
is only going to create hyperinflation."

(Maybe I've constructed a starwman here, but I' swear I've heard this 
many times.)

My response is that the government cannot spend on anything not already 
for sale. They can outbid the other buyers, always, with a vote in Parliament, 
but why would they? The lesson of teh austerity years is that almost all 
governments are dead scared of spending too much, except for war. And 
the artificial fiscal constraints are always removed for war spending 
anyway. (Or have you been living under a rock all these years?) 

There is no point therefore in constraining governments artificially. 
Let them know they can _always_ employ all unemployed people. Always. 
If there are artificial constraints then dollars to donuts the 
neoliberal type mind will use it as a (false) excuse to keep the poor 
poor and the least powerful workers unemployed --- to "discipline inflation". 
While more "evil" things do occur, nothing could be more banal in "evil" 
than this --- for a dirtbag MMT'er.

If you honestly believe unemployment is better to have than inflation 
then I am afraid the lessons of history are dead against you, and your 
burden is to show me full employment implies any amount of inflation 
whatsoever. You cannot.  Employment is never the source of inflation. 

Besides all that, maybe a subtle point I find incredibly too few grasp: 
_deflation is far worse for the poor._ It raises the burden of their past 
debt and disproportionately benefits the hoarders. (This is not an 
argument for "letting inflation rip." There are political psychology 
reasons why governments should also use price stabilization polices, 
like taxes on rents, especially land, and progressive income tax --- 
why? Because inflation for no sound reason, except false psychology, 
can get an otherwise good government voted out of office. For some mad 
reason, bordering on mass psychopathy, people seem to prefer 
unemployment to inflation. 

Can anyone tell me why? I truly do not know. Is it just greed and 
the outrageous cruel incentives governments impose forcing people 
to generate insatiable savings desires? 

It is worse than this though. Full employment is not linked to inflation, 
except via misguided policy. Another banality of evil. The fear of 
inflation is legit for the hoarders, but they are wrong that it implies 
to quell their fear they (since _they_ are always the elites) must 
discipline workers. I should elaborate, but this is longer story of 
the NAIRU myth which is for another day.

Is this all too materialistic for you?

Then let me finish on a spiritual note. Another thing MMT reveals is that 
the source of all unemployment _today_ (I do not care about past eras 
or unusual systems) is government. Governments _today_ cause all the 
unemployment = people seeking the tax credit. 

If you do not like that thought, you can instead say plutocrats and 
oligarchs _today_ are causing all unemployment, and I would agree, 
since they are the ones who control our governments, in one way or 
another (they are either many of the politicians or the influencers and 
lobbyists who push certain politicians upon our government). 

The governments are damaging people with austerity policies, not just 
in material terms, but spiritually as well. If you've never been unemployed 
for a decent stretch of time I guess I can see why you do not understand. 
But it kills people inside, well before actual physical death. 

It is immoral for this to be happening, but perhaps a thing to be 
forgiven since the people running our governments are so ignorant.
In any case I consider it a spiritual burden to try to educate 
youngsters today, who may become leaders tomorrow.
