> "To fund or not to fund, that is the question Horatio."   
 --- _Mlet_ by William Stringspeare.
 
Came across a 
[“science” channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0b9eHBG8zc) with a new 
idea for fundamental physics.
I like to give such folks a chance. It was not nearly crazy enough, sorry 
to say.

But the guys introduction --- a rant against String Theory --- was worth 
a comment.

> @21:0 nah, the heart of the problem is not extra dimensions — the 
experiments to probe that hypothesis do not exist, but they might one day. 
The core problem is "capitalism" writ large, and neoliberalism (gutting of 
public good funding) in particular and long standing false paradigms 
concerning macroeconomics. Hint: public science and services are _not_ 
"tax payer funded". No one can get the state currency to pay a dime in tax 
until the government first lends or spends. Governments do not spend 
using "tax payer dollars" — there is no such thing, all currency since 
antiquity is the IOU of the authority (church, state, temple, palace, etc). 
So public funding is the exact opposite of what the "tax payer" 
rhetoric suggests.

I continued:

All good science begins with a wisdom motive, and the ongoing need of 
worker-scientists to eat to survive, the profit motive then takes over and 
then enshittification ensues, unless the idea has a competitor.  So the 
core problem is String/M theory has few credible competitors. That is 
saying something, because String Theory itself is rubbish, as you say. It 
is the least bad rubbish. If we want serious competitors we need to give 
other thinkers a salary to do the work.

But science is not in the "let's fund the right project" business. By 
definition you cannot know which ideas are going to pan out. So inherently 
good science is not a capitalist enterprise, it can never be pure 
capitalist, except by sheer good luck. So funding agencies need to have 
waaaay more open minds.The key is public finance. The government cannot 
run out of its own IOU (aka. tax credit, aka. "dollars"), so can always pay 
the wage for any science nerd, in perpetuity. The cost to the private sector 
is the real cost of real resources, mainly the labour of that science nerd 
is no longer available in the private sector, otherwise her wage is bid up. 
But the currency issuer (government) can always outbid the private sector, 
whether they should or not is the question (the out-bidding is defined as 
a price pressure, it can become inflationary if it occurs across a wide 
spectrum of economic sectors without an increase in currency withdrawal = 
saving or tax returns)

The State wishes to claim real resources, not its own I.O.U. 
(aka. "the money"). Thus, the State needs us to need their otherwise 
worthless currency. How do they force us to need it? They impose tax 
liabilities. (And most people running governments have no clue this is 
what they are doing. How does that compare to the brain rot of extra 
space dimensions?!!!)  The tax return is a redemption operation, not a 
funding operation. Once you understand this, you realize leaving good 
scientists unemployed is a simple (tragic) policy mistake. The government 
is the source of _all_ unemployment (defined as people seeking to exchange 
their goods or labour for the tax credit). Why do governments needlessly 
leave massive numbers of people unemployed, typically 6% to 10% of the 
able workforce, and 20% to 40% (in some countries) 
drastically _underemployed?_  It is a banal evil — the governments do not 
understand the purpose of their own monetary system.  It is a massive 
waste of human lives, and the *_real_* cost of lost output from 
unemployment in a decade _today_ exceeds the real costs of all wars in 
all human history. That is how much human productivity has advanced. Think 
about that!  It is a huge f-ing problem that makes String Theory cliques 
and groupthink dwarf into insignificance by comparison.
