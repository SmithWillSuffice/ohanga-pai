this time.


## The Parasitism

This is a comment on Brian Romanchuk's blogging on FED and Treasury bond 
policy.  I see it as all gigantic parasitic financial sector activity, it 
should be eliminated entirely. With one caveat.

When central banks offer a risk free rate, I see it as nothing but,
"*basic income but only for people who already have money, in proportion to how much they already have.*" (wbmosler).

[Here Romanchuk](https://bondeconomics.substack.com/p/using-fed-projections-to-infer-the)
is discussing the "term premium" ...
[Using Fed Projections To Infer The Term Premium?](https://bondeconomics.substack.com/p/using-fed-projections-to-infer-the)

It is all financial bro bs to me. Why give rich folks incentive to hold 
cash? They can only spend it on what is for sale, and the way to avoid 
overheating the economy is not to offer the rich a bonus, but to restrict what 
is for sale. Regulations are needed to limit our energy through-put, and no 
amount of "free market" laissez faire will achieve this. Markets have failed, 
and will continue to fail, to price-in far future ecological crises. Offering 
them interest to hold their cash is no solution at all to nominal or real 
inflation, it makes things worse, since it cheapens the currency.


### Is it Parasitic?

Governments issuing fiat currency giving interest income to the rich is not so 
much parasitism as simple greedflation. Basic Income.  But only for the rich. 
Almost as if these people are our superiors and need to be rewarded for 
thinking so!

Oh yeah, that's right... they were the virtuous "savers". (Don't make me laugh.)

Who is truly virtuous and helping drive the real economy? It's the spenders. 

You could thus use the language of leeches, rather than parasites. But I'd 
just ditch the biology metaphors and say they're greedy, and people running 
governments are too dumb to stop feeding the greed at the source.


## Caveat 

A Warren Mosler (and Randy Wray) often argue, it would likely be pretty  
disruptive to stop issuing short term Tsy bonds.   The idea then would be for 
Central Banks to continue issuing 3-month Treasury Bills, in order to stabilize 
the overnight cash rate. 

But this is in inside banking account operation, it should not be Tsy issue 
for private investors. With this proviso, issuing 3-month bills avoids 
disruption to the existing banking system, with minimal legislation jinking, 
and yet avoids the financial sector parasitism.

((Also, I'm more in Bill Mitchell's MMM/MMT camp on this one, let's just fix 
banking properly and stop issuing all bonds entirely, if for no other reason 
than to make the point MMT/MMM is correct.))

(((MMM = "Modern-money-mechanics", the framework formerly known as MMT.;-) ))
