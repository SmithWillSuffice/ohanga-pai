Mea cupla a bit. I got privately scolded for abusing a bond trader who had a 
chat with an MMT educator. It was ok to be scolded, since I did not think I 
was being abusive of character. I was for sure being abusive about the menaing 
of some strings of words coming at me from my audio speaker, which is not 
good. It's nicer to make a point for the source of the words and leave people 
alone to ponder.

I could have been construed as behaving abusively in my writing. However, I 
have some more to say about that.

First is, which bond trader millionaire cares what I have to say about 
their character? How on earth are they ever going to make me feel less 
powerful and invisible and gaslit than I already am? 

Second, their charatcer is unknown to me, but anyone with any moral recitutde 
knows trading the financial markets is parasitism. It's not good for your 
soul. Rich men and eyes of needles and whatnot. So I think it is fair game 
to critique the thinking of financial traders. I would like them to be better 
people _and_ support MMT. Not just merely support MMT.

Thirdly, his (no names today) thinking was for sure 𐝥ꗍꖡꗇ𐝥ꕒꗍꕒ.  As in 
backwards. Not a slur on his character as a father, fair sportsnman, or 
grandfather or anything, he might be a thoroughly decent bloke (I just hihgly 
doubt it, just based on what wordws came out of his mouth (I was only 
listening to audio)).
