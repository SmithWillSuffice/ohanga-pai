One of those _feel good stories_ today, and crossing over with my 
mathematics interests.  But you know it!... gonna be tinged with neoliberal 
hate. LOL.

The story was broadcast on 
[CBS 60 Minutes here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHeWndnHuQs)
--- it is a freakin' _great_+ story, poorly presented. Except well-presented 
with all the professionalism of corporate news!

Two high school students, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, seniors at 
St. Mary's Academy, _independently_ discovered new proofs of Pythagoras' 
Theorem using only trigonometry.

At 2min in the episode both students claim they were interested in solving 
the bonus question their teacher had given on a test for a monetary prize 
incentive. US\$500. Nothing to sneeze at for high school students. 
But why did CBS have to air that soundbite? Cos' they're neoliberal.

Let me rant a bit about why this was a big deal, before getting to the core 
of this post, which is why the prize incentive was rotten.

## Why such a big deal?




## The Problem with Prize Money

(And the problem with extrinsic rewards entirely.)

Any decent mathematician would not be solving such a problem for the prize 
money. The effort the students put in was worth far more than US\$500, if 
they had been paid a wage to work on the puzzle. They should have been paid 
to work on it.  Being paid a wage does not mean one is not learning.

Prize monies are often like this. Except perhaps for the million dollar 
Clay Millenium Prizes and the Nobel, or Abel. Those bigger prizes recognize 
lifetime achievements, and so are fair compensation for sacrificing a lot to 
work on serious mathematics. For most people they are more than a wage. The 
problem is that they are only a wage for **_one person_** and this degrades or 

Alfie Kohn, I dare say, would agree with me. Twitt3r might not, but I'm no 
longer involved in that swamp.



## Summary based-MMT Thoughts

(Well... _I_ think they're based. ðŸ˜‚)

Most people are perfectly capable of motivating themselves with scarcity. I do 
it all the time with food --- I will exercise to earn my meal. 
The CBS story reported the high creativity shown by Calcea and N''., but 
does not stop to ponder how uncreative the idea of the monetary prize was, 
and how insidious.
