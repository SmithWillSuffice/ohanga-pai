One of those _feel good stories_ today, and crossing over with my 
mathematics interests.  But you know it!... gonna be tinged with neoliberal 
hate. LOL.

The story was broadcast on 
[CBS 60 Minutes here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHeWndnHuQs)
--- it is a freakin' _great_ story, poorly presented. Except well-presented 
with all the professionalism of corporate news!  Poorly presented in terms 
of the real economy, real education and real creativity.

Two high school students, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, seniors at 
St. Mary's Academy, _independently_ discovered new proofs of Pythagoras' 
Theorem using only trigonometry.

At 2min in the episode both students claim they were interested in solving 
the bonus question their teacher had given on a test for a monetary prize 
incentive. US\$500. Nothing to sneeze at for high school students. 
But why did CBS have to air that soundbite? Cos' they're neoliberal.

Let me rant a bit about why this was a big deal, before getting to the core 
of this post, which is why the prize incentive was rotten.

## Why such a big deal?

1. Trigonometry (ratios of sides of triangles) --- and nothing more --- had 
not been able to yield a proof of Pythagoras' Theorem for over two thousand 
years, until 
[Jason Zimba in 2007](https://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2009volume9/FG200925.pdf). 
(It is well worth reading that paper, it is an easy read.)
2. Although Calcea and Ne'Kiya were given the puzzle by the same 
teacher, and both knew the other was trying to solve it, they worked 
independently, and each discovered a different new proof.
3. Finding new proofs of old theorems is hard enough itself. (Let alone 
finding one most mathematicians considered impossible.)

### The non-circular proof

For the macroeconomists, let me just say that very, _very_ good mathematicians 
had _[conjectured](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED037335.pdf)_ that 
that a proof of Pythagoras' Theorem using _only_ trigonometry functions would 
be circular, in that it would assume 
$$
\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1
$$
which is of course Pythagoras' Theorem. (You cannot assume in a proof what 
you are trying to prove!)

BTW, I see this a lot in crackpot physics. People often try to derive the 
masses of the elementary particles, but they more often than not have 
implicitly assumed the empirical mass.  For the electron, for example, people 
will take the Compton wavelength as their data.


## The Problem with Prize Money

(And the problem with extrinsic rewards entirely.)

Any decent mathematician would not be solving such a problem for the prize 
money. The effort the students put in was worth far more than US\$500, if 
they had been paid a wage to work on the puzzle. They should have been paid 
to work on it if the money was the goal. But while being paid a wage does 
not mean one is not learning, _not being paid a wage_ should not be the 
price of learning.  The price of learning at school should be the real 
resources going in to teaching and learning. The money should not be a 
question. Just pay the teachers a decent living wage, and hire them locally, 
and hire _all of them_ to cut down the class size ratio.

Prize monies are often like this. Except perhaps for the million dollar 
Clay Millenium Prizes and the Nobel, or Abel. Those bigger prizes recognize 
lifetime achievements, and so are fair compensation for sacrificing a lot to 
work on serious mathematics. For most people they are more than a wage. The 
problem is that they are only a wage for **_one person_** and this degrades 
and demeans the effort of all other people who support the prize winner. 
Anyone ever heard of _standing on the shoulders of giants_?
 
(No? Of course, you're an Ayn Rand acolyte! LOL.)
 

[Alfie Kohn](https://www.alfiekohn.org/), I dare say, would agree with me. 
Twitt3r might not, but I'm no longer involved in that swamp.


### The nuances of wages

I am not saying students should be paid to go to school. That issue is 
entirely different. Public education is an investment. It should be fully 
funded up to available teaching resources. We should not even worry about 
the pay-off, since the pay-off is incalculable, but whatever it is, it 
is yuuuuge!  The private schools like 
[St Maryâ€™s Academy](https://www.stmarys.academy/) need to be crowded out, 
because they are elitist. 

The placements of Calcea and Ne'Kiya are at the school mean other "less 
Catholic" students do not get a place. This is not their fault of course. 
I'm saying it is a systematic problem with private schools. Not only do they 
consume more resources per student than current public schools, the parents 
are paying for these, and they shouldn't be. There is no reason public 
schools cannot be as nice and hygienic as these private schools.  The 
private schools prove the real resources are available.

Sure, sure, admitting less desirable students into the schools messes up the 
pristine learning environment for these gifted kids. That's a whole other 
problem though, for another day. You cannot ignore it though, otherwise you 
give fodder for the elites who demand their kids go to a pristine school if 
they pay the money. I am not trying to skirt this issue, I am just writing 
about a different issue today, the prizes & rewards issue.

Let me just say though, that such elitist claptrap can be defeated if we 
eliminate poverty and allow the riffraff kids to have a dignified living 
environment, a decent breakfast, and parents who are not bitterly struggling 
to survive, who have time to read their children Dr Suess stories, or 
whatever the better stories are... Spike Milligan.

Besides all this, we (society) do pay for children to go to school. We pay 
in terms of the real resources committed to schools --- both private and 
public. As long as we all are paying in real terms, and the teachers 
especially with their labour time, I think we should demand the public 
schools get the premium resources. Will this crowd-out the private schools? 
Yes, I think so, and good riddance.


### What about the motive?

The puzzle solving motive is the only motive the students needed.

Would they then bother to solve the problem?

Who knows? But they did not _need_ the money prize motive. Why not? Because 
they should have been take care of materially, or their parents should have 
been taken care of, with decent wages. 

> Take the money incentive off the table --- unless it is a socially 
necessary sh1t job.

Since solving mathematics puzzle is not a sh1t job, we can, and therefore 
should, take the money off the table, by providing for the students needs, 
by providing for their parents' or guardians' needs.

"But," the pedant asks, "what if the students then did not bother?" I say two 
things to this foolishness:

1. So what? If they did not bother to work on the puzzle then no one dies, 
and they lose out on the chance of discovery. People lose such chances all 
the time. What you do not know you lost will not hurt you.
2. This would more likely than not reveal the students were not truly 
motivated by the money prize, because I bet were finances not an issue 
they'd still have worked on the puzzle. 
3. Everyone is capable of providing their own incentive. If you crack the 
puzzle treat yourself to a movie --- or whatever floats your boat.

(I guess I suck at arithmetic.)

It is a profound lack of creativity to think the students had no motive 
other than the money.

It is a reality they _were in fact_ motivated by the monetary prize, because 
to _them_ US\$500 dollars was a lot of dinero. But that's utterly beside my 
point. 


### But don't wages encrudify labour?

I don't know about that! As I stated, for sh1t jobs wages are bl00dy good. 

For enjoyable jobs we still compensate workers because it is the right 
thing to do, even if the worker is having such a wonderful larking time of 
it they cannot care about the money.  In this case, we${}^\ast$ _take the money off 
the table_ by paying a wage that is fair and just above what the worker 
considers fine enough not to care about the amount and care more about the 
work (enjoyment or utility or both).

(${}^\ast$Who is this "we" you might ask?  I mean the We if I were supreme 
dictator. Or failing that, a simple democracy, full of nasty plebs who 
simply want their fair say in the rules of our society.)

But then the neoliberal wank3r utters, "The wage destroys the competition!"

I mean... sure. With a wage the student can take their own fw33t sucking 
time  trying to crack the mathematics puzzle.

But what student you know would be taking their sw33t a\$\$ time?

None I know. There is always competition in sciences because others can 
discover the thing first, and then you've really cocked it up. Discoveries 
are not like hamburgers, the first one made is the only one made. Unless 
you get lucky and the original hamburger gets lost in the 
<font style="color: #D5B98F">sands of time</font>.

(There is an exception for school pedagogy: it is a great thing to give 
students a solved problem, but get them to try to rediscover a solution. 
There is still a marvellous thrill in this, but it's not the same. However, 
this pedagogical thrill of re-discovery is even more important than original 
discovery, precisely because it is the hamburgers and fries of mathematics 
and science. Feeds the masses.)

But again, it is profound lack of creativity to think students cannot 
motivate themselves when they are waged, or have their financial cares met. 
How would I motivate myself with some pressure? That's so easy, I can think 
of a million ways --- which is to say, the million ways my girlfriend and I 
can achieve orgasm.

What about the teacher wishing to motivate their students?

Well, for heavens sake do not offer a prize.  You can put a deadline on the 
puzzle for "recognition". But even deadlines are for dummies.

You can instead just talk to the students! Shock & horror! Does "talking" 
even work?  I cannot imagine.

> "Hey Calcea and Ne'Kiya, so you like this challenge problem? 
Well, this is a tough one, it might take a long time, much effort, many 
daydreams, and at the end of six months you might get nowhere, like all 
humankind for two thousand years. Except in the process you'll have learned 
so much interesting geometry your brain will swell and your mind will be 
both humbled and proud. Think about that!   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now... do you want to give yourself a 
constraint as a challenge. Say 9 months, but then move on to a new puzzle?"

and then you might say,
> "... look, if you _also_ want some candy as a prize, we've got \$500 from 
the school kitty. That'll get all the chocolate you need for a year. Give 
yourselves that if you crack the puzzle, but work on it because it'll grow 
your mind, not your belly."

But I personally would _not_ add that bit, it's the real enshittification.
Am I a mean & nasty teacher? Maybe. But no student of mine ever told me so.


To be clear, if we are not making whole the families of the students, then 
yeah, would should damn well offer a wage or a prize. For open puzzles I 
prefer a wage, because there is a lot of work to be done, and no guarantee 
of success. But it is a poor system that requires this enshittification. 

The neoliberalization of education cuts deep, and has created a festering 
wound on our society.

("Here kids, work on this and teacher will give you candies, but 
if you cannot solve it then pi55 off, because you deserve the f-all proportion 
of a billion times your present wage.")



## Summary based-MMT Thoughts

(Well... _I_ think they're based. ðŸ˜‚)

Most people are perfectly capable of motivating themselves with scarcity. I do 
it all the time with food --- I will exercise to earn my meal. 
The CBS story reported the high creativity shown by Calcea and Ne'Kiya, 
which is rightly celebrated, but does not stop to ponder how uncreative the 
idea of the monetary prize was, and how insidious.
