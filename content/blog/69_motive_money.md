One of those _feel good stories_ today, and crossing over with my 
mathematics interests.  But you know it!... gonna be tinged with neoliberal 
hate. LOL.

The story was broadcast on 
[CBS 60 Minutes here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHeWndnHuQs)
--- it is a freakin' _great_+ story, poorly presented. Except well-presented 
with all the professionalism of corporate news!

Two high school students, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, seniors at 
St. Mary's Academy, _independently_ discovered new proofs of Pythagoras' 
Theorem using only trigonometry.

At 2min in the episode both students claim they were interested in solving 
the bonus question their teacher had given on a test for a monetary prize 
incentive. US\$500. Nothing to sneeze at for high school students. 
But why did CBS have to air that soundbite? Cos' they're neoliberal.

Let me rant a bit about why this was a big deal, before getting to the core 
of this post, which is why the prize incentive was rotten.

## Why such a big deal?

1. Trigonometry (ratios of sides of triangles) --- and nothing more --- had 
not been able to yield a proof of Pythagoras' Theorem for over a thousand 
years, until 
[Jason Zimba in 2007](https://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2009volume9/FG200925.pdf). 
(It is well worth reading that paper, it is an easy read.)
2. Although Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya were given the puzzle by the same 
teacher, and both knew the other was trying to solve it, they worked 
independently, and each discovered a different new proof.
3. Finding new proofs of old theorems is hard enough itself. (Let alone 
finding one most mathematicians considered impossible.)

### The non-circular proof

For the macroeconomists, let me just say that very, _very_ good mathematicians 
had _[conjectured](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED037335.pdf)_ that 
that Pythagoras' Theorem proof using _only_ trigonometry functions would 
be circular, in that it would assume 
$$
\sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta = 1
$$
which is of course Pythagoras' Theorem. (You cannot assume in a proof what 
you are trying to prove!)

BTW, I see this a lot in crackpot physics. People often try to derive the 
masses of the elementary particles, but they more often than not have 
implicitly assumed the empirical mass, for the electron, for example, people 
will take the Compton wavelength as their data.


## The Problem with Prize Money

(And the problem with extrinsic rewards entirely.)

Any decent mathematician would not be solving such a problem for the prize 
money. The effort the students put in was worth far more than US\$500, if 
they had been paid a wage to work on the puzzle. They should have been paid 
to work on it.  Being paid a wage does not mean one is not learning.

Prize monies are often like this. Except perhaps for the million dollar 
Clay Millenium Prizes and the Nobel, or Abel. Those bigger prizes recognize 
lifetime achievements, and so are fair compensation for sacrificing a lot to 
work on serious mathematics. For most people they are more than a wage. The 
problem is that they are only a wage for **_one person_** and this degrades or 

Alfie Kohn, I dare say, would agree with me. Twitt3r might not, but I'm no 
longer involved in that swamp.


### The nuances of wages

I am not saying students should be paid to go to school. That issue is 
entirely different. Public education is an investment. It should be fully 
funded up to available teaching resources.  The private schools like 
[St Mary's Academy](https://www.stmarys.academy/) need to be crowded out, 
because they are elitist. 

The placements of Calcea and Ne'Kiya are at the school mean other "less 
Catholic"" students do not get a place. This is not their fault of course. 
I'm saying it is a systematic problem with private schools. Not only do they 
consume more resources than public schools, the parents are paying for these, 
and they shouldn't be. There is no reason public schools cannot be as 
nice and hygienic as these private schools.  The private schools prove the 
real resources are available.

Sure, sure, admitting less desirable students into the schools messes up the 
pristine learning environment for these gifted kids. That's a whole other 
problem though, for another day. you cannot ignore it though, otherwise you 
give fodder for the elites who demand their kids go to a pristine school if 
they pay the money. I am not trying to skirt this issue, I am just writing 
about a different issue today, the prizes & rewards issue.

Let me just say though, that such elitist claptrap can be defeated if we 
eliminate poverty and allow the riffraff kids to have a dignified living 
environment, a decent breakfast, and parents who are not bitterly struggling 
to survive, who have time to read their children Dr Suess stories, or 
whatever the better stories are... Spike Milligan.









## Summary based-MMT Thoughts

(Well... _I_ think they're based. ðŸ˜‚)

Most people are perfectly capable of motivating themselves with scarcity. I do 
it all the time with food --- I will exercise to earn my meal. 
The CBS story reported the high creativity shown by Calcea and N''., but 
does not stop to ponder how uncreative the idea of the monetary prize was, 
and how insidious.
