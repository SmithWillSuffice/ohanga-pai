Yes, the US economy is going into recession unless there is some miracle like 
a big fat m.i.c. greasy war to mobilize all the unemployed into Oreshnik 
or Dong Feng-17 fodder. (Only half joking.)

Today, a post that I failed (yet again) to cleanse with linguistic Persil for 
stuff.com friendly suitability.

## What is a 'Crash'?

But no! It is not "crashing". The rhetoric of a "crash" implies some sort of 
unrecoverable disaster, like a global pandemic, or drought, or global warming. 
All of which might happen, but not this year. This is at least not the case 
with the USA this year. The US government has despicably failed to 
guarantee full employment, and has no clue about the reality of monetary 
operations. That's what is killing their economy, scorekeeping, not some 
fundamental economic fragility.  For heavens sake, they have a massive 
labour surplus they seem to not know what to do with! It's an embarrassment 
of riches. Doubly embarrassing since even dirtbag MMT yours truly could think 
of heaps of things their people could be doing to improve the quality of 
life in the USA for everyone.  Forget the rest of their fake-religion 
christofascism. They are just blithering ùïöùëëüÑ∏üÖæùòµS of the highest clerical 
order --- which is bad enough on its own!

Let there be no doubt though, the failure to run proper scorekeeping is 
fundamentally a complete lack of humanity, probably fully fascistic, but at 
least racially prejudiced, and 100% class warfare. What else can it be when 
the fundamental problem _today_ is just bad scorekeeping?

The liberal-neoliberals can at least run the scorekeeping system to not 
cause unemployment and bankruptcies to go to records non-crisis highs. 
I still scratch my head at how effective TEMOTPIH has been at making a 
real goods economic crisis out of simply bad scorekeeping. With the Mars King 
booted out in fairly short order, I'd not have thought it'd go south so 
quickly. Automatic stabilizers and all that --- always usually just enough that 
the suicide rate among the unemployed is "tolerable" in polite upper class 
dinner party circles. 

You surely do not need neocon fascism _at the same time_, but unfortunately 
here you are, and it has ripple effects even down in NZ where our Tories are 
christo-fash emboldened too, and also wrecking our economy, thanks to your 
lead in the USA.

But let's get some perspective on real crash versus fake-crash.

The fake crash is in currency, the fiscal injections "falling off a cliff" 
(going to zero). That's all Deficit Myth driven stuff, the US Democrats might have 
acknowledged MMT, but they are too chicken-Íï∑ÍñæÍïØÍñ° to admit it for fear of 
losing donors. They'd sacrifice low paid workers and the unemployed instead, 
and we should always remember the calculus, it benefits them if the economy 
tanks under the GOP. ("See, we're the 'fiscal responsible ones' Mr Business 
lobby!" --- they [if not full Clintonite nutcases] proceed to turn back on 
the fiscal injections, but never enough to eliminate unemployment.)

Why would the centrist Neoliberals eliminate unemployment? No good reason huh, 
since the working class are no longer their "base". The working class have 
no government representation at present, not anywhere. not even from Lula in 
Brazil.   Talk about _taxation without representation!_ It's at obscene levels 
not seen since the War of Independence.

"Why is a Kiwi writing so much about the USA?", I hear you ask? The answer is 
because what the USA does has poodles like NZ neoliberals following in the 
fart streams.

Anyway, this post was to spit out my comments on a ridiculous Kyle Kulinski 
fearstream.

To be fair, he's not wrong the GOP _are_ screwing things up mightily, but 
Kulinski's reasoning was still all backwards, as hard as it is to fathom. My 
thinking is if he said it all correctly, it would spell _a lot worse_ than his 
pronouncements, because it is not going to be a "crash", it will just be more 
long suffering seemingly without end. _Never Let a Crisis Go to Waste_.

The Democrats will come into power and spew, "We have to suck it up and 
tighten our belts thanks to Trump's GOP, blame them!"  Blame them for 
poor scorekeeping, but not yourselves???

But... yeah... _this time_ it could be different (as I acknowledged in my 
last post). We will see.  And not before too long. But even if TEMOTPIH fails 
to create a real crash, rather than just a financial crash, it does not ever 
make the pain felt by working families and the unemployed (through no fault 
of their own) any less horrific.

## Korrekting Kulinski

**Part-1.** of _Couple of corrections [to Kulinksi]_:

**(a)** Your economy is not yet 
crushed, your farmers can still grow soybeans, your trouble is US citizens do 
not want to eat them all. Trade is about getting as many imports for as few 
exports as possible. Your exports are your real loss, not your benefit (the 
Chinese firms buying soybeans cannot make US$, in fact they tend to save in 
US Treasuries, a demand withdrawal which provides more fiscal space for US 
government spending). The problem is, your government is not filling that 
currency vacuum, the evidence is unemployment. Read The Deficit Myth --- no, I 
mean actually read it this time!

**(b)**  Your export farm lobby is really an enemy of the USA, their interest 
is in the foreign buyer, and lower domestic wages. A farm policy should 
instead be 90% domestic, feed your own people first.  Not just with soybeans, 
grow some other crops. Whatever excess you produce there is always a foreign 
buyer, at some price, e.g., farm starved nations. Give them a discount, it's 
the humane thing to do in trade (which is more often "the opposite of 
religion, better to receive than to give.")


**Part-2.** foreign trade is not your problem fundamentally, you trade to get 
nice imports, not to export (which fuels your export oligarchs, the enemies 
of the nation, their interest is in suppressing domestic wages).  Your problem 
is drying up of fiscal injections (aka. the "governemtn deficit"). That's what 
is killing you. Not the excess soybeans (grow other crops for domestic sale).

The Gov Deficit is dollar-for-dollar the non-government sector surplus. You 
want that higher, not lower. If your population grows you want the accumulated 
debt therefrom to grow with population size, not shrink, just to support 
existing prices, even before inflation from interest rate hikes (the interest 
rate is the base inflation rate, through term structure of prices faced by 
consumers and contracts today.)

((While old hat MMT, this stuff cannot be repeated often enough!))

The "government debt" is the net money supply, i.e., non-government sector tax 
credits, by accounting identity, with a growing population is should naturally 
rise over time, indefinitely. It always can, it's just scorekeeping (no gold 
is at stake, no grandkids held to ransom).


## More Stuff that Cannot Be Repeated Enough

**Part-3.** The "rush into gold" is not into gold, it is into gold securities 
(pieces of paper). No one seriously ships or receives any gold metal${}^\dagger$, 
if they all tried together there'd be blood at Fort Knox. 

${}^\dagger$  except a few with metallic yellow colour fetishes. The gold 
prices always reverts to the mean, and that is a price dictated by government 
policy, it cannot be otherwise, since the numeraire is still the "$", and the 
monopoly issuer of "$" sets the exchange value of the "" scorepoint, whether 
they know it or not. (They do not know it.)

While Kulinski is guilty of fearstreaming, I think my take on things is even 
more terrifying. Kulinski's problem is his solutions (tax the corporations, 
tax, tax, tax, export, export, export...) are nuts, backwards, and obscenely 
regressive. Anti-worker. And yet he has no clue about it! He's not trying to 
be regressive, quit ethe opposite. Hence why I have more justification to 
shake with fear than he does. Peter Thiel will be in New Zealand permanent 
before too long ñ°Æñ¶ôÍö∂ñ•êñ¢âñ•£ÍõòÍõ™ us up instead of you guys.

Luckily Kulinski fearstreaming was shortish, so that's all I have in response 
for now. But he and Krystal Ball are forever shooting the working class in 
the head with their social influencer, "me tax dollar paid for it" nonsense. 
God (the actual unkowable entity) help us all!  Along with Richard Wolff, they're 
enabling the fasicists _and_ libertarians at the same time! Quite some feat 
for people who like to think of themselves as anti-fascist!
