Currency pegging runs deep.

This week I critique Bill Mitchell's initial framing of monetary systems 
on a recent 
[Macro and Cheese podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5OLxWhtGgQ) 
episode [#308](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5OLxWhtGgQ).


Although Bill doesn't know me from Adam, I am Internet pals with Grumbine 
and appreciate his efforts at Real Progressive more than any other podcast 
or public education platform in the world. So there's that. If I fire at 
them it is intended as constructive criticism. I am not even angry with Bill. 
Just depressed.

I also **_fully realize_** in the court of leftiepol public opinion I am 
probably the bad guy here. No one wants to know the state currency is a 
simple public monopoly and has never in all history been a 
"commodity currency".

I am not even being "edgy" here. I am merely being highly autistic, since 
that's what I am. I am not out to generate clicks and Likes or Followers. 
So take all that I write at face value and assess it for yourself. If it is 
a useful alternative framing to fake "MMT Marxism" then that's good.
It does not detract one iota from Bill's more important messaging: 

> _the working class get their lives _needlessly_ ruined under capitalist 
modes of production._

That's just fact.

As I've written before, you do not have to be an ideological socialist or 
marxist or right-wing edge lord to know capitalism is an unjust system 
and _has to go!_

## Nope, Money has Never Been Commodity

This is a tad too simplistic, but I define a commodity as something that 
gets consumed or degraded for use in production.  Gold is a commodity 
because when used in production it _very slowly_  disintegrates. The time 
scale is so slow that it looks like a mere intermediate. But you cannot run 
space technology radiation shielding without microscopic loss of 
gold atoms. 

Mere semantics you say? I say not. By the end of this essay I hope you 
realize that is is class warfare against the working class to frame the 
State monetary systems as _ever_ having been commodities money.

I wrote this comment:

> @10:00 what's happened with Bill? You never concede a false principle. 
State money has never been _commodity money._ Not even in Marx's day. It has 
always functioned as a tax credit (generalizing the meaning of "tax" 
sufficiently, but not so much that stealing and plundering gold is a "tax" 
lol). I guess he is trying to simplify things so a dumb-dumb marxist can 
listen without having an aneurysm? The distinction is clear: what does the 
state currency redeem for? It was never for gold. On paper the currencies 
at some times could be swapped for gold certificates, and sometimes bullion. 
But what the currency exchanges for does not _define_ the currency. What 
defines the unit of account is what the issuer _ultimately_ promises to 
redeem.  When they run out of gold they stop redeeming for gold 
and _always_ continue redeeming for tax liabilities, if not they have 
ceased being the government. The tax driven currency has _always_ been 
the ultimate.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can say there have been eras where 
a *_commodity peg_* has been used. But that is very far from being a 
literal "commodity money". On a peg what you look at is _still_ the 
scorepoints in your bank account, not a pile of gold.

I think I know what Bill is trying to do, or part of it. There is a need 
to get marxist-socialists fully on board with MMT. If for no other reason 
they tend to be much nicer kinder people than the right-wing MAGA commie 
crowd${}^\dagger$. So you don't want to piss them off by telling 
them K. Marx was an 
idiot about monetary operations. I have no such qualms though, I don't 
think any band of marxist-socialists is going to overthrow Neoliberal 
capitalism, though they may certainly help in the effort --- once they 
understand basic monetary macroeconomics.

${}^\dagger$We desperately need nice kind people in leftiepol spaces, who 
are not bashing the garden variety working class stiff over the head with 
pseudo-woke carry-on. Intersectionality is good: there is no decent 
social justice without working class justice.

I had to add this:

> BTW, I regard the proper tax driven currency story as the proper and 
true story, and the truth matters. So you can placate an aggressive 
marxist/socialist as much as you like by discussing commodity pegs, I have 
no problem with that, but you are anti-socialist and anti-worker if you 
peddle the false narrative of a pure commodity currency.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in small localities, or feudal 
cliques, where people literally transported metals or grains or whatever 
around to intermediate trading of goods, it was still not a commodity 
currency. It was a fancy poker chip. Everyone understood the debt/credit 
relation, which is a scorepoint accounting unit relation.

Don't make up white lies to placate lefties, you do not _need_ to. If they 
are good, honest kind people they'll sooner rather than later grok MMT.
If they are not honest and wise then there's no point fibbing to them to 
make them happier about MMT. Realpolitik notwithstanding.

This is _also_ why the TYT network pivot to the alt-right is not going 
to help. They may gain some right-wing rich funders, and help propagate 
a pseudo class conscious plebian right-wing sympathy for the working class, 
and Bernie-crat style politics. A lot on the right-wing favour 
Medicare For All, for instance. But as long as they think they need to get 
the currency to "pay for" it off the billionaires they will fail in their 
ultimate efforts to actually get such policy through the government.

The government representatives (I no longer call them "leaders" since 
that's just plain false) will not vote to pass higher government 
investment if they think they have to tax the rich to pay for it. You need 
to tell these assholes whom the unwashed masses keep voting into office that 
the increased government spending will make rich people richer (in nominal 
terms, but it's ok to leave that bit out!). You need to tell the lefties 
and pseudo-woke liberals that increased government spending will also make 
poor people richer too, and in _real terms_ if not (sadly) also in nominal 
terms.

Then we can start getting to work on reducing the excess purchasing power 
the billionaire and investor class have and are not using. We do not need 
to tax it all off them, but just motivate them to spend the rets of the 
scorepoints. “If you do not spend, we will tax.” How? By running ever 
higher government deficits to fill the spending gap (the evidence for 
which is unemployment). The Seventh of the 7 Deadly Innocent 
Frauds: _increased deficits today means higher taxes tomorrow_. Myth being 
that this is a bad thing, when the fact is that it is a good thing.

Do we need to mention the time is short on "getting to work" on this? 
Because when it is over the work is not yet done. When that heavy lifting is 
done we can get to work starting to avoid ecological catastrophes and 
the like. And avoid people blaming "MMT" on the shut down of the AMOC.

Let me be clear. "Capitalism" is not "money & markets"". Money & markets 
are good things. Capitalism qua Marx is the _class relation_ were a few 
people are bosses who do not work to eat, and the majority are wage slaves 
who need to beg for employment to eat.

Expanded public sector services and a Job Guarantee (totally different 
things) eliminate Capitalism qua Marx. We do not have to do anything else 
to destroy capitalism. If the State stands always ready to hire you for 
public purpose at a decent living wage, then you are no longer begging for 
private sector employment, and you've undone Capitalism.

You can still work for a boss if you like, many will, but it is now more
voluntary. The private firm has to make things pretty nice for you to hire 
you out of the public sector during your 9am to 5pm. Although, if public 
services are expanded, non-bullshit, then it is probably 11am to 3pm.
The more people honestly working the less hours any one person needs 
to work.

There may still be all sorts of other injustices here and there, like 
racism and gender discrimination and disability discrimination, but let's 
deal with those _as well_! It is not "let's deal with them later."

I die a little inside every time I see some youtube Influencer ranting 
about the threat of an AI Singularity. Like that is the very least of the 
problems I see, it's a fake problem.

[One professional thinking person guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL0y3WCCvpU) was even thinking (if you can call it that) the real threat is 
from dumbing people down. Again... that's the least of my worries. If you 
want an Ai to do all your trickier cognitive work for you, then you should 
get Ai to do all your harder cognitive work for you, that leaves you free 
to do more useful kinetic things like take care of young and elderly people 
who can't do the muscle work of changing their own clothes and things like 
that. If you truly need an Ai to tell you how to make up a fresh bed, then 
it is only you who are doomed, not human civilization. Don't watch so many 
scifi dystopia movies.  Or if you do, understand the meaning 
of "Cautionary Tale". It is a Tale.

What I wrote to that un-Thinking philosopher person was that the true 
challenge is spiritual struggle, not nerdy intellectual struggle.

Besides, have you ever tried dumbing down an _actual_ nerd? It's like 
trying to flatten a balloon without popping it. If an Ai can solve a puzzle, 
the nerd will still try to solve it unless it is a brute force hack.
And we (society) are all that much better and resilient for this redundancy 
in puzzle solvers.
