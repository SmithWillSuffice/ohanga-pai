A hobby project I keep procrastinating on is to stick some free-libre software 
onto github to give people some toys to play with for running 
Dr«égulesc--Yakovenko--Ispolatov (DYI) economic exchange models. This topic deserves 
a theory/empirical chapter, but today I just have time to write some 
commentary for more popular consumption.

## Gold Distribution?

Oh yeah, the "gold maldistribution" is clickbait for the libertarians. In 
case any of them might still chance across ≈åhanga Pai by a one in a million 
chance.ü§£  The rest of us are talking about scorepoints in T accounts.

I do often worry about **_real_** wealth distribution, but the thing is, in a 
monetary economy the real wealth effects are secondary to nominal wealth. If 
you have the scorepoints you can get the type of real wealth you prefer. 
Without the scorepoints you will not get he real wealth you desire, or will 
be in debt to  bank.

The brain twister for normies is that surely **_real_** wealth is primary, it 
is what truly matters, how can it be secondary? The MMT response should be 
"Yes! Real wealth is primary and *is* what truly matters!" --- but in a 
monetary economy there is a sequence. You want to get the nominal 
scorepoints *first* (to avoid bank debt). Then you can get the gold you want 
to digest and grow libertarian fairies and leprechauns upon.

((Whoa! Something is wrong. I spelt "leprechauns" correct first time, pure 
keyboard hits.))

## Exchange TOy Models

Today a few notes that came into my mind from listening to 
[Dr Yonatan Berman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7j4eO4Kbls) 
talking about non-egodicity in macroeconomics. The models he was using like 
*reallocating geometric brownian motion* seemed a little reminiscent of the 
DYI econophysics models. They are useful toy models.

But the point to playing with them is to understand what the world should 
**_not_** be like, not why the world is like it is.  The backwards thinking 
came to ear when Berman mentioned his model his "reallocation parameter" 
$\tau$ "does not capture any specific policy". A correct statement. But then 
all that means is the model is truly a toy model and unable to usefully inform 
government policy. I guess that's what you call a libertarian's *realistic* 
model. üòÇ

My comment:
> @9:30 "... this is important for the interpretation..." right, and yet 
because it is _not_ modeled as _due to policy_ you've got a very unrealistic 
model _for a single currency macroeconomy._ .  All nations outside the EMU are 
currency monopolies, the state currency is a _simple_ public monopoly. Granted 
no one in power seems to know this, or if they do they obscure their knowledge. 
But it does give us, anyone who does know the monetary system operations, how 
to eliminated _nominal_ poverty overnight. Then your model changes 
dramatically, and you can have a policy that permits any nominal wealth 
distribution whatsoever.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caveat is the nation needs to be on 
an exchange rate _*float*_ --- which makes all the difference, because then 
there is no need for the mainstream econ fixed exchange rate mentality (which 
gets the interest rate and unemployment "trade off" stories backwards).  My 
point being that *_policy_* matters, it matters enormously, far more than any 
"free market" economics bro can imagine. To put none too fine a point on it, 
there is no need whatsoever for _any_ involuntary unemployment or nominal 
poverty. Nor does government policy to eliminate all unemployment and nominal 
poverty risk inflation --- the risk of inflation would be when on a fixed 
exchange rate. On a floating exchange rate, with full employment policy like 
a Job Guarantee (0% unemployment with a small transitory fraction), the risk 
is fewer imports, or need to export more to pay for the imports, in other 
words, that's a domestic redistribution issues, which government policy can 
also address (who gets to play more golf, who gets to work longer in the 
factory).

What about using macroeconomic models for public good?  I wrote a follow-up:
> I am saying your modelling efforts are nice for pedagogy, but I hope you 
also can better understand macroeconomics and run realistic model that inform 
wise and humane government policy. I am not a na√Øve idealist in thinking 
governments will take heed, the neoliberals probably will not, but it is a 
moral responsibility and serves public purpose to at least inform government 
representatives of the better policy options available. If they choose 
anti-worker policies that's on their conscience, and hopefully will see them 
get voted out of office too. For this latter effect, you must also educate 
the general public. Not just fellow academics.
