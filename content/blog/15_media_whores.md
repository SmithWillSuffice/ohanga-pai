I furore broke out in the right-wing media space recently, with some guy named "Crowder" attacking the "Jewish last name" right-wing media host by the name of Shapiro. Shapiro apparently was offering Crowder a $\\$50$ million contract over 4 years, but which had payments reduced if YouTube banned Crowder or if Crowder lost advertisers.

So what apparently happened is Crowder goes on some rant explaining how the Jewish side of the right-wing media is in league with "Big tech" and is out to stiff humble young millionaires like Crowder from getting their natural rights to the ad funds and billionaire oligarchs who fund right-wing media.

All a bit hilarious and sad.

A breadtube commentator did a segment on this. It was fine, clickbait for the 
leftists who enjoy seeing right-wing cannibalism for a change (there's already 
enough of that on "the left" --- fake leftists since a true leftists would know 
about solidarity).

Anyway, what finally triggered me to comment on this breadtuber's channel was his 
comment at the end where he says, 

> "... money is power under capitalism."

The implication being a truism that billionair funding of right-wing media is 
thoroughly out of control, which means a very few voices in media spaces get way out 
of proportion  views and clicks. Advertising and marketing isa blunt weapon for 
getting views, but the statistics work well enough if you cna throw a few million 
away lick pocket change.

I took exception like a true MMT nerd though. Not to the point about the distortion of 
media spaces, but to the false view of money.

> The ÅŒhanga Pai take: "Not quite right. Money is purchasing power under **_any_**
system, even anarchism (money is an IOU of the issuer). Under capitalism the ability 
to hoard currency by exploiting workers is the accumulation of unearned power. That's 
what is out of control under capitalism, but moreso neoliberal capitalism which 
breaks Marx's concept of capitalism being a revolutionary self-defeating force. (The 
neoliberal state bails out capitalist firms, quite regularly.).

I will not imagine any sympathetic leftists, but if anyone's a true leftist 
(fighting for emancipation of the working class) they should give my little comment 
a like. It is simply a lot harder to defeat the injustices of actual existing capitalism 
if you do not understand the monetary system. Governments do not need rich people to 
exist. A government of and for the people can always fund any alternative media the 
public has the appetite for, which means not driven by views, likes and clicks, but 
by constraints of accuracy, non-partisanship and truth. That requires good media 
ombundsmen --- publicly appointed, not partisan politically appointed.

We are nowhere near that even in humble egalitarian little New Zealand. Our public 
media is good on being seemingly reasonably non-partisan, but it is still infested with 
neoliberal brainworms. So NZ public media is in fact highly partisan, violating the 
purpose of publicly funded news media, since they present an entirely neoliberal 
worldview, we've got left-wing neoliberalism, centrist neoliberalism and right-wing 
neoliberalism in our public news stations. A lot like YouTube and Twitter only 
without the billionaire supported ultra right-wing. It's a buffet selection of all 
varieties of worms.

You have to be hopeful though, as a working class grunt. 

When it takes billionaires to support your rich-kid fake-populist content, you know 
you're actually losing in cultural terms, it's just hard for you to see it that way, 
since you're blinded by the cash. 

I will not disagree with you in-the-know MMT'ers if you think it is all a bit 
depressing. I just know the Crowder's and Shapiro's of the media landscape have 
the charisma of wet rags to me, so I will infer the same to many others, so we know 
their ideas are not the reason they're raking in the profits, it's their billionaire 
daddies.
