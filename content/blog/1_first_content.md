After years of dithering and pussy footing around about where to publish my [economic justice writing,](/ohanga-pai/questions/) I settled on this github repository... because... [free-libre](www.gnu.org) nerd.

I'm not out to build a following or anything like that, but just want activist-geeks (a non-vanishing class of people) to have some decent software to use that won't be a perennial pain-in-the you-know-what for GNU+Linux users to install (last version of [Minsky](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/) would not build from tarball nor run even when installed successfully from the Debian repo --- I think ProfKeen and hpcoder have achieved code bloat). 

Here at ÅŒhanga Pai we're going to aim for clean and lean code that a high school student can profitably hack in a day to get something useful running.

Since I'm getting old, these days I prefer writing to software development, which is why this website is first up as live ahead of the software. 
Don't worry though, I will eventually get the software up online too.
Stay tuned. Or not.

Unless I get some magical following of more than a few hundred hackers there will be no Discord or other social media chat room, which are time sinks. 
Email will suffice (and is less an [energy time](https://medium.com/@theorypleeb/timenergy-an-existential-analysis-of-labor-power-5fc5b0071452) sink).
If you have a contribution then post it, or clone the repo if you have a rationale for a major branch.
