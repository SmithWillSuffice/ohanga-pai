Yeah, nah! maybe a big "no" to electric cars? 

Not so fast.

[Sabine Hossenfelder was vlogging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX2n2-acksw) about her change of opinion on electric vehicles. She prefers Hybrids now. You are welcome to watch the 
[whole episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX2n2-acksw), but today all 
I wanted to do was to address the "enormous costs" scare-mongering.


## Noeoelectric

Not a typo. It's a *word blende* I'm inventing, something like a mix of 
"no electic", "neo-electric" and "noosphere" (the latter a Teilhard de Chardin concept for collective growing up y'all). 

((Also, I prefer "word blende" to "word blend", the latter reminds me too much of the, "But will it blend?" guy, who is too hilarious.))

Hossenfelder does the same hysteria when speaking about big physics.  Not 
that she is wrong entirely, the real resource cost is fairly large, but 
she over-dramatizes,, because she focuses, like a  good little neoliberal, 
on the monetary costs. The real resource costs for a Superconducting 
Supercollider would not be all that much, pretty insignificant, and 
certainly not an inflation risk. More to the point, not a starvation risk. 
An SSC is not going to put farmers or builders out of business.

So I made my comments:
> @0:48 one thing you neoliberals need to understand (and change your 
mind about "obviously") is that _the monetary cost is irrelevant_ for a 
currency issuing monopoly (government, or in the EMU case the ECB). The 
cost for governments is always and *_only_* in *_real terms._* Every 
state mandated project must take real resources out of the private sector 
to employ them in the public sector. A nation faces two choices: 
(1) either wait interminably long for the private sector to provide 
for-profit green transport, or (2) make it a public priority. If (2) then 
it can be done easily provided the _real resources_ are available. It would 
not be a question of finding the money. Governments create the currency, 
by computer entries. The problem here is purely political. Neoliberals do 
not accept the reality of state currency operations, they believe in the 
"private market" as a "wealth creator". (True in real terms, false in 
currency terms.)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course "obviously" a third 
possibility is available. (3) Government can always provide the financial 
incentives to private industry to produce the environmentally friendly 
transport systems. Why? Because as I said, they have no problem issuing the 
currency, it's literally scorepoints on a ledger (aka. tax credits). And how? 
Either by contracting or subsidy. The idea here would be to have decent 
oversight, so there is no free corporate welfare or cronyism. The subsidies, 
or contracts, need to be for public purpose, not private profit. The private 
owner of the contracted companies should be held accountable to the public, 
and use of Limited Liability legislation has to have a quid pro quo: which is 
a democratic workplace for any company seeking government contracts or 
subsidies.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neoliberal/libertarian governments will 
never do any of this. We gotta get rid of them somehow.


## Wrecking the Power Grid?

One argument against mass conversion to electric vehicles is the 
disruption to power grids. This is probably a fair enough worry.

But what about mass public transport, with dedicated power, so not "on the 
grid"? Am I mad, or do neoliberals profoundly lack imagination?

I think they lack imagination by design, since their whole shtick is to 
allow the free market to sort it out, where "it" is basically any problem. 
Including getting votes in parliament I presume.ðŸ˜‚

Having said that, we are electricity constrained, so any such share of 
electric power generation for public transport has to be capacity we build. 
It'll likely not work logistically or politically to sequester existing 
power utility output for mass public transport.

Sadly too, I think this is a political issue, not a real resource 
constraint. Politicians cannot lift a finger to vote for mass electrified 
public transport until the greater majority of the public are content to 
ditch their private transport vehicles. Almost makes one wish for a 
benevolent
