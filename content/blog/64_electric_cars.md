Yeah, nah! maybe a big "no" to electric cars? 

Not so fast.

[Sabine Hossenfelder was vlogging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX2n2-acksw) about her change of opinion on electric vehicles. She prefers Hybrids now. You are welcome to watch the 
[whole episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX2n2-acksw), but today all 
I wanted to do was to address the "enormous costs" scare-mongering.


## Noeoelectric

Not a typo. It's a *word blende* I'm inventing, something like a mix of 
"no electic", "neo-electric" and "noosphere" (the latter a Teilhard de Chardin concept for collective growing up y'all). 

((Also, I prefer "word blende" to "word blend", the latter reminds me too much of the, 
[“But will it blend?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P4_JM0RGGE&pp=ygURYnV0IHdpbGwgaXQgYmxlbmQ%3D) guy, who is too 
freakin' hilarious. A hidden comedic talent of, "how come your 
channel doesn't have a million subscribers," worthiness.))

Hossenfelder does the same hysteria when speaking about big physics.  Not 
that she is wrong entirely, the real resource cost is fairly large, but 
she over-dramatizes,, because she focuses, like a  good little neoliberal, 
on the monetary costs. The real resource costs for a Superconducting 
Supercollider would not be all that much, pretty insignificant, and 
certainly not an inflation risk. More to the point, not a starvation risk. 
An SSC is not going to put farmers or builders out of business.

So I made my comments:
> @0:48 one thing you neoliberals need to understand (and change your 
mind about "obviously") is that _the monetary cost is irrelevant_ for a 
currency issuing monopoly (government, or in the EMU case the ECB). The 
cost for governments is always and *_only_* in *_real terms._* Every 
state mandated project must take real resources out of the private sector 
to employ them in the public sector. A nation faces two choices: 
(1) either wait interminably long for the private sector to provide 
for-profit green transport, or (2) make it a public priority. If (2) then 
it can be done easily provided the _real resources_ are available. It would 
not be a question of finding the money. Governments create the currency, 
by computer entries. The problem here is purely political. Neoliberals do 
not accept the reality of state currency operations, they believe in the 
"private market" as a "wealth creator". (True in real terms, false in 
currency terms.)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course "obviously" a third 
possibility is available. (3) Government can always provide the financial 
incentives to private industry to produce the environmentally friendly 
transport systems. Why? Because as I said, they have no problem issuing the 
currency, it's literally scorepoints on a ledger (aka. tax credits). And how? 
Either by contracting or subsidy. The idea here would be to have decent 
oversight, so there is no free corporate welfare or cronyism. The subsidies, 
or contracts, need to be for public purpose, not private profit. The private 
owner of the contracted companies should be held accountable to the public, 
and use of Limited Liability legislation has to have a quid pro quo: 
which is a democratic workplace for any company seeking government 
contracts or 
subsidies.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neoliberal/libertarian governments will 
never do any of this. We gotta get rid of them somehow.

Another comment was necessary:
> @2:30 this is madness. You have not done the research Sabine, or are 
parroting macroeconomic ignorance. The private sector cannot create currency. 
It'd be illegal (counterfeit). (They could spend what they hoarded, but good 
luck getting the capitalists to release their hoards of bank scorepoints for 
public purpose.) Banks can issue credit which can circulate for a while, but 
in all nations outside the EMU the government is the sole source of fresh 
currency, and by keystrokes. No tax-payer is needed. Tax payments are a 
redemption operation, driving _demand_ for the currency, not a funding 
operation.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector *_can_* supply the 
needed *_real resources_* --- workers primarily, and whatever equipment the 
corporates own, they can always be contracted for public purpose use, at a 
fair price, hence no inflation. If they ask a higher price the government 
can choose to tax them --- but not the "get the money" rather to release the 
real resources. (That's the purpose of a tax, to move *_real_* resources from 
the private sector into the public sector.) The government immediately issues 
the currency that is needed to pay the tax once the corporation is willing to 
put Its resources to use for public purpose. That's called the state hiring 
the unemployed resources it just created by imposing the tax, eliminating 
the unemployment It generated.


### Eliminating Bullsh$\ast$t Jobs

People will often complain about how idealistic youth are desire a "greener"
economy. A typical reaction might be, "You can't just have free range 
chickens,big farming must grow the food or millions starve, so just be 
realistic."

"Be realistic". Fine words. But all too often I worry they conceal total 
lack of imagination. In such cases it really is heterological. (Chickens is 
just one of many examples.)  Bullsh$\ast$t jobs are both another example, and 
the general case for a solution.

People (I mean neoliberals) might, for instance, complain: Well, we cannot 
just eliminate bullsh$\ast$t jobs, what else would people do?"

The answer is, raise free range chickens of course! 

There is no end of good things people can do which are not getting done. There 
are about 40% of wasted human lives living in bullsh$\ast$t jobs who could be 
doing those good things, and another 20% of people who are able to work can
willing who cannot find employment. You do the math.

How can we eliminate all unemployment and all bullsh$\ast$t jobs? 
Fill up an infinitesimal fraction of the endless list of jobs people could 
be doig which are not getting done.

Hilbert the Roosters Hotel. (Is what I am calling it.)


## Wrecking the Power Grid?

One argument against mass conversion to electric vehicles is the 
disruption to power grids. This is probably a fair enough worry.

But what about mass public transport, with dedicated power, so not "on the 
grid"? Am I mad, or do neoliberals profoundly lack imagination?

I think they lack imagination by design, since their whole shtick is to 
allow the free market to sort it out, where "it" is basically any problem. 
Including getting votes in parliament I presume.😂

Having said that, we are electricity constrained, so any such share of 
electric power generation for public transport has to be capacity we build. 
It'll likely not work logistically or politically to sequester existing 
power utility output for mass public transport.

The IEA estimate is the electric grid (in a nation) needs to expand about 
25% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous decade. 
Hossenfelder scare-mongers about this being diabolically hard to impossible. 
But any MMT understanding would say it could be easy. If the problem is not 
insufficient real resources, then it is not an economic nor monetary 
problem, it is a political problem.

What if you *en masse* in your country just don't like public transport? 
For you Lithuanians, private electric transition the estimate is that the 
USA and Europe would need to double investment to upgrade the grid 
to allow private electric vehicle infrastructure. Probably the same for 
Lithuanian then. But... oh no, what tax payers will want to fund this? 🤣

Maybe the real resources for 25% extension of the electric grid are 
insufficient at present for a 10 year extension, but we do have the 
resources. the problem is the rate of build. If that is the real constraint, 
then "obviously" governments will need to apply other measures, like 
rationing existing electricity, or employing alternative public transport 
systems in a transition period. Burn more fossil to eliminate fossil.

That is to say, eliminate oil for transport. We cannot eliminate oil for 
vital chemical industries... without going a little bit luddite. Not that 
I'm opposed to a bit of luddite return to "nature", I just cannot muster 
up extremist alarmism about it. Sorry. Why not? Because I do not think it 
is necessary. 

Here I am firmly in the Warren Mosler camp of environmentalism. We can 
easily reduce and cut-back on non-essentials, without giving up Netflix, 
golf and hamburgers. There are sooo many bullsh$\ast$t job workers no one 
needs, and so much consumer crap no one seriously needs. We need to learn to 
give up such wasteful banalities. I do not think it requires extreme luddite 
tendency. From the Mosler camp, we'd use the COVID pandemic lock-downs as 
illustrative. It cleared the pollution, in a matter of weeks, in major 
cities. No one died as a result of *that*, and the lesson is, we can have 
consumer lock-downs by volunteer, provided government employs people in 
non-bullsh$\ast$t work for public good purpose. Such jobs do not have to be 
higher energy consuming. This is what normies and neoliberals just do not 
understand. Libertarians are worse, they think lock-downs are evil. They'd 
be right if the purpose was to cause mass unemployment. So we should not 
make this the purpose.

((NB: I'd have to consider myself a normie if I had not bothered to 
understand MMT. Being a mathematical physicist is not a ticket out 
of normiehood. ))

Employing people for public good purpose is of course not a lock-down. 
What to call the policy? I do not have a fancy phrase. But the idea is to 
give workers a simple choice. Just publish the data showing the industries 
that are the major polluters, and those which produce non-essentials. Then 
give the workers the choice to quit their jobs, and work instead for the 
public purpose. Give people the choice.

Just think about it at least, you politicians. Maybe fast-food will 
survive?  Cooking up hamburgers and fries is energy intensive, but we 
have to eat to survive, and a fast-food join with scale can produce more 
burgers with less overall energy than a household, probably. The massive 
energy wasters are elsewhere, I am almost certain. Server farms doing 
nothing but advertising. Tax attorneys trying to defeat the tax code. 
Server farms grinding out useless computations for driving
crypto(non)currency. The proliferation of wild west artificial neural 
net scams and data mining for-profit and scamming. Lot;s of low hanging 
rotten fruit we can cull, terrwatts of bullsh$\ast$t work.

I don't think cattle farmers are the evil guys.

Back to the question of using real resources for sustainable energy 
generation transition...

Sadly too, I think this is a political issue, not a real resource 
constraint. Politicians cannot lift a finger to vote for mass electrified 
public transport until the greater majority of the public are content to 
ditch their private transport vehicles. Almost makes one wish for a 
benevolent 
[Authoritarian overlord](../62_n-body_problems)! 🤣


## Democracy is Pain to 11

On that latter point. One might be moved to be half-serious. 
I'm not one of them. It's worth the pain. Just my opinion.

You could argue millions fewer would die under a benign authoritarian 
rule, but the trouble is I just think benevolent authoritarianism is 
psychologically impossible. People with that much power are corrupt.

To be non-corrupt, "the people" have to grant monopoly power to a body, 
and have the power to remove that power, preferably not invested in one 
person either. But then that looks a lot like a democracy, and all the 
hurt that comes with it. 

If we could engineer a benevolent overlord, then I might say, 
reluctantly, "ok, fine, you got me." I just think it's not possible, so 
why waste the effort to try such political engineering? I can see it doing 
a lot of harm in the effort, because it invites zealotry. You know *that* 
never works out well, the Zionist project was such a thing. Like 
South African Apartheid, both engineered social systems. Both backed by 
the idea one type of people, defined by birth, knows best.

It is not that benevolent authoritarianism is pain less than 9, but that 
in attempting to engineer such a social system the pain would go to 22.
With no guarantee of dropping back to 9. Just my guess. God help us in not 
having to live it to prove me right.
