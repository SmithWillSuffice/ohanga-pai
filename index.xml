Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy and fiscal versus monetary policy. For public banking (really just banking in general) I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn heavily upon the prior work of Warren Mosler, Randall Wray, and Eric Tymoigne.
For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and Bill Mitchell &amp;amp; Pavlina Tcherneva . For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon Money on the Left and Stephanie Kelton @Market Watch.</description></item><item><title>Dithering No More</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/01_first_content/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/01_first_content/</guid><description>After years of dithering and pussy footing around about where to publish my economic justice writing, I settled on this github repository&amp;hellip; because&amp;hellip; free-libre nerd.

They are agent-based models, and show the basic wealth distributions that occur generically given some rules for how entities (individuals or units like small firms) exchange assets.
These models are great for thinking about fair distribution policies, which at a government regulatory level means fiscal policy. The models show that highly unfair wealth distributions naturally occur even when asset exchanges are uniform and random.</description></item><item><title>Basic MMT and Economic Justice</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/</guid><description>For most of this whole course on MMT I am going to use the example of New Zealand, since many people claim MMT only applies to a country like the USA which enjoys a global reserve currency status. This would be false. MMT applies perfectly well to a small open economy like New Zealand. The currency is the NZD.
The Bare Minimum If you have a very sharp mind and keen intelligence you can almost derive answers to most of the basic questions concerning state currency monopoly systems (which would describe most monetary systems in all major countries today) using the principles in the following four subsections:</description></item><item><title>Neural Net Predictors</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/03_neural_nets_pt1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/03_neural_nets_pt1/</guid><description>I plan to be teaming up with my new friend Douglas over at MMT Macro Trader.

I know it is not what leftie activists like to read straight up. Definitions about finance and economic systems are for nerds, right?
Wrong. We can point out several things both lefties and conservatives get horribly wrong for their own causes, even when their hearts are in the right place. Foremost among these is the tax payer funding myth. The trouble is, the requisite background to understanding why &amp;ldquo;tax payer funding&amp;rdquo; is a myth, involves an understanding of what money is, in essence, and in practice.</description></item><item><title>The Money Veils</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/04_money_veils/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/04_money_veils/</guid><description>There are several veils surrounding money, some theoretical and philosophical, some practical and real. I started writing this essay after a friend (Douglas the MMT Trader ) suggested I listen to Perry Mehrling&amp;rsquo;s lectures on money and banking, which cover as reading material the collected works of Allyn Young.
After only a short browse through Mehrling&amp;rsquo;s book on the collected works of Allyn Young I discovered a few interesting things related to MMT that I thought worth blogging about.</description></item><item><title>Macro Trading 1 - Intro</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_1_macro_trader/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_1_macro_trader/</guid><description>Macro trading is something I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently looked into, not as a trader, but as an academic seeking more real world experience. Macro trading models can benefit from MMT, but do not really use a bare Keen&amp;ndash;Minksy model because of the need to model markets, which are sub-macro. So I place macro trading models in a category of mesoscopic MMT analysis.
The MMT Macro Trader Paradigm Douglas over at Doug - MMT Macro Trader does a terrific job of using Bayesian models and MMT fiscal flow analysis to get very, very good 30 day predictions for the S&amp;amp;P forward market.</description></item><item><title>Tax Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/004_tax_myths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/004_tax_myths/</guid><description>Myths about Taxation and the Reality The reality:
Currency issuers do not, and cannot logically, use tax return for their spending. Currency users like you and I do not use tax return for our spending either, because we do not have legal authority to impose taxes in the first place. Special currency users like provincial or municipal governments) do not need tax receipts for their funding either, but local currency-using branches of governments that do not receive sufficient central government grant funds can be forced to impose taxes to get funds (numbers, scorepoints, in their bank accounts).</description></item><item><title>MT-2 - Flow of Funds</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_2_funds_flows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_2_funds_flows/</guid><description>The second in the planned series on Macro Trading MMT (MT for short.)
Sectoral Balances for Trading Alan Longbon wrote an interesting article on SeekingAlpha which outlined his investment strategy, which is pretty simple and highly MMT informed.

It is imprecisely measured by indicators like the CPI (consumer price index, a weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale in the state currency units).
Does Government Net Spending Cause Inflation? If you think &amp;ldquo;yes,&amp;rdquo; then you have succumbed to the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) myth.

(Myth 1.) Government deficits accumulate to government debt, which must be paid back in higher taxes. (Myth 2.) Government deficits are not stimulus, because increasing the money supply (which is what a net government deficit does) will just increase prices, if no taxes are raised, so the purchasing power of the extra dollars lowers to adjust to the status quo, and the net effect is just a temporary disruption in the market.</description></item><item><title>Interest Rate Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/007_interest_rate_myths/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/007_interest_rate_myths/</guid><description>This is one of the more contentious chapters. The MMT lens suggests the inflation rate is the interest rate, or at least a high enough interest rate will equal the inflation rate. But not all MMT informed economists would agree, and that is pretty much only because the econometric data analysis is inconclusive. However, we are working on analysis to show the MMT base case is correct under most &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; opening circumstances, which is that in normal times an upwards adjustment in the interest rate is inflationary, one-for-one.</description></item><item><title>Accelerators and Repellers -1</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/08_accelerators_repellers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/08_accelerators_repellers/</guid><description>This is one in possibly a series of posts for the general audience on some of the dynamical systems ideas underlying macroeconomics. Our focus is on macro and mesoeconomics. So we are not interested in particular stock prices, or even sectors, we are interested in the main aggregated market indices (in the USA the SPX, NASDAQ and whatever). This is partly pragmatic.

In the sciences, and let&amp;rsquo;s be generous and call macroeconomics a social science (there is theory and empirical data to test it, just not always conclusively), so we can formulate definitions, and theorems using the definitions, and then test them.</description></item><item><title>Pension Fund Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/012_pension_funds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/012_pension_funds/</guid><description>In this chapter we take a look at superannuation schemes, why they are useless today and maybe even harmful, and why they were at one time useful in the past.
Up-front, to avoid you going away immediately, I will say superannuation funds are not harmful if governments running the schemes do not use them to create mass unemployment. The trouble is they do!

Not because I disagree, but because I find Daniel&amp;rsquo;s blog informative, but lacking an MMT lens. But he gets a lot right, and is a student of Mehrling&amp;rsquo;s, so he understands balance sheets and whatnot. So with Daniel Nielson we are not dealing with some unhinged libertarian or Austrian School fantasist.</description></item><item><title>Problems with 'Sovereignty' in the Periphery Nations</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/020_peripherynations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/020_peripherynations/</guid><description>Some fresh MMT education material starts today.

New Zealand is an MMT Economy We already know, from the Banking Acts and Public Finance Acts that New Zealand is an MMT monetary economy.

To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are major disagreements in MMT analysis, but the emphasis on the politics varies form person to person.

Today the pain concerns the so-called money pyramid.
Money is Credit &amp;mdash; there is no pyramid&amp;hellip; Also all money is debt because credit is a promise to be redeemed, so is the debt of the issuer.
All money is an IOU of the issuer, the problem is getting others to accept it.

It is because he has a strong history buff spirit about him.

But it was a reminder that mainstream econ, even most Post-Keynesians, have the trade story partly backwards.
Ideally a nation does not want to trade, except for what they cannot domestically produce.
Practically all nations want to trade because they cannot source all their needs domestically.
The purpose of trade is not to generate peaceful relations, but peaceful relations is a happy consequence or side-effect.</description></item><item><title>Status is a Beyatch</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/15_status_bitches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/15_status_bitches/</guid><description>Interesting conversation Bill Mitchell had with a Japanese economics &amp;ldquo;professor&amp;rdquo; (professes to know some economics).

Japan Slips in GDP/Per Capita Ranking &amp;mdash; so what? The professor harped on a bit about how Japan had a &amp;ldquo;lost decade&amp;rdquo;. Bill explained well that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see in Japan any real loss of output.

But MMT has a very different perspective. We want a good government and we want full employment, and we can in fact have both. It is a political choice, not a whim of natural markets.
The (correct) MMT statement is,
With government there is unemployment by design, from inception, but also with government all the unemployment generated should (morally and optimally) be immediately eliminated.</description></item><item><title>Media Whores</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/16_media_whores/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/16_media_whores/</guid><description>I furore broke out in the right-wing media space recently, with some right-wing guy named &amp;ldquo;Crowder&amp;rdquo; attacking a &amp;ldquo;Jewish last name&amp;rdquo; right-wing media host &amp;mdash; probably by the name of Shapiro I am guessing.

The Article Came across this nice article on the problems with &amp;ldquo;Implicit Bias training&amp;rdquo;. Lesson and take-away: if you want a better workplace, do not do IBT, it is a waste of time. Instead try being actually empathetic yourself, it rubs off, and remove workplace barriers to minorities and people with disabilities or neurodivergences.
Sadly, I found particularly odious the Upwork example cited in the Aeon article.</description></item><item><title>Bond Econ Bro</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/47_bondeconbro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/47_bondeconbro/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Substack - Ohanga Pai and Post.news now for social media.

Over at Neutrality Studies, Pascal Lottaz replayed a commentary by a retired UK Ambassador, Craig Murray here .
