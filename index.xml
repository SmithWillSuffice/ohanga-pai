Main topics include macroeconomics, economic justice, the Job Guarantee policy and fiscal versus monetary policy. For public banking (really just banking in general) I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn heavily upon the prior work of Warren Mosler, Randall Wray, and Eric Tymoigne.
For employment issues I draw on Mosler again, and Bill Mitchell &amp;amp; Pavlina Tcherneva . For popular macroeconomics discourse I rely upon Money on the Left and Stephanie Kelton @Market Watch.</description></item><item><title>Dithering No More</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/01_first_content/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/01_first_content/</guid><description>After years of dithering and pussy footing around about where to publish my economic justice writing, I settled on this github repository&amp;hellip; because&amp;hellip; free-libre nerd.

They are agent-based models, and show the basic wealth distributions that occur generically given some rules for how entities (individuals or units like small firms) exchange assets.
These models are great for thinking about fair distribution policies, which at a government regulatory level means fiscal policy. The models show that highly unfair wealth distributions naturally occur even when asset exchanges are uniform and random.</description></item><item><title>Basic MMT and Economic Justice</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/001_basic_ohangapai/</guid><description>For most of this whole course on MMT I am going to use the example of New Zealand, since many people claim MMT only applies to a country like the USA which enjoys a global reserve currency status. This would be false on both counts. MMT applies perfectly well to a small open economy like New Zealand. The currency is the NZD. The US dollar is not a global reserve currency, since the Bretton-Woods system was abandoned over 50 years ago.</description></item><item><title>Neural Net Predictors</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/03_neural_nets_pt1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/03_neural_nets_pt1/</guid><description>I plan to be teaming up with my new friend Douglas over at MMT Macro Trader.

I know it is not what leftie activists like to read straight up. Definitions about finance and economic systems are for nerds, right?
Wrong. We can point out several things both lefties and conservatives get horribly wrong for their own causes, even when their hearts are in the right place. Foremost among these is the tax payer funding myth. The trouble is, the requisite background to understanding why &amp;ldquo;tax payer funding&amp;rdquo; is a myth, involves an understanding of what money is, in essence, and in practice.</description></item><item><title>Bond Myths</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/004_bond_myths/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/questions/004_bond_myths/</guid><description>This is a new chapter as at 2024, inserted in a rough pedagogical order. This chapter is no myth of course, we are myth-busting.
The myth is that: the government debt is a burden on our grandchildren. Complete nonsense. It is the exact opposite. It is ostensibly the net wealth of our grandkids in the form of NZD.

I started writing this essay after a friend (Douglas the MMT Trader ) suggested I listen to Perry Mehrling&amp;rsquo;s lectures on money and banking, which cover as reading material the collected works of Allyn Young.
After only a short browse through Mehrling&amp;rsquo;s book on the collected works of Allyn Young I discovered a few interesting things related to MMT that I thought worth blogging about.</description></item><item><title>Macro Trading 1 - Intro</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_1_macro_trader/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/099_1_macro_trader/</guid><description>Macro trading is something I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently looked into, not as a trader, but as an academic seeking more real world experience. Macro trading models can benefit from MMT, but do not really use a bare Keen&amp;ndash;Minksy model because of the need to model markets, which are sub-macro. So I place macro trading models in a category of mesoscopic MMT analysis.

Myths about Taxation and the Reality The reality:

Special currency users like provincial or municipal governments) do not need tax receipts for their funding either, but local currency-using branches of governments that do not receive sufficient central government grant funds can be forced to impose taxes to get funds (numbers, scorepoints, in their bank accounts).</description></item><item><title>NZ Macroconomics — I</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/100_00_nzecon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/100_00_nzecon/</guid><description>A new series on some aspects of NZ macroeconomics.

(Myth 1.) Government deficits accumulate to government debt, which must be paid back in higher taxes. (Myth 2.) Government deficits are not stimulus, because increasing the money supply (which is what a net government deficit does) will just increase prices, if no taxes are raised, so the purchasing power of the extra dollars lowers to adjust to the status quo, and the net effect is just a temporary disruption in the market.</description></item><item><title>MMT-ODES Working Models — II</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/200_01_mmtodes_working_models/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/200_01_mmtodes_working_models/</guid><description>Preparing for a mmm-0.3 model, with Godley Tables, I wanted to also take a breif excursion into fetching empirical data, specifically for New Zealand, since I do not see much point i =n making the effort to model the banking operations without some realistic empirical inputs.

The MMT lens suggests the inflation rate is the interest rate, or at least a high enough interest rate will equal the inflation rate.

ISLM Scenario Testing Basically we want to know for what the model can predict, how good is it? An AIC score might be nice too.

Today the pain concerns the so-called money pyramid.
Money is Credit &amp;mdash; there is no pyramid&amp;hellip; Also all money is debt because credit is a promise to be redeemed, so is the debt of the issuer.
All money is an IOU of the issuer, the problem is getting others to accept it. However, a &amp;ldquo;money thing&amp;rdquo; (an IOU) is as good as gold if the issuer always backs up their promise to redeem.</description></item><item><title>Macromodels X.0 — IS-MY</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/310_00_macromodels_ismy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/empirical/310_00_macromodels_ismy/</guid><description> Previous chapter Back to Next chapter MM—III, ISLM TOC MM—X.1, DSGE</description></item><item><title>Money and Banking Lec2-5</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/14_1_mab3_4_civilwar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/14_1_mab3_4_civilwar/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making the odd note about Mehrling&amp;#39;s course .

Detailed Chapter-by-Chapter Summary of Labor and Monopoly Capital by Harry Braverman (1974) Harry Braverman’s Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century is a foundational text in labor process theory, reviving Karl Marx’s analysis of work under capitalism for the 20th-century industrial and post-industrial world. It critiques how management appropriates workers’ knowledge, separates thought from execution, and progressively reduces work to routine tasks under monopoly capitalism.</description></item><item><title>Fear & Loathing in Los Vital</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/26_agi_fearandloathing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/26_agi_fearandloathing/</guid><description>Sometimes I criss-cross posts on philosophy of mind between the physics (over at T4GU ) and the Macroeconomics here at Ōhanga Pai.

But the university topic will go further, because we read in last weeks New Zealand capital city last surviving newspaper, The Dominion Post, that universities are being starved of funding, may need to fire thousands of staff, and cut back research.

I am so bitter about this I cannot name names, because that would imply friendly banter. I have to attack the ideas. There is nothing friendly about UBI, the UBI is a direct frontal attack on the working class. I have to fight back for workers.

Since the modern scam grift/ponzi of all time, cryptocurrency, is a loony-toons libertarian project, I have no good reason to read Dávila&amp;rsquo;s book. But it was recommended by MMT aware writer Brett Scott, so I figured I should give Dávila some slack.

Caveats In polite discourse I do not recommend using my language of &amp;ldquo;Welfare Dorks&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;UBI Dorks&amp;rdquo; so please substitute appropriate terminology.

My comments? I&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.
When &amp;ldquo;Politics&amp;rdquo; Sickens Us When the word &amp;ldquo;socialism&amp;rdquo; gets associated with so-called &amp;ldquo;Christian socialism&amp;rdquo; (disguising fascism, they&amp;rsquo;re neither Christian nor socialists) you get that sick feeling in your gut about &amp;ldquo;all politics&amp;rdquo;. it&amp;rsquo;s hard to avoid. But you have to avoid it.
Yes, by nature, economics and politics are sickening in both academic profession sphere and practical sphere.</description></item><item><title>Israel/Palestine</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/42_israel_palestine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 13:25:00 +1200</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/42_israel_palestine/</guid><description>Saturday fun &amp;hellip; for some &amp;mdash; listening to Jeffry Sachs go counter-paradigm on Israel/Palestine.

The Article Came across this nice article on the problems with &amp;ldquo;Implicit Bias training&amp;rdquo;.

Over at Neutrality Studies, Pascal Lottaz replayed a commentary by a retired UK Ambassador, Craig Murray here . The usual good stuff was said from a peace activist perspective, but tainted with all the usual pessimism and doom. I always find Pascal to be a good counterbalance to the nihilists, but he tends to say things straight-up, so is not wildly optimistic nor idealistic either.</description></item><item><title>Rain in Iran</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/59_rain_in_iran/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/59_rain_in_iran/</guid><description>Neocon Rain Kills When all the talk in Washington and the western establishment neoliberidiocracy is to reign in Iran, the mass of ordinary decent people should be getting public media stories about how the rain in Iran is the same as the rain in Africa or Nebraska.

What does this mean?
Full Spectral Dominance No, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a dumb physics pun humour. Although is is that too.
It means that if we disregard soft cultural values and religious preferences, so-called Identity politics, and the like, then the number of people who broadly support workers is massive, and spreads across the entire political spectrum.</description></item><item><title>Global Reserves of Stupidity</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/94_global_reserves_of_stupidity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/94_global_reserves_of_stupidity/</guid><description>We have enough reserves all right.${}^\ast$

Nothing more. Banks do not lend the reserves, they can&amp;rsquo;t, there is no software in place for that operation (because that software would then be illegal).

Scientists have to do an enormous amount of work to stabilize claims as accepted facts.
When one does not do the work then one is less a scientist, more a propagandist.
This speaks to climate change denialism, and all the rest: vaccine effectiveness deniers, but I would say:

We do live in an era of economic output abundance, with two massive problems:
We are producing too much crap no one needs to live a decent life, and this is exceeding planetary ecosystem boundaries. Some form of ecological collapse is bound to occur if we just blindly run ahead at the present rate of stupid crappy production of crappy things.</description></item><item><title>Red Budget Misdirection</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/98_red_budget_misdirection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/98_red_budget_misdirection/</guid><description>Anything that can be resourced in real terms the government can get done by funding in nominal terms, without question.
Question: Can we &amp;ldquo;afford&amp;rdquo; a green energy transition?
Answer: Yes, because we already have the real resources needed, maybe not the time to do so to avoid catastrophes, but all that means is the government investment is needed without further delay, and this can easily be done&amp;hellip; in monetary terms. The obstacle is pure political will and mal-education, nothing else.</description></item><item><title>Shmapitalism</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/99_shmapitalism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/99_shmapitalism/</guid><description>Steve Keen today back to good form debunking mainstream orthodox economics&amp;hellip; until&amp;hellip;

Nothing per se.
The problem is that governments are not seemingly capable of transcending the prevailing macroeconomics paradigms. Why is this important? Important to transcend, that is?
It is because regardless of the monetary system, there is no excuse for leaving people idle and unemployed when they might otherwise be contributing to building a more peaceful and harmonious society.
If you are beholden to some Ideology or another, however good you think it may be, you will be unable to transcend that paradigm, and thus might (innocently?</description></item><item><title>Murph Turf</title><link>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/113_murph_turf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/blog/113_murph_turf/</guid><description>There is a nice Spahghetti Leftist Trilogy from Richard Murphy.

i_t=\sigma \pi_t +\theta,
where \pi is inflation, i_t is the nominal interest rate, and \theta is a AR(1) error term with mean zero. \sigma is a parameter that governs how strongly the central bank responds to inflation.
The Euler equation gives us the following expression
Y_t=E(Y_t)-(i_t-E(\pi_{t+1})),
which gives us i_t=E(\pi_{t+1}) if Y_t is constant.
