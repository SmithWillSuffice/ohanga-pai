parameters, so one can simply curve fit and claim a DSGE model &ldquo;just works&rdquo;.
That is disingenuous of course, so we will want a long term forecast form
all the models, at least 6 months ahead. No one should expect a macroeconomic
model to forecast accurately that far ahead, just as no one should expect the
meteorological office to predict the weather six months ahead. But that is
not our purpose. We only desire a fair comparison for assessing parsimony of
the various models.</p><p>We <em>want</em> all the models to eventually fail. The idea is to see which
models are more robust.</p><p>If a macroeconomic model never failed than that&rsquo;d only be because it&rsquo;s buttons
were constantly being tweaked. Cheating! Like a CNN/LSTM. There is Zero
knowledge in such epicyclic type modelling.</p><h2 id=is-lm-history><a class=anchor href=#is-lm-history title='Anchor for: IS-LM History.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>IS-LM History</h2><p>This is the original bastardization of Keynes&rsquo; General Theory. It was
invented by John Hicks. It was always a stupid toy model. The fact
professional academic economists still teach this model is weird. It is not
like teaching Newtonian Gravity for physics classes, it is far worse. That is
because there is Zero Knowledge in the IS-LM model. IT does noty begin with
correct assumptions. Newtonian Gravity at least begins with a very good
approximation to GR.</p><p>However, unlike gravity, macroeconomics does not have a General Relativity
analogue. Perhaps the closest is the Keen&ndash;Minsky model, but we would
classify that MMT model as more like the analogue of Newtonian Gravity.
There really is no fundamental MMT macroeconomic model, because MMT
recognizes government policy (human brains) dictate a large amount of
structure in the real world dynamics of a macroeconomy.
It is like&mldr; good luck modelling <em>that!</em></p><p>In other words, if it is a pure mathematical model you desire, then the
state-of-the-art will probably always be a neural network model that
brute-forces the forecasting, subject to accurate policy input parameters.</p><p>Why being with a bastard model then? The answer is that MMT also
recognizes political and institutional inertia. Because government
economics advisors will tend to operate with a Loanable Funds or IS-LM model
in their head or in their spreadsheets, we want to at least understand why
they consistently get forecasts and policy backwards, promoting
unemployment to &ldquo;fight inflation&rdquo;, instead of promoting full employment
and not having to worry about inflation.</p><p>John Hicks later repudiated his IS-LM model entirely, he became embarrassed
by it, and overtly in his later publications admitted it left out the one
key ingredient of Keynes&rsquo; General Theory, which was that there is no tendency
to equilibrium, and that uncertainty plays a fundamental role in
macroeconomics. It is thus admittedly painful to bother taking the time to
explore IS-LM, but if we desire to be politically engaged and combat the
lunatics in professional economics, it is probably a good idea to
understand the source of their idiocy.</p><h3 id=relation-to-dsge><a class=anchor href=#relation-to-dsge title='Anchor for: Relation to DSGE.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Relation to DSGE</h3><p>Both IS-LM are equilibrium assumption models, IS-LM is the baby version,
so-to-speak. Fewer adjustable parameters, so perhaps more parsimonious,
but less useful in forecasting. Completely useless for informing
government policy.</p><h3 id=assumptions><a class=anchor href=#assumptions title='Anchor for: Assumptions.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Assumptions</h3><p>The IS-LM curves are hypothetical relations presumed to be an idealization
of some equilibrium between, (1) markets for goods &mdash; supply and demand
of real output, and (2) the money market (demand for currency, aka. liquidity).</p><p>The presumed equilibria are,</p><ol><li>(Real goods market) &mdash; investment = savings.</li><li>(Money market) demand for money = supply of money.</li></ol><p><strong>Assumption of interest rate effect:</strong> the model further assumes the interest
rate is endogenous (not determined by policy, but rather by markets forces
so that the money market equilibrium became a tautology:</p><blockquote><p>The interest rate is whatever rate it needs to be so that there is
equality of money demand and supply in the money market.</p></blockquote><p>It was further treated as a <em>given</em> (unquestioned assumption) that
goods market equilibrium could be established.</p><p>The IS-LM model then postulates an interdependence of the two markets.</p><p>Since real output is roughly proportional to employment, the IS-LM model
seeks to show how an equilibrium solution exists for some given level of
output (hence employment) and simultaneously an interest rate, where the
two markets are in equilibrium.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> we do not even need MMT understanding that the labour market is
controlled by a monopolist (government) so there is no natural interest
rate other than zero, to appreciate that the IS-LM model is already false,
because just from empirical data we can see there is no equilibrium
condition in real life markets. Thus from the outset we have to treat
the IS-LM model as nothing but a toy.</p><p><strong>Consequence:</strong> If the IS-LM model produces favourable forecasts then it
would be by accident.</p><p>However, let&rsquo;s persist.</p><h3 id=analytics><a class=anchor href=#analytics title='Anchor for: Analytics.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Analytics</h3><p>Stated more mathematically, unknowns are (i) real output,
(ii) the interest rate. IS-LM needs two equations so these can be
computed. Or minimally two <em>linear</em> equations. Non-linear models could be
admitted but then might not yield unique solutions.</p><h3 id=definitions><a class=anchor href=#definitions title='Anchor for: Definitions.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Definitions</h3><p>The Money Supply we will use is &ldquo;M1&rdquo; = notes, coins and bank deposits
(CD = &ldquo;current deposits&rdquo;).</p><h2 id=beyond-is-lm><a class=anchor href=#beyond-is-lm title='Anchor for: Beyond IS-LM.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Beyond IS-LM</h2><p>We already mentioned the DSGE model, which we will discuss in a later
chapter.</p><p>There is another more minimal extension of IS-LM, the AD-AS model
(Aggregate Demand&ndash;Aggregate Supply) but it does not significantly patch
any of the flaws in IS-LM, so is still a Zero Informative model.
We will instead, after briefly looking at DSGE, jump to a more MMT-like
model due to the economist Dirk Ehnts &mdash; the so-called ISMY model.
This model was developed for analyzing the EMU (European Monetary Union)
system of interlinked state economies, so is not a complete MMT model.
MMT models would apply to single currency regions where there is a
monopoly fiscal authority called &ldquo;the government&rdquo;. No such institution
exists for the EMU.</p><p>Collectively the EU governments plus the ECB act <em>as if</em> there were a
monopoly government, but the fiscal space is so constrained that using
such an &ldquo;effective government&rdquo; frame is probably unwise. It obscures the
full fiscal space that is available to a monopoly currency issuer with
full legislative power and control over the central bank and all
commercial banks. More importantly, for political purposes, it is just
a bad idea to say the EMU &ldquo;has a government,&rdquo; since that tends to insert
in the mind the notion of some kind of democracy, but this is entirely
lacking in the EU/EMU. Where there is no democracy is is a bad thing to
pretend there is one, since a democracy is probably not a bad system of
government to have in part. So if a corrupt elite-power driven government
is falsely though of as having democratic elements, and the result is
austerity and poverty, and evisceration of the working class, then it
is betetr to call that institution The Oligarchy, not &ldquo;the government&rdquo;.
