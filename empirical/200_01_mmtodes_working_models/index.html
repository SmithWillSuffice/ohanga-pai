breif excursion into fetching empirical data, specifically for New Zealand,
since I do not see much point i =n making the effort to model the banking
operations without some realistic empirical inputs.</p><p>This turns out to be painful, since NZ does not have a nice facility like
the St Louuis FED. In fact at presetn I get some betetr quality NZ data
from the FRED.</p><h3 id=refinement--03><a class=anchor href=#refinement--03 title='Anchor for: Refinement&ndash;0.3.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Refinement&ndash;0.3</h3><p><strong>Issue 1.</strong>
We&rsquo;d rather not write an arbitrary Investment function, right? The level
of investment should be determined by the interest rates. But in a
government centred economy &mdash; like every nation today &mdash; the interest
rate is a policy parameter. So we can just look-it-up from the RBNZ or
FRED or wherever. The banker only needs a credit-worthy customer. This is
good for us, it means we do not need to solve some awful market equilibrium
problem.</p><p><strong>Issue 2.</strong> While I think the Two-Sector model is worth refining, and is
a good one to use, it does not reveal much about the all important aspects
of a nominal &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, which is the Firm vs Worker conflict. It is a
vitally nasty bit of the present neoliberal capitalist system. Bosses do
not need to work to eat, Workers do. So,</p><blockquote><div style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;margin:10px 0">The labour market is an unfair game.</div></blockquote><p>One might even say grossly unfair, and it is not even a game, it is
life & death stuff. Hence important to model you might think?</p><p>I do so think.</p><p>Unfortunately, the painfulness of model complexity starts to rare its
ugly time-sucking head. I need Godley Tables at this stage if for no
other reason that to avoid $\pm$ sign mistakes. But also to ensure
stock-flow consistency.</p><p>Our Model is now <strong>(Three+1)</strong>-Sector Model (sounds a bit Minkowski! Have
we gone relativistic?),
but still closed, or if you prefer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Workers</strong> = All workers domestic and foreign, but wages in NZD.<br><strong>Firms</strong> = All firms domestic and foreign, dealing in NZD.<br><strong>Government</strong> = NZ Government.<br><strong>Banks</strong> = agents of the state, but still in the Godley Tables.</p></blockquote><p>So the Bank sector is the &ldquo;+1&rdquo;.</p><p>This way we do not need to worry about imports and exports, they are taken
into account.</p><p>Although our Government does not explicitly insure <em>all</em> bank deposits,
they have a track record in propping up commercial banks, so <em>for all
intents and purposes</em> the banks are in the Government Sector, which is why
I&rsquo;d call this a (3+1) model.</p><h3 id=investment-31-sectors><a class=anchor href=#investment-31-sectors title='Anchor for: Investment (3+1) Sectors.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Investment (3+1) Sectors</h3><p>The investment function can now be more complicated. We considered
split private debt + loans. If we had two sectors suffering different
interest rates they would just split the term into Loan and Debts,
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D) & = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_d D + i_g D_g\\
\text{into},\qquad \mathcal{I} &= \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D + i_g D_g \\
\end{align*}
$$
where $F_L$ are the Firm loans, and $F_D$ are the Firm debts. But this
would very soon almost necessitate introducing Godley Tables to keep the
loan and debt ledgers balanced, which means banking. I want to delay this
modelling for now, so we will bookmark it as something to do.</p><p>As before, $D_g$ is government debt, so is the interest-earning asset of
the Firms and Workers now. Though I was not sure if all of $D_g$ should go
to Investment. Probably we should split this using a savings propensity,
$s_g$. Then,
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta \mathcal{I} &\sim (1 -s_g) i_g D_g \\
\Delta S &\sim s_g i_G D_g
\end{align*}
$$
and so,
$$
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D_g) = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D +
(1-s_g) i_gD_g
$$</p><p>OK, but this means we have to put $s_gi_GD_g$ somewhere else. Obviously in
Firm and Worker deposits, $F_D$, $W_D$. But how much of the share? Should
we just use the monopoly parameter $\sigma$ from before? Or add another
knob to twiddle? Well, this depends on thee size of the firm I guess, so
it will require a new parameter. But is is something we should have
empirical data to guide us.</p><p>From the <a href=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/NZL target=_blank>IMF datamapper</a>
we can get $D_g$ and the interest paid on $D_g$.
But not the sector breakdown, for which we might need to dig into RBNZ data.
But in lieu of that, there is a split of all
&ldquo;private debt, loans and securities&rdquo;. That might include Tsy securities,
I am not sure, but the indicator or ratio aught to be a fair proxy for the
share of government interest-income.</p><div class=scroll tabindex=0><table><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Debt, loans, securities</th><th>% GDP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>Private</td><td>161.32</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Household</td><td>91.61</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Nonfinancial</td><td>60.71</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Let&rsquo;s conjure up a symbol for this ratio, say
$$
\sigma_G = 0.37
$$
for &ldquo;share of government interest-income (to firms)&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I will need to automate downloading these indicators. They are
our &ldquo;weather data&rdquo;. I have not fetched from the IMF before. But is seems a simple API, just a URL that gets a JSON file, <a href=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/help target=_blank>instructions here</a>
. For the indicator codes see: <a href=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1/indicators target=_blank>https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/api/v1/indicators</a></p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO:

I have another chapter on how to get
some NZ economic data. A few series we will like are bank deposits,
loans, and money aggregates. The RBNZ publishes these as xls
spreadsheets. I will write some python scripts for retrieving these, which
I will test over on the <a href=/ohanga-pai/empirical/100_00_nzecon/#bank-data-rbnz>data chapter</a>
.</p><p>There are lots of nice looking series there, like Consumption (<strong>M2</strong> table)
and Investment (<strong>M3</strong> table), and <strong>M9</strong>=labour market. <strong>M5</strong>=GDP. For
our Godley Tables: bank liabilities=<strong>S40</strong>, which used to be <strong>C17</strong>
before 2017 I think? and the bank assets=<strong>S34</strong> used to be <strong>S9</strong>.</p><h3 id=justifying-no-foreign-sector><a class=anchor href=#justifying-no-foreign-sector title='Anchor for: Justifying No Foreign Sector.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Justifying No Foreign Sector</h3><p>As regards impact on the NZ economy, we are only concerned with NZ$.
But all trade balances can be converted to NZD, and New Zealand operates
a floating exchange rate. So we care not about foreign flows of finance.
They are part of the NZ economy at large.</p><p><strong>What we Lose?</strong><br>With this <strong>Three+1</strong> model we cannot model the impact of foreign capital flows
on the government policy and price level. This is a major flaw in the event
of a foreign monopolist marking-up their price, especially today Crude Oil.</p><p>OK, but we&rsquo;d have to manually adjust the Foreign Import price variable
anyway, it&rsquo;s not a market reaction function easily modelled. Thus I&rsquo;m going
to put off modelling the Foreign Sector and the exchange rate
entirely until much later on.</p><p>Also, note we do not have a single exchange rate, the NZD floats with
respect to all currencies. So this external sector modelling truly is
a nightmare. It&rsquo;s just worth noting what analysis we lose as a result.</p><ul><li>No response to forex movements.</li><li>No response to import prices, especially crude oil.</li><li>No response to capital flows.
So we will have to try to capture such variables in some other fashion, by
using empirical data, just like the Meteorological Office uses weather
balloon and satellite data as inputs to revise weather forecasts.</li></ul><p>One way to kludge this is to have an arbitrary factor adjustment in the
price level that does an &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; adjustment to all three above
factors. Supposing we do this by just looking at the CPI, or PCE, then
our model would be empirical and would be only &ldquo;good&rdquo; to a few weeks out.</p><h3 id=government-debt><a class=anchor href=#government-debt title='Anchor for: Government Debt.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Government Debt</h3><p>To model government bonds, or $D_g$ we could simplify a bit, since
we really only need to increase the effects of $i_B$ and $i_g$ to an
equivalent effective $i^\ast_B$=interest
on bank deposits. What I mean is,</p><blockquote><p>$i_B^\ast\cdot (F_D + W_D)$ is functionally the same as $i_B\cdot(F_D+W_D) + i_g\cdot D_g$.</p></blockquote><p>This is an extreme form of what Mosler says: banks are agents of the State.</p><p>This is because it is functionally the same whenever the
government insures bank deposits, which maybe despite neoliberal threats, is
typically the case these days post-GFC. The government bond is only
different in that it gets booked as &ldquo;Government Debt&rdquo; rather than
Bank Liabilities. In a stable country like NZ there is a legal and
psychological difference, but no practical difference (except in behavioural
response functions, which of course do matter, but we will not worry since we have
no clue what the behaviours will be, yet).</p><p>The psychological difference is that government bonds are considered more
secure, less risky. All the risk is at the margins for traders, and who
cares for them? Not me. They&rsquo;re not the people feuling the real economy.
()Actually we might care, since they are the parasites. But I will care later.)</p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO

a need?</p><p>Hint: The MMT lens is perfectly good for &ldquo;highly macro&rdquo;, meaning we can
have Two Sector Balance, just Government and Non-Government. What is the
loss in using a Two Sector model?</p><p><strong>Reflections:</strong> In MMT unemployment is <em>defined</em> by:</p><blockquote><p><strong>(Unemployment)</strong> <em>People seeking to exchange their labour or goods
for tax credits.</em></p></blockquote><p>But wat&mldr; that means we do not need a Foreign Sector. Foreigners needing our government scorepoints are unemployed in our currency, which is a waste
of human lives (or at least some sort of dopiness needing elimination &mdash;
maybe the Aussies borrowed some NZD off us, for whatever silly reason).</p><p>Unemployment of NZ dollars is pointless, so we can really regard foreigners
as part of our economy, they are &ldquo;Kiwis who do not live in NZ and do
not own NZ things.&rdquo; You can add, &ldquo;&mldr; and who do not pay NZ taxes.&rdquo;
Big deal, whoop-dee-doo.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the downside then?</p><p>Obviously we will not have any iodea about international fincial flows,
and FOREX and sop forth can be a source of parasitic wasteful human
activity, so it might be nice to use a Three Sector model. But if we are
not too worried about those flows, then we should not care.</p><h4 id=running-the-simulation><a class=anchor href=#running-the-simulation title='Anchor for: Running the Simulation.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Running the Simulation</h4><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO

have no experience in building ODES models.</p><ol><li>Take the Toy model and add whatever features you think necessary for
more realism, which will not be computational no-gos; and remove bits of
the model you think are superfluous.</li><li>Fetch relevant real world data for the government of interest. My minimum
set currently is: (1) Unemployment (U6); (2) wage share; (3) output,
(4) price level (CPI is only a rough approximant). Then we need the policy
parameters: (5) interest rates (at least two); (6) tax rate (effective average).</li><li>Use parameter fitting tools, like Monte Carlo nonlinear regressions to
get fits to your other model parameters and structural constants.</li><li>Needless to say, if you fitting was for 2023-Q1 data, then your
testing needs to be for 2024-Q1, and then your forecasting can be made

more than a quarter of the next year. But the idea would be the model has all
four quarterly parameter adjustments. So we&rsquo;d be able to in a single

you would need to get a nice fit. Maybe also the EU as a whole? Maybe also
the UK? But I have not looked into other nations. Fetching time series
from the OECD and BIS portals can be automated, just not as smoothly as
with the FRED.</p><p>For NZ I could not find good Treasury Statements except form the NZ Treasury
XLS spreadsheets. StatsNZ is too cumbersome, and does not have the Treasury
data in any convenient form I can find.</p><p>If you want to develop some neural net predictors in parallel with ODES
models then banking sector data can be useful, but again our RBNZ does not
have a seamless portal for fetching this data from what I can tell.</p><p>Part of the problem here is that I am only doing this as an unpaid
volunteer, working &ldquo;for the community&rdquo; (I am my own boss, and I raise my
pay by 100% every year). If some pro time were devoted to the effort then
perhaps we could build a nice MMT data portal for NZ.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:20%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../200_00_mmtodes_working_models>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../200_00_mmtodes_working_models>MMT ODE Models — I</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../>(TBD)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#1585d5 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#1585d5><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
