literature research.</p><p>For our first Model we will start with a pretty crappy ODES, it is
nothing more than a crude attempt to put some words into the form of ODE&rsquo;s.
I literally did next to no thinking for this.</p><p><strong>MMM</strong> refers to Monetary Minsky Model. Although this one for starters
does not have much money, we have no Godley Tables.</p><p><strong>Exercise (a bad model):</strong> First have a look at
<a href=../../files/bad_mmm_0.toml download>this toml file here</a>,
and see if you can figure out why it is a bit dopey. Hint: the dynamical
variables should be independent.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Well, I did write that file, but I knew it was bad, because
I did not think about it, and there might even be some dimensional
inconsistencies. However, the thing which struck me next was that Price $P$
labour $\lambda$, and wages $u$, determine output $Y$. So we can turn that
ODES into a $(P, u, \lambda)$ model, I reckon. Just using a few definitions.</p><p><strong>Modifications:</strong> for pedagogical purposes I am going to display some
toml files I&rsquo;ve not generated code for, you can bother about code
generation, but I&rsquo;d counsel not to waste your time. This first chapter
is just theory. We will get to some models we trust in theory enough to
bother generating and running the code later on. &lsquo;and for this first fix
we need some definitions.</p><p>The new toml spec. is:</p><div class=highlight><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nx>TODO</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>The model is structurally similar to a simple Goodwin model. We have, $\dot{u}$ (which is <code>f_u</code> in the spec. file), and $\dot{\lambda}$ (which is <code>f_lambda</code>)
written in the Goodwin forms:
<span id=eq_GoodwinDesai_model>$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{u} & = -c u + u f(\lambda) \\
\dot{\lambda} & = a \lambda - \lambda g(u)
\end{align*}
$$</span></p><p><strong>Exercise: (Sanity Check)</strong> For a start, examine this model and check it
makes sense. I do not even recall if I had all $\pm$ signs correct, so you
can really treat this specification as total raw and ready for pounding.</p><p><strong>Exercise: (Asymptotics):</strong> Now check that appropriate asymptotic
dependence is being modelled. Nothing should be &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo;. Note: the
exponential grow for $A(t)$ is blowing up, but at a slow rate. You could
replace the exponential with a sigmoidal function. Try this and see if the
short run output significantly differs.</p><hr><p>In pedagogical spirit I thought we could proceed as follows:</p><ul><li>mmm-0.1 Add an investment function $\mathcal{I}(u)$, but using
&ldquo;primitive debt&rdquo; (no accounting variables) but with a price level.</li><li>mmm-0.2 Try to enforce sectoral balance some way.</li><li>mmm-0.3 Add the banking sector and accounts, so we can model
sectoral balances correctly, and debt &\ credit will be treated
monetarily, instead of primitively.</li></ul><p>What do I mean by &ldquo;primitive credit/debt&rdquo;? I do not really know, it
is just a model choice before we get the proper Godley tables. But I
guess you can think of it in monetary terms, just without accounting
records?</p><h3 id=refinement--01><a class=anchor href=#refinement--01 title='Anchor for: Refinement&ndash;0.1.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Refinement&ndash;0.1</h3><p>As an exercises, create your own model that adds an Investment
function $I(t)$. From this we can use the price model which gives $P$,
so derive Savings and Investment in nominal terms. With no Foreign Sector
yet (to come much later). Then in turn we will have a way to enforce
Sectoral Balance. But what is sectoral balance with just a closed economy?
What two sectors are there?</p><p>(Well, you can see where this must lead: in the later refinement we will
need to include government variables, $(G, T, \tau_r, i_G)$ &mdash; for
spending, tax return, tax rate, policy interest rate. Or some similar
minimum set.)</p><p>In the one I develop next I will us <em>primitive debt.</em> And the model
dynamic variables will be $(P, D, u, \lambda)$.</p><p>Or $(P, D, u, \lambda, A, N)$ for longer runs when productivity and
population, $A(t)$, $N(t)$, advance.</p><p>Crucially, &ldquo;debt&rdquo; will be private debt (we&rsquo;re ignoring government for
now, recall! &mldr; while we remove our toddlers wheels). This is bad of us.
We will not have <code>mmm-1.0</code> until we get a government.</p><p><em>Rate of change of Debt</em> (flow) is Investment
less Profits from sales,
$$
\frac{dD}{dt} = I - \Pi
$$</p><p><strong>Profit equation:</strong> What about this? It will depend on sales less
interest on debt and labour costs,
<span id=eq_profit_equation_single_sector>$$
\Pi = Y - w\cdot L - i_d\cdot D
$$</span>
To avoid the pedants piling upon us, at this stage &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; means
workers plus energy. But we&rsquo;re not going to worry for now about where
energy comes from! It&rsquo;s &ldquo;free&rdquo;, maybe from the Sun. This is of course
terrible modelling, since oil prices for starters are a huge source
of price instability (not so much production, since the lights will
still go on, you just increase the price, but maybe an add to
unemployment if import energy prices go up). We&rsquo;ll say domestic energy,
like food, is just part of output $Y$.</p><p>You can suppose there are primitive banks charging the interest
$i_d$ fee.</p><h4 id=investment-curve-mathcali><a class=anchor href=#investment-curve-mathcali title='Anchor for: Investment Curve ($\mathcal{I}$).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Investment Curve ($\mathcal{I}$)</h4><p>This is getting into some deep Keynes! But we can keep it simple.
To model an upwards (Minsky) instability we want Debt to grow with
investment if investment gets too wild, but we have that already. What
we need next is an investment response function that depends on profit
to the capitalist/investor class.</p><p><strong>Power Law Model:</strong><br>A prototype model is,
<span id=eq_investment_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}(\pi) = \frac{I}{Y} = \frac{a_i}{(b_i + c_i\cdot\pi)^{\gamma_i}} - d_i.
\end{equation}
$$</span>
This defines the <em>reduced investment function</em> $\mathcal{I}$. In our simple
model it is a function of a single variable, the <em>reduced profit rate</em>,
$\pi$, defined by,
<span id=eq_profit_reducedrate>$$
\begin{equation}
\pi = \frac{I}{Y} = \frac{\Pi}{\nu Y} = \frac{\Pi}{K}
\end{equation}
$$</p><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of new free parameters above in $\mathcal{I}$! But I have
not found ways to
derive investment&ndash;profit relations theoretically yet, so I will suck
this up.</p><p>We probably should not regard the exponent $\gamma_i$ as a parameter,
since the power law is a structural constant, which likely could be
theoretically fixed by macroeconomics theory, no modelling or data
fitting required, a lot like a critical exponent for phase transitions.
But to my knowledge no one has ever done this, and probably no one ever
needs to, since empirical uncertainty swamps most such nuances. We can
take the exponent to be $\gamma_i = 2$, without too much debate.</p><p>But if you have any objection do let me know.</p><p><strong>General Exponential Model:</strong><br>As an alternative to the power law, we can use tamer asymptotics
by using a General Exponential response function:
<span id=eq_investment_genexp_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\text{GenExp}(x) \quad =
(b - m) \exp\left[ \frac{s(x - a)}{b - m}\right] + m
\end{equation}
$$</span>
I sometimes write this $\text{GenExp}(x; a,b,s,m)$ to emphasize the
independent vaiable $x$ and the four parameters. The <em>function definition</em>
(not the function itself) is a function of the parameters and $x$.
What values of the constant four parameters you choose is a model decision.
Both can be fit to empirical data.</p><p>You select the constants $(a,b,s,m)$ then you have yourself a particular
function $\text{MyGenExp}(x)$.</p><p>We can use this general form for both Phillips curve and Investment
function responses, since both are upwards curving monotonic functions
of their single argument.</p><p>Even at this early stage you thus might wonder if we are not building
a Ptolemaic Epicycles ODE system?</p><p>My defences is that we are not, provided the relations we model are
based on real world institutional arrangements. It is not out fault in this
regard that we are unaware of all the structural constants. But think about
it! Political economy is not like the Weather or Celestial Mechanics, or even
the carbon atom. It is far more complex, and human beings have socially
constructed our economic systems with oodles of these parameters! All the
multitude of parameters are in fact real. You can see how many there are by
browsing the legal Statutes.</p><p>So we are in fact building a highly parsimonious model, becuas ee we
will use far fewer arbitrary constants than there are in the real world
macroeconomy. To a physicists, this is just one of the annoying things
about macroeconomics. It&rsquo;s a hot mess of Rube&ndash;Goldberg knobs and dials.</p><p><strong>Capital Growth Function ($\Gamma$):</strong><br>Sometimes it is nicer to think of investment in terms of capital growth,
$\Gamma$, which is <em>defined</em> as,
<span id=eq_capital_growth_rate>$$
\Gamma = \frac{\dot K}{K}
$$</span>
Introducing capital depreciation, $\delta$, a linear response function
for this is,
$$
\Gamma = \frac{1-u}{\nu} - \delta
$$
You can also try a different nonlinear parameterization using two
different constants, $\omega_K $ and $\bar{u}$, as follows
$$
\Gamma(u) = \omega_K \ln\left[ \frac{\bar{u} - u}{1 - u} \right] - \delta
$$

before we try to get government into the model we can begin with a
simpler mode of &ldquo;cost + markup&rdquo;. The markup uses a monopoly parameter,
but expressed instead as a <em>monopolists share</em> parameter $\sigma$.
The more the monopoly power, the more the markup, the less the wage
share, the worker share being $(1-\sigma)$. For the
rate of change we use a time constant, $\tau_P$.</p><p>How to use it? Well, wages $w$, and wage share is $u = w/A$. Equilibrium
is when worker share equals wage share,
$$
(1-\sigma) P - u = 0
$$
so that will be proportional to $(1-\sigma) \dot{P}$ for deviations away
from equilibrium. But what is the proportionality factor? Well, since $u$
and $P$ are currency units, or at least implied to be so, we need to divide
by a time period. This will be the out-of-equilibrium time constant, which
is typically a year to six months adjustment, though it can be empirically
fitted later if need be, so that&rsquo;s our parameter, $0.5 \le \tau_P \lt 1$.
Putting this together,
<span id=eq_price_markup_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{1}{\tau_P}\left(\frac{u}{ 1- \sigma } - P\right)
\end{equation}
$$</span>
Empirical studies might suggest $\sigma \approx 0.2$.</p><p><strong>Exercise ($\Delta P$ sign):</strong> You might wish to check the sign is
correct. What happens if the capitalist takes everything?</p><p><strong>Capitalist takes all:</strong> $\Rightarrow$ $\sigma = 1$, and $\dot P \to +\infty$.
Correct. That&rsquo;s easier to understand in reverse cause: if the price is
set to $\infty$ the workers gets zilch. Of course this never happens
because capitalists want to sell at least something.</p><p><strong>Worker takes all:</strong> $\Rightarrow$ $\sigma = 0$, implies the price was
so low the workers could afford it all (this is all &ldquo;in the macro&rdquo; you
appreciate, not a single firm or anything). Then what happens?<br><strong>When $u &lt; P$ :</strong> then there is downwards price pressure, due to workers
unable to buy all the goods. Correct.<br><strong>When $u > P$ :</strong> the sales $P$ is a upwards price pressure, $\dot P > 0$,
due to high effective demand from $u$. Correct again.</p><p>In a market economy with government the currency monopoly, the
sectoral balance will be needed to get a proper price function. That&rsquo;s
because it is government spending $G$ which sets the price level.
We will leave this as a TODO later. (Especially because I&rsquo;ve never come
across dynamical models where this has been taken into considerations, and
I&rsquo;m still thinking about how best to model this.)</p><h4 id=phillips-curve-phi><a class=anchor href=#phillips-curve-phi title='Anchor for: Phillips Curve ($\Phi$).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Phillips Curve ($\Phi$)</h4><p>Without explicit accounting systems, a Phillips Curve
is practically necessary in the model because we need some way to enforce
the constraint $0 \gt \lambda &lt; 1$. One way is to have a Phillips Curve
$\Phi(u)$ which diverges at $\lambda = 1$. The conventional form is,</p><span id=eq_phillips_curve>$$
\Phi(\lambda) = \frac{d}{(1 - \lambda)^\gamma} - c
$$</span>
A numerical problem with this form is that unlike an exponential, it
requires careful tuning of the constants, since they have dimensions, so
if you use arbitrary constants you risk ODE instability. That just means it
can be a little painful trial and error to get good constants.<p>How does this asymptotics work? Well, we need one of the derivatives to
also diverge at $\lambda = 1$. Which one? It is not going to be Debt or
Output ($Y$) right? A finite $L=N$ number of workers cannot generate
diverging output or debt for investors. Thus (in the present modelling) it
has to be in $\dot u$, in the wage share.</p><p><strong>Warning!</strong> One thing computationally you need to worry about is if you choose
a fractional $\gamma_p$, say $\gamam_p = 1.3$ and you do not have good
asymptotics for $\lambda$, since of $\lambda > 1$ you will get a root of
a negative number for the power law Phillips curve. While python can
handle that, the usual solvers from numpy, scipy or gnuScienceLib probably
do not work with complex functions, Julia would need a complex package,
but in both languages this is unlikely to play well with your ODE solver.
This is why $]\gamma_p = 2.0$ is &ldquo;numerically safe&rdquo; even if not perfectly
empirically accurate.</p><p>If you scroll back, you see we already had this correct
functional response in the wage share ODE $\dot u$,
(<a href=#eq_GoodwinDesai_model>see above</a>
) we just re-write it now using the
more suggestive symbol $\Phi$ for $f$ (they&rsquo;re the same thing):
$$
\dot{u} = u \cdot\bigl( c - \Phi(\lambda) \bigr)
$$</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> No need to write toml for this just yet, but have a think
about what you need to change to introduce a Job Guarantee labour
buffer?, hence full employment $\lambda = 1$ permanently. Hint: we still
need to use the Phillips curve with that divergence, otherwise we have
no buffer mechanics.</p><h4 id=employment-and-output><a class=anchor href=#employment-and-output title='Anchor for: Employment and Output.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Employment and Output</h4><p>Recall(?) these are not independent, so our model dynamical variables are
either $(\lambda, u, P, D)$ or $(Y, u, P, D)$. I usually go for $\lambda$
and think of output $Y$ as dependent on labour. But what is the substitution?</p><p>It is easiest for me to begin with a reasonable definition of output:
$$
Y = \lambda A N
$$
For <em>macroeconomics</em> that is a pretty hard & fast definition. Differentiating
using the product and quotient rules, we see,
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\dot Y}{Y} & = \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda} + \frac{\dot A}{A} + \frac{\dot N}{N} \\
& = \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda} + \alpha + \beta\\
\therefore\qquad \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda}& =
\frac{\dot Y}{Y} - \alpha - \beta
\end{align*}
$$
The second line there is a short run model $A(t)$and $N(t)$ where can be
regarded as slow exponentials,
so basically linear. We really want them sigmoidal, but in all honesty who
knows where the inflexion point is? Even a linear function will suffice
from an empirical fit 0&mdash; which is because we never inted to run our MMT
models for more than a year or two. Why? I told you earlier: because it
would be silly to do so, every bit as silly as using a two week weather
forecast to extrapolate out to a year.</p><p>Anyhow, exponentials make it easier in this case since then
$\dot{A}/A = \alpha$, the productivity growth rate. Same for
$\dot N/N = \beta$, the population growth rate. Heck dude! You just manually
tweak these year-to-year as census data comes in. What else are you going
to do? Predict female birth propensity? Predict scientific innovation?
(No, and No.)</p><p>Now looking back at the

well-justified models, assuming $L$ is labour + energy. This beggars
belief a bit, since energy adds to costs, hence price, but we&rsquo;re going to
ignore that for now. Note that presently our ODES does not incorporate
the Price ODE, even though we have one. It is autonomous, purely dependent
on the mechanics of the Cycle. This is because we have not incorporate
Government into the model yet, despite this being our grand ultimate
objective!</p><p>Anyhow,
$$
\text{Leontief:}\quad Y = \text{min} \left\{\frac{K(t)}{\nu}, A(t)L(t)\right\}
$$
but we&rsquo;ve been assuming $Y = K\nu$. This is justified as the
assumption of full utilization of capital: $K/\nu \approx L N$.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> What can you do if empirically you know this is not the case?
Say $K/\nu &lt; L N$? Doesn&rsquo;t that just mean you can redefine $\nu$?</p><p>In which case, you aught not lie about it, and you say we have a <em>structurally
effective</em> $\nu_\text{eff} &lt; \nu$, such that $LN=K/\nu_\text{eff}$. If you
are a policy person you might then
wish to research into why this is so, if you think the Leonteif model is ok.
But seriously, are you going to put research resources into this? The
macroeconomy is far too messy and gnarly to worry with this, I would say.</p><blockquote><p>What matters is full employment and decent livelihoods for all people.</p></blockquote><p>The MMT dynamics, and especially what the Price level is doing, are nothing
compared to this objective. And no ODE solver analysis is going to help you
achieve this objective. Hence, no, I don&rsquo;t care if the Leontief model is a
bit unrealistic.</p><p>That all said, I am going to save this Goodwin Model and run it to check
the software system is working.</p><h3 id=a-puzzle-----closing-the-ode><a class=anchor href=#a-puzzle-----closing-the-ode title='Anchor for: A Puzzle &mdash; Closing the ODE.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Puzzle &mdash; Closing the ODE</h3><p>While writing the first draft I had got to this point:
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot u &= u \cdot\bigl(c - \Phi(\lambda)\bigr) \\
\dot \lambda & = \lambda \cdot \bigl( \Gamma(u) - \alpha - \beta \bigr) \\
\dot D &= I - \Pi \\
\dot P &= \frac{1}{\tau_P} \cdot \left(\frac{u}{1 - \sigma} - P\right).
\end{align*}
$$
The price equation is nicely <em>in your face</em> there in large fractions! Sort
of perversely fitting, since it seems the odd one out, it looks like it
can be dropped and we&rsquo;d still have a valid ODES. But you might in cany case
leave it alone since maybe it is nice to track &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; in simulation
real-time.</p><p>Is this a well-defined ODES?
This is a nice student exercise.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that the price level $P$ is actually fed-back into the
other ODE&rsquo;s. Hint: Is output $Y$ nominal or real?</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Close the ODE system, that is, find the substitutions needed
to get all dynamical variables on the left in terms of known functions
of time $t$ or the current variables at time $t$, $\lambda(t), u(t)$ etc.
Hint: $\Gamma(u)$ is fine, that&rsquo;s a response function we have defined.</p><p><strong>Solution?:</strong> The difficulty I had was an apparent inconsistency on my
scrap paper workings, since in back-tracking to compute investment $I$ and
profit $\Pi$ for the $\dot D$ response, I had two different solutions. So I
had to do some algebra detective work to avoid a circularity or
over-determination. Unfortunately I trashed the scrap paper so cannot
reproduce my error.</p><p>We had, which is I believe a mere <em>definition</em> of $\mathcal{I}$,
$$
I(\pi) = Y \cdot \mathcal{I}(\pi)
$$
which seems ok, and $\mathcal{I}(\pi)$ was that power law, or the GenExp
response function, it just depends on $\pi$. OK, but what is $\pi$?
We had,
$$
\pi = \frac{\Pi}{Y} = \frac{\Pi}{\lambda A N}
$$
that&rsquo;s ok. But I&rsquo;ve dropped the independent variables, since I forgot what
$\Pi$ depends upon. All we see there is $\pi = \pi(\lambda)$ which would be ok.
So what is $\Pi$? We had a practical definition,
$$
\begin{align*}
\Pi &= Y - uAL - i_d D \\
&= Y - uA^2 \lambda - i_d D
\end{align*}
$$
I think that&rsquo;s all, the end of the line. All three terms are now
consistently determined by $(u, \lambda, P, D)$, or really in this
simple model by $(u, \lambda, D)$.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Check this is so. If it is not then fix it!</p><p>I myself will quit at this point and declare victory since life is too short.
Plus, my feelings for full employment do not care about my mathematics. Plus
I don&rsquo;t like this model, since the price level $P$, is not fed-back into
employment $\dot \lambda$ directly, but I think it should be.</p><h4 id=productivity-squared><a class=anchor href=#productivity-squared title='Anchor for: Productivity Squared.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Productivity Squared</h4><p>This was the first time I noticed this modified Goodwin system depends
on $A^2$. A little nonlinearity. Where&rsquo;&rsquo;s the turning point I wondered?
Since $A(t)$ is growing slowly it is not too important, but I did wonder
if I&rsquo;d got the dimensions correct? That&rsquo;s hard to check without some Typing
(<em>data types</em>, not keyboard bashing).</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Is the $A^2$ dependence correct there?</p><p>Should we spell out the $\dot D$ equation? Well, we now understand,
$$
\pi = \pi (\lambda, D)
$$
so we have got,
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dD}{dt} & = \lambda A N \mathcal{I}(\lambda, D) -\Bigl( \lambda A N - u A^2 \lambda - i_d D \Bigr)\\
& = \lambda A N \cdot\bigl( \mathcal{I}(\lambda, D) - 1\bigr) + u A^2 \lambda + i_d D
\end{align*}
$$
where,
$$
\mathcal{I}(\pi) = \frac{a_i}{(b_i + c_i \pi(\lambda, D))} - d_i.
$$
Is the full stop for real now?</p><p>Well, I doubt there are any cancellations to be made or anything, so yeah, I

this <em>inflation neutral policy setting.</em> Which in my mind is a good policy
regime. No one should ever care about the price level, it&rsquo;s just the

The clear issue I have with the above model is no clear sectoral balance,
since it is a One Sector model (a closed PK circuit).</p><p><strong>Issue 2.</strong> I want the government as currency monopolist to get a proper
MMT system. So we need to change the Price equation, and put the price level
into the wage dynamics <em>directly</em> somehow, to provide stronger policy response
pressure, not just passively via nominal output $Y = Y_r P$.</p><p><strong>Issue 3.</strong> In my Goodwin model from about a decade ago, I saw that I wrote an
investment function. It used a depreciation parameter $\delta$, but this was
not automatically guaranteeing sectoral balance consistent. So today I am
trying a different way to get an investment function. Since $I$ is in the
Sectoral Balance, we can simply make it a dependent variable. Drop the
depreciation parameters $\delta$, and instead us a savings desires
parameter $s$ (same thing, from a different point of view&mldr; well, roughly).
I think this is advantageous, since savings desires are measurable, while
depreciation is a dodgy parameter (possibly reasonably constant, but hard
to quantify).</p><h3 id=sectoral-balance><a class=anchor href=#sectoral-balance title='Anchor for: Sectoral Balance.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Sectoral Balance</h3><p>We now want to think about at just Two Sectors: Government and
Non-Government.</p><p>There is an option from here to go to a closed economy but with a
banking sector and two other sectors, Firms and Workers. But I consider
this to be too &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; (zero government) and completely unrealistic,
so no better than the previous Goodwin model. So instead in my development
I wanted to at least try to have a go at getting a simplified
Two Sector model.</p><p>You recall what this is? <em>Sectoral balances always sum to zero.</em></p><span id=two_sector_balance>$$

through my reasoning, so you should try it on your own first to compare.<p>We had <em>rate of change</em> of private debt already $\dot D$, where $D$ is the

It is really not too hard
to incorporate the price level more explicitly into the previous
Goodwin+Debt model. We just need to think about the effect of changes in
the price level on wages share $u$ and employment rate $\lambda$.</p><p>Lets tackle raw wages first, $w = uA$.</p><ul><li>Employment effect: same as before, the Phillips curve, $\dot w \sim w \Phi$.</li><li>Rate of change of employment pressure: we can use,
$$
\dot w \sim \varpi w \frac{d\lambda}{dt}
$$
which introduces a new parameter $\varpi \approx 0.1$ (empirically).</li><li>Price pressure: direct proportionality is reasonable here, but with a
logarithmic dependence:
$$
\dot w \sim w \frac{d}{dt} \log (P(t)) = w \frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt}
$$</li></ul><p>These are the only three sensitivities I think we need worry about.
(Unless you have others in mind?)</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Convert the above into a new DE for $\dot u$.</p><p>Hint: use the identity:
$$
\frac{\dot u}{u} = \frac{\dot w}{w} - \frac{\dot A}{A} = \frac{\dot w}{w} - \alpha
$$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Beginning with a DE for wages, $w$, as in the Goodwin model, but with the
price pressure, and employment pressure:
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot w & = w\cdot \left[ \Phi(\lambda)+ \varpi \frac{\dot\lambda}{\lambda} + \frac{\dot P}{P}\right] \\
\therefore\quad \dot u = \frac{d (w/A)}{dt} &= u\cdot \left[ \Phi(\lambda)+ \varpi \frac{\dot\lambda}{\lambda} + \frac{\dot P}{P} - \alpha\right]

we do not need to write that out explicitly, so we still have:

but that is for zero government, Two-Sector Firm + Workers. For our more
MMT model we want a consolidated non-government sector, so want to net
private sector credit and debt.
$$

$$</p><p><strong>An Interesting Model:</strong>
Why? Because in this model you should note $i_g D_g$ adds to NG sector
profit. How? It is because with only two sides to the ledger we are
saying this &ldquo;debt&rdquo; is the government debt, or the accumulated $(G - T)$.
That is by accounting identity NG sector savings.</p><p>This is so important I think I will come back to it in the next section.</p><p>I suspect this is the opposite to how mainstream economists might think,

in so many horrific ways.</p><p><strong>The Question:</strong>
Can we write a simple Two-Sector (G&ndash;NG) model that is stock-flow
consistent, without using Godley Tables?</p><p>Surely we can.

savings-flow $S$, which is the rate of change of savings per anum. (It
should really be called &lsquo;Surplus&rsquo; and $\dot S$, but I will stick with
standard usage).</li><li>Use an effective tax rate on consumption, or on output: that&rsquo;s a model
choice, perhaps consumption $C$ is roughly proportional to output $Y$ (a
discount/ for inventory growth/decline), so we can just note that we&rsquo;re
absorbed that into the constant $r_T$,
which is a policy parameter, if you want, call it &ldquo;effective&rdquo; and use the
symbol $r^\ast_T$,
$$
T = r^\ast_Y \cdot Y
$$</li></ul><p>New Zealand has an equivalent effective flat tax rate of about
$r_T \approx 0.34$. I&rsquo;ll check this in real time using data
pulls later, using GDP$\approx Y$, and the published tax returns, or if
it is available use the OCED time series.</p><p>(There is
<a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-sub-issues/global-tax-revenues/revenue-statistics-new-zealand.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target=_blank>quite a range in the OECD</a>
,
from $0.17$ to $0.44$.)</p><p>What else?</p><p>Well, is there not a potential inconsistency to resolve? We cannot have
$(G-T) + (I-S) = 0$ or
$\dot D = (S - I)$, together with an independent equation
$\dot D = I - \Pi$. How can these possibly be the same?
The thing is, here we&rsquo;ve changed the meaning of the Debt. It is now the
consolidated debt <em>of the government</em>, so it is interest-income for
the NG sector, i.e. Credit of the NG sector.</p><p>Can we just then drop the old equation for $\dot D$? Since that previous
model is no longer applicable?</p><p>I think I convinced myself, but here is some further reasoning in case
you need convincing &mdash; but do write to me if you disagree.</p><blockquote><p>The meaning of “debt” has changed in our new model, and so
the dynamics that determine it must change accordingly.<br><strong>Old Model: Private Debt</strong><br>In many Keen-style models (e.g. Minskyan/Post-Keynesian ones), you&rsquo;d&rsquo; have:
$$
\dot{D} = I - \Pi
$$
where $D$=private debt (owed by firms to banks); $I$: investment spending
(funded via borrowing); $\Pi$: profits (used to repay debt). This equation
represents net new borrowing by firms &mdash; they borrow when $I > \Pi$, and
repay when $\Pi > I$. It reflects firm-level internal finance versus
reliance on credit.<br>      This makes sense in
<strong>private credit models</strong>, where the banking sector expands money and credit.<br>      <strong>Our New Model:</strong> Government Debt. We now
define: $D$=<strong>public debt</strong> (government liabilities), so $D$ is now the
asset of the non-government sector, i.e., their <strong>net financial wealth</strong>.
And we assume:
$$
\dot{D}_g = G - T.
$$
This is the fiscal budget identity: the government increases its debt
when it runs a deficit. So now $D$ is <strong>not</strong> private borrowing for
investment. It&rsquo;s public injection (or net spending les tax return), and
plays an entirely different accounting role.</p></blockquote><p>The conclusion I reach is that the previous $\dot D$ equation is
incompatible with our revised model. The old equation $\dot{D} = I - \Pi$
assumed <strong>D is firm debt</strong>, a <strong>liability</strong> of the non-government sector.
Our new meaning of $D_g$ is <strong>government debt</strong>, an <strong>asset</strong> of the
non-government sector.</p><p>Hence, using both equations simultaneously would create a <strong>logical inconsistency</strong>. So we will drop the old equation $\dot{D} = I - \Pi$, and
Instead, now use:
$$
\dot{D}_g = G - T
$$
and re-interpret $-D\to +D_g$ as consolidated public debt, and therefore
the <em>accumulated net financial wealth</em> of the non-government sector.</p><p><strong>What happens to investment now?</strong><br>If we&rsquo;re not modelling private credit, and if firms invest from
<em>retained earnings</em> and/or government demand, then can investment $I$
still be made a function of the profit rate $\pi$?</p><p>I think yes, since we have one degree of freedom, since we have no equation
for Savings (or Surplus) $S$.</p><p><strong>It is a modelling Choice:</strong> do you want to model an Investment function,
or a Savings functions?</p><p>Since in the MMT/PK analysis <em>savings are the accounting records of past
investment</em> &mdash; one person&rsquo;s spending is another&rsquo;s income, therefore I think
it is fine to go with the choice of modelling $I$ or $\mathcal{I}$ roughly as
before. Then Savings $S$ will be computed <em>ex poste</em> from the sectoral balance.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> You want to check the previous Investment function is still consistent.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> It is not, we need at least one change, $D \to -D_g$. Let&rsquo;s
trace back:
$$
\text{Investment function:}\quad \mathcal{I} = \frac{I}{Y} = \frac{a_i}{b_i + c_i\pi} - d_i
$$
then trace back again:
<span id=eq_profit_equation_twosector>$$
\Pi = Y - w\cdot L + i_g\cdot D_g
$$</span>
where as noted above we&rsquo;ve flipped the sign on $i_g D_g$ compared to the
<a href=#eq_profit_equation_single_sector>previous function</a>
,
to reflect our inversion of the ledger side on which we score $D$. It is
now interest-income, asset of thee NG sector, not a liability as we had
before.</p><p>This should be good, since when public expenditure expands we certainly
should see investment expand. This is the MMT Lens, not the neoclassical
backwards lens. <em>Government net spending crowds-in investment, not out.</em></p><p><strong>Lesson Point:</strong><br>This is worth pausing upon. Mainstream macro models
might go wrong at precisely these $\pm$ choice junctures. They might
otherwise agree with MMT diagnostics, which might lead to completely
opposite government policy responses. Remarkable things may happen when
policy makers realize the tax return is not funding the government.</p><p><strong>Have we Closed the Revised ODES?</strong><br>What about the function for $G$?</p><p>This is a hard one for me, there are many choices. Let&rsquo;s try to figure out
present NZ Government policy? Maybe with a more progressive government too.</p><ol><li>One option is a fixed public sector desire &mdash; for schools, healthcare,
social services: hence maybe the Government is basically choosing to &ldquo;take&rdquo;
a fixed chunk of <strong>real</strong> output:
$$
G = c_G Y_r \cdot P = c_G Y.
$$</li><li>Constant spending (fiscal rules approach):
$$
G = G_0
$$</li><li>Inflation adjusted spending, fixed public sector but in <strong>nominal terms</strong>:
$$
G = P\cdot G_r
$$
with $G_r$ the spending constant.</li></ol><p>So I guess you should try all three, and see which better fits
empirical data. It is hard to read government policy and Statutes to
clearly make either call. Though on the Treasury statements we certainly
never see option 2, not in New Zealand anyway. We are a growing economy
(even if possibly on an unsustainable path).</p><p>I might go with Option <strong>1</strong>, government takes a fixed chunk of the
real Pie.
To answer the question, yes, I think we have a well-defined model now.
Investment is still a function we can compute,
same as before, except with the different sign on the &ldquo;debt&rdquo; term.
We would compute savings as before, but now having a sectoral meaning, it
is the NG sector savings rate,
$$
S = (G-T) + I.
$$</p><p>Before Savings rate and Debt were endogenous, just a shuffling of currency
within the single sector system. Now we have proper savings in the NG sector,
since the Government is exogenous to the <em>post-Keynesians circuit.</em>
Basically, we&rsquo;ve now got the first and most rudimentary MMT system.
Achieved without Godley Tables by consolidating the NG sector.</p><h4 id=model-mmm-02-toml><a class=anchor href=#model-mmm-02-toml title='Anchor for: Model mmm-0.2 toml.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Model mmm-0.2 toml</h4><p>Here was an early version, not bug-free, so students should not expect

primitive Julia ODE solver, I think it was because we now have the derivatives
interdependent, but I was using the previous time step derivative in the
current time step. I was producing an instability at about $t=45$, where wage
share $u$ suddenly dropped to beyond 100, and employment went super
negative (so unphysical).</p><p>I fixed this by changing the software entirely to a new type of algebraic
ODE solver, the <code>DifferentialEquation</code> Julia package.</p><p>Along the way, I found I cannot use a variable <code>u</code>, so changed my toml wage

around $t=45$, and I have not got to the bottom of this. The wage
share $u_s$ starts to get very step-like in response. Unsurprising while
the price function gets the sharp kink, and $d\ln P/dt$ is a term in $du_s/dt$.
It suggests our crude post-Keynesian price model is a bit unrealistic.</p><p>One thing is the Debt which is now $(G-T)$ feeds into $P$ linearly, but

more variation. But also, not so surprised it flatlines. Can you see

about our model for debt $D_g$ is a bit weird somewhere else. After head
scratching a bit I looked at the parameters, and like an idiot I&rsquo;d set the
two rates equal! $i_G = r_T$. But that was an interesting lesson nonetheless,
since you might want to think about how a government would choose the
policy rates.</p><h4 id=the-challenge><a class=anchor href=#the-challenge title='Anchor for: The Challenge.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Challenge</h4><p><strong>?</strong> Maybe you could try writing a response function for the rates
that prevents the increasing oscillation amplitude in the price level?
(But also, why bother? If in our model a time unit is one year, then 45
years out seems a bit too far to give a damn?) Hence, the key thing we&rsquo;d
want to suppress is the cycle in the first place.</p><p>Well, you should bother since it&rsquo;s a good learning opportunity. We at
least know damn well we have not used a significant degree of freedom,
the government debt $D_g$. Why not use it to counter the cycle?</p><p>This makes it at least a mildly interesting observation that having
$\dot D =0$ by policy design is not too destabilizing, but not terrific
either. The cycle period lengthens, but the price level swings are
intolerable, one must say. The price level never goes down so badly
in he real world, and deflation is a real killer &mdash; exacerbates
inequality badly (our model cannot see this yet, since we are not
tracking sectoral savings).</p><p>A sure sign of a wrecking economy is <strong>Deflation</strong>. You want the
price level always going mildly upwards, forever.</p><p>For more serious usage I&rsquo;d just fit the rates to empirical data, in lieu of
knowing what goes on in government official head spaces. This is modelling
on Keynes&rsquo; dictum: the best guide to the future is the near past.</p><p>OK, but how would you write some sort of stone cold mathematical ersatz
for the approximation to policy psychology rate setting by government?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not up for tweaking the modelling at this stage, I&rsquo;m just getting
software development done, so I&rsquo;ll leave this issue alone for now.
This brings up the issue of the whole point of the exercise.</p><p><strong>Overall Nastiness:</strong> This toy economy has some bad positive eigenvalues,
this is what makes the cycle amplitude grow, and at late times
horrific unemployment. As a policy wonk seeing anything similar you&rsquo;d
be thinking I need some negative eigenvalues to tame the cycles.</p><p>If I had the time, I&rsquo;d numerically compute the Jacobian matrix every
few time steps, and compute the eigenvalues and plot them (add to the CSV).
(Not every time step, since it&rsquo;s compute intensive.)</p><h3 id=point-of-the-modelling><a class=anchor href=#point-of-the-modelling title='Anchor for: Point of the Modelling?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Point of the Modelling?</h3><p>Even this simple model could be useful. The art of it would be to find
tweaks to the model that make just the government policy variables the
only things that generate movements in prices. a bit of a hard task,
for sure, but it&rsquo;s the Holy Grail of macroeconomics. Price stability
with Full employment, and decent output per capita.</p><p>You might stand a better chance of doing this with a simpler model?
It would then by policy wonk instructive, I&rsquo;d imagine.</p><p><strong>For Policy:</strong> well, we know the model is too primitive, but at least it
shows why a monetary economy can be cyclical even with mild government
support. What this implies is that government support needs to be
stronger, not so mild.</p><p>Why? Well, I have not bothered reproducing the PK closed circuit model,
but ProfKeen did that decades ago, and we know it is severely unstable,
and has a clear Minksy Moment, that is unrecoverable. It is essentially
a money hoarders model, and ends in total greed and disaster for workers,
hence ultimately disaster for everyone, even the hoarders (a zillion
dollars buys zero if output is zero).</p><p>This is because the model has no government sector at all. It&rsquo;s pure
libertarian. It ends in dystopia, and you&rsquo;d have to imagine people
somehow pick themselves up from the ashes of severe unemployment &mdash; by
forming a government!</p><h3 id=refinement--03><a class=anchor href=#refinement--03 title='Anchor for: Refinement&ndash;0.3.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Refinement&ndash;0.3</h3><p><strong>Issue 1.</strong>
We&rsquo;d rather not write an arbitrary Investment function, right? The level
of investment should be determined by the interest rates. But in a
government centred economy &mdash; like every nation today &mdash; the interest
rate is a policy parameter. So we can just look-it-up from the RBNZ or
FRED or wherever. The banker only needs a credit-worthy customer. This is
good for us, it means we do not need to solve some awful market equilibrium
problem.</p><p><strong>Issue 2.</strong> While I think the Two-Sector model is worth refining, and is
a good one to use, it does not reveal much about the all important aspects
of a nominal &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, which is the Firm vs Worker conflict. It is a
vitally nasty bit of the present neoliberal capitalist system. Bosses do
not need to work to eat, Workers do. So,</p><blockquote><div style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;margin:10px 0">The labour market is an unfair game.</div></blockquote><p>One might even say grossly unfair, and it is not even a game, it is
life & death stuff. Hence important to model you might think?</p><p>I do so think.</p><p>Unfortunately, the painfulness of model complexity starts to rare its
ugly time-sucking head. I need Godley Tables at this stage if for no
other reason that to avoid $\pm$ sign mistakes. But also to ensure
stock-flow consistency.</p><p>Our Model is now <strong>(Three+1)</strong>-Sector Model (sounds a bit Minkowski! Have
we gone relativistic?),
but still closed, or if you prefer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Workers</strong> = All workers domestic and foreign, but wages in NZD.<br><strong>Firms</strong> = All firms domestic and foreign, dealing in NZD.<br><strong>Government</strong> = NZ Government.<br><strong>Banks</strong> = agents of the state, but still in the Godley Tables.</p></blockquote><p>So the Bank sector is the &ldquo;+1&rdquo;.</p><p>This way we do not need to worry about imports and exports, they are taken
into account.</p><p>Although our Government does not explicitly insure <em>all</em> bank deposits,
they have a track record in propping up commercial banks, so <em>for all
intents and purposes</em> the banks are in the Government Sector, which is why
I&rsquo;d call this a (3+1) model.</p><h3 id=investment-31-sectors><a class=anchor href=#investment-31-sectors title='Anchor for: Investment (3+1) Sectors.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Investment (3+1) Sectors</h3><p>The investment function can now be more complicated. We considered
split private debt + loans. If we had two sectors suffering different
interest rates they would just split the term into Loan and Debts,
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D) & = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_d D + i_g D_g\\
\text{into},\qquad \mathcal{I} &= \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D + i_g D_g \\
\end{align*}
$$
where $F_L$ are the Firm loans, and $F_D$ are the Firm debts. But this
would very soon almost necessitate introducing Godley Tables to keep the
loan and debt ledgers balanced, which means banking. I want to delay this
modelling for now, so we will bookmark it as something to do.</p><p>As before, $D_g$ is government debt, so is the interest-earning asset of
the Firms and Workers now. Though I was not sure if all of $D_g$ should go
to Investment. Probably we should split this using a savings propensity,
$s_g$. Then,
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta \mathcal{I} &\sim (1 -s_g) i_g D_g \\
\Delta S &\sim s_g i_G D_g
\end{align*}
$$
and so,
$$
\mathcal{I}(\pi, D_g) = \mathcal{I}(\pi) - i_L F_L - i_d F_D +
(1-s_g) i_gD_g
$$</p><p>OK, but this means we have to put $s_gi_GD_g$ somewhere else. Obviously in
Firm and Worker deposits, $F_D$, $W_D$. But how much of the share? Should
we just use the monopoly parameter $\sigma$ from before? Or add another
knob to twiddle? Well, this depends on thee size of the firm I guess, so
it will require a new parameter. But is is something we should have
empirical data to guide us.</p><p>From the <a href=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/NZL target=_blank>IMF datamapper</a>
we can get $D_g$ and the interest paid on $D_g$.
But not the sector breakdown, for which we might need to dig into RBNZ data.
But in lieu of that, there is a split of all
&ldquo;private debt, loans and securities&rdquo;. That might include Tsy securities,
I am not sure, but the indicator or ratio aught to be a fair proxy for the
share of government interest-income.</p><div class=scroll tabindex=0><table><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Debt, loans, securities</th><th>% GDP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>Private</td><td>161.32</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Household</td><td>91.61</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Nonfinancial</td><td>60.71</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Let&rsquo;s conjure up a symbol for this ratio, say

some NZ economic data. A few series we will like are bank deposits,

I will test over on the <a href=/ohanga-pai/empirical/100_00_nzecon/#bank-data-rbnz>data chapter</a>

our Godley Tables: bank liabilities=<strong>S40</strong>, which used to be <strong>C17</strong>

But all trade balances can be converted to NZD, and New Zealand operates
a floating exchange rate. So we care not about foreign flows of finance.
They are part of the NZ economy at large.</p><p><strong>What we Lose?</strong><br>With this <strong>Three+1</strong> model we cannot model the impact of foreign capital flows
on the government policy and price level. This is a major flaw in the event
of a foreign monopolist marking-up their price, especially today Crude Oil.</p><p>OK, but we&rsquo;d have to manually adjust the Foreign Import price variable
anyway, it&rsquo;s not a market reaction function easily modelled. Thus I&rsquo;m going
to put off modelling the Foreign Sector and the exchange rate
entirely until much later on.</p><p>Also, note we do not have a single exchange rate, the NZD floats with
respect to all currencies. So this external sector modelling truly is
a nightmare. It&rsquo;s just worth noting what analysis we lose as a result.</p><ul><li>No response to forex movements.</li><li>No response to import prices, especially crude oil.</li><li>No response to capital flows.
So we will have to try to capture such variables in some other fashion, by
using empirical data, just like the Meteorological Office uses weather
balloon and satellite data as inputs to revise weather forecasts.</li></ul><p>One way to kludge this is to have an arbitrary factor adjustment in the
price level that does an &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; adjustment to all three above
factors. Supposing we do this by just looking at the CPI, or PCE, then
our model would be empirical and would be only &ldquo;good&rdquo; to a few weeks out.</p><h3 id=government-debt><a class=anchor href=#government-debt title='Anchor for: Government Debt.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Government Debt</h3><p>To model government bonds, or $D_g$ we could simplify a bit, since
we really only need to increase the effects of $i_B$ and $i_g$ to an
equivalent effective $i^\ast_B$=interest
on bank deposits. What I mean is,</p><blockquote><p>$i_B^\ast\cdot (F_D + W_D)$ is functionally the same as $i_B\cdot(F_D+W_D) + i_g\cdot D_g$.</p></blockquote><p>This is an extreme form of what Mosler says: banks are agents of the State.</p><p>This is because it is functionally the same whenever the
government insures bank deposits, which maybe despite neoliberal threats, is
typically the case these days post-GFC. The government bond is only
different in that it gets booked as &ldquo;Government Debt&rdquo; rather than
Bank Liabilities. In a stable country like NZ there is a legal and
psychological difference, but no practical difference (except in behavioural
response functions, which of course do matter, but we will not worry since we have
no clue what the behaviours will be, yet).</p><p>The psychological difference is that government bonds are considered more
secure, less risky. All the risk is at the margins for traders, and who
cares for them? Not me. They&rsquo;re not the people feuling the real economy.
()Actually we might care, since they are the parasites. But I will care later.)</p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO

of human lives (or at least some sort of dopiness needing elimination &mdash;
