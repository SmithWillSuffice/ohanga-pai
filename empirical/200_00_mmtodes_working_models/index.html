literature research.</p><p>For our first Model we will start with a pretty crappy ODES, it is
nothing more than a crude attempt to put some words into the form of ODE&rsquo;s.
I literally did next to no thinking for this.</p><p><strong>MMM</strong> refers to Monetary Minsky Model. Although this one for starters
does not have much money, we have no Godley Tables.</p><p><strong>Exercise (a bad model):</strong> First have a look at
<a href=../../files/bad_mmm_0.toml download>this toml file here</a>,
and see if you can figure out why it is a bit dopey. Hint: the dynamical
variables should be independent.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Well, I did write that file, but I knew it was bad, because
I did not think about it, and there might even be some dimensional
inconsistencies. However, the thing which struck me next was that Price $P$
labour $\lambda$, and wages $u$, determine output $Y$. So we can turn that
ODES into a $(P, u, \lambda)$ model, I reckon. Just using a few definitions.</p><p><strong>Modifications:</strong> for pedagogical purposes I am going to display some
toml files I&rsquo;ve not generated code for, you can bother about code
generation, but I&rsquo;d counsel not to waste your time. This first chapter
is just theory. We will get to some models we trust in theory enough to
bother generating and running the code later on. &lsquo;and for this first fix
we need some definitions.</p><p>The new toml spec. is:</p><div class=highlight><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nx>TODO</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>The model is structurally similar to a simple Goodwin model. We have, $\dot{u}$ (which is <code>f_u</code> in the spec. file), and $\dot{\lambda}$ (which is <code>f_lambda</code>)
written in the Goodwin forms:
<span id=eq_GoodwinDesai_model>$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{u} & = -c u + u f(\lambda) \\
\dot{\lambda} & = a \lambda - \lambda g(u)
\end{align*}
$$</span></p><p><strong>Exercise: (Sanity Check)</strong> For a start, examine this model and check it
makes sense. I do not even recall if I had all $\pm$ signs correct, so you
can really treat this specification as total raw and ready for pounding.</p><p><strong>Exercise: (Asymptotics):</strong> Now check that appropriate asymptotic
dependence is being modelled. Nothing should be &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo;. Note: the
exponential grow for $A(t)$ is blowing up, but at a slow rate. You could
replace the exponential with a sigmoidal function. Try this and see if the
short run output significantly differs.</p><hr><p>In pedagogical spirit I thought we could proceed as follows:</p><ul><li>mmm-0.1 Add an investment function $\mathcal{I}(u)$, but using
&ldquo;primitive debt&rdquo; (no accounting variables) but with a price level.</li><li>mmm-0.2 Try to enforce sectoral balance some way.</li><li>mmm-0.3 Add the banking sector and accounts, so we can model
sectoral balances correctly, and debt &\ credit will be treated
monetarily, instead of primitively.</li></ul><p>What do I mean by &ldquo;primitive credit/debt&rdquo;? I do not really know, it
is just a model choice before we get the proper Godley tables. But I
guess you can think of it in monetary terms, just without accounting
records?</p><h3 id=refinement--01><a class=anchor href=#refinement--01 title='Anchor for: Refinement&ndash;0.1.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Refinement&ndash;0.1</h3><p>As an exercises, create your own model that adds an Investment
function $I(t)$. From this we can use the price model which gives $P$,
so derive Savings and Investment in nominal terms. With no Foreign Sector
yet (to come much later). Then in turn we will have a way to enforce
Sectoral Balance. But what is sectoral balance with just a closed economy?
What two sectors are there?</p><p>(Well, you can see where this must lead: in the later refinement we will
need to include government variables, $(G, T, \tau_r, i_G)$ &mdash; for
spending, tax return, tax rate, policy interest rate. Or some similar
minimum set.)</p><p>In the one I develop next I will us <em>primitive debt.</em> And the model
dynamic variables will be $(P, D, u, \lambda)$.</p><p>Or $(P, D, u, \lambda, A, N)$ for longer runs when productivity and
population, $A(t)$, $N(t)$, advance.</p><p>Crucially, &ldquo;debt&rdquo; will be private debt (we&rsquo;re ignoring government for
now, recall! &mldr; while we remove our toddlers wheels). This is bad of us.
We will not have <code>mmm-1.0</code> until we get a government.</p><p><em>Rate of change of Debt</em> (flow) is Investment
less Profits from sales,
$$
\frac{dD}{dt} = I - \Pi
$$</p><p><strong>Profit equation:</strong> What about this? It will depend on sales less
interest on debt and labour costs,
$$
\Pi = Y - w\cdot L - i_d\cdot D
$$
To avoid the pedants piling upon us, at this stage &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; means
workers plus energy. But we&rsquo;re not going to worry for now about where
energy comes from! It&rsquo;s &ldquo;free&rdquo;, maybe from the Sun. This is of course
terrible modelling, since oil prices for starters are a huge source
of price instability (not so much production, since the lights will
still go on, you just increase the price, but maybe an add to
unemployment if import energy prices go up). We&rsquo;ll say domestic energy,
like food, is just part of output $Y$.</p><p>You can suppose there are primitive banks charging the interest
$i_d$ fee.</p><h4 id=investment-curve-mathcali><a class=anchor href=#investment-curve-mathcali title='Anchor for: Investment Curve ($\mathcal{I}$).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Investment Curve ($\mathcal{I}$)</h4><p>This is getting into some deep Keynes! But we can keep it simple.
To model an upwards (Minsky) instability we want Debt to grow with
investment if investment gets too wild, but we have that already. What
we need next is an investment response function that depends on profit
to the capitalist/investor class.</p><p><strong>Power Law Model:</strong><br>A prototype model is,
<span id=eq_investment_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}(\pi) = \frac{I}{Y} = \frac{a_i}{(b_i + c_i\cdot\pi)^{\gamma_i}} - d_i.
\end{equation}
$$</span>
This defines the <em>reduced investment function</em> $\mathcal{I}$. In our simple
model it is a function of a single variable, the <em>reduced profit rate</em>,
$\pi$, defined by,
<span id=eq_profit_reducedrate>$$
\begin{equation}
\pi = \frac{I}{Y} = \frac{\Pi}{\nu Y} = \frac{\Pi}{K}
\end{equation}
$$</p><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of new free parameters above in $\mathcal{I}$! But I have
not found ways to
derive investment&ndash;profit relations theoretically yet, so I will suck
this up.</p><p>We probably should not regard the exponent $\gamma_i$ as a parameter,
since the power law is a structural constant, which likely could be
theoretically fixed by macroeconomics theory, no modelling or data
fitting required, a lot like a critical exponent for phase transitions.
But to my knowledge no one has ever done this, and probably no one ever
needs to, since empirical uncertainty swamps most such nuances. We can
take the exponent to be $\gamma_i = 2$, without too much debate.</p><p>But if you have any objection do let me know.</p><p><strong>General Exponential Model:</strong><br>As an alternative to the power law, we can use tamer asymptotics
by using a General Exponential response function:
<span id=eq_investment_genexp_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\text{GenExp}(x) \quad =
(b - m) \exp\left[ \frac{s(x - a)}{b - m}\right] + m
\end{equation}
$$</span>
I sometimes write this $\text{GenExp}(x; a,b,s,m)$ to emphasize the
independent vaiable $x$ and the four parameters. The <em>function definition</em>
(not the function itself) is a function of the parameters and $x$.
What values of the constant four parameters you choose is a model decision.
Both can be fit to empirical data.</p><p>You select the constants $(a,b,s,m)$ then you have yourself a particular
function $\text{MyGenExp}(x)$.</p><p>We can use this general form for both Phillips curve and Investment
function responses, since both are upwards curving monotonic functions
of their single argument.</p><p>Even at this early stage you thus might wonder if we are not building
a Ptolemaic Epicycles ODE system?</p><p>My defences is that we are not, provided the relations we model are
based on real world institutional arrangements. It is not out fault in this
regard that we are unaware of all the structural constants. But think about
it! Political economy is not like the Weather or Celestial Mechanics, or even
the carbon atom. It is far more complex, and human beings have socially
constructed our economic systems with oodles of these parameters! All the
multitude of parameters are in fact real. You can see how many there are by
browsing the legal Statutes.</p><p>So we are in fact building a highly parsimonious model, becuas ee we
will use far fewer arbitrary constants than there are in the real world
macroeconomy. To a physicists, this is just one of the annoying things
about macroeconomics. It&rsquo;s a hot mess of Rube&ndash;Goldberg knobs and dials.</p><p><strong>Capital Growth Function ($\Gamma$):</strong><br>Sometimes it is nicer to think of investment in terms of capital growth,
$\Gamma$, which is <em>defined</em> as,
<span id=eq_capital_growth_rate>$$
\Gamma = \frac{\dot K}{K}
$$</span>
Introducing capital depreciation, $\delta$, a linear response function
for this is,
$$
\Gamma = \frac{1-u}{\nu} - \delta
$$
You can also try a different nonlinear parameterization using two
different constants, $\omega_K $ and $\bar{u}$, as follows
$$
\Gamma(u) = \omega_K \ln\left[ \frac{\bar{u} - u}{1 - u} \right] - \delta
$$

before we try to get government into the model we can begin with a
simpler mode of &ldquo;cost + markup&rdquo;. The markup uses a monopoly parameter,
but expressed instead as a <em>monopolists share</em> parameter $\sigma$.
The more the monopoly power, the more the markup, the less the wage
share, the worker share being $(1-\sigma)$. For the
rate of change we use a time constant, $\tau_P$.</p><p>How to use it? Well, wages $w$, and wage share is $u = w/A$. Equilibrium
is when worker share equals wage share,
$$
(1-\sigma) P - u = 0
$$
so that will be proportional to $(1-\sigma) \dot{P}$ for deviations away
from equilibrium. But what is the proportionality factor? Well, since $u$
and $P$ are currency units, or at least implied to be so, we need to divide
by a time period. This will be the out-of-equilibrium time constant, which
is typically a year to six months adjustment, though it can be empirically
fitted later if need be, so that&rsquo;s our parameter, $0.5 \le \tau_P \lt 1$.
Putting this together,
<span id=eq_price_markup_func>$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{1}{\tau_P}\left(\frac{u}{ 1- \sigma } - P\right)
\end{equation}
$$</span>
Empirical studies might suggest $\sigma \approx 0.2$.</p><p><strong>Exercise ($\Delta P$ sign):</strong> You might wish to check the sign is
correct. What happens if the capitalist takes everything?</p><p><strong>Capitalist takes all:</strong> $\Rightarrow$ $\sigma = 1$, and $\dot P \to +\infty$.
Correct. That&rsquo;s easier to understand in reverse cause: if the price is
set to $\infty$ the workers gets zilch. Of course this never happens
because capitalists want to sell at least something.</p><p><strong>Worker takes all:</strong> $\Rightarrow$ $\sigma = 0$, implies the price was
so low the workers could afford it all (this is all &ldquo;in the macro&rdquo; you
appreciate, not a single firm or anything). Then what happens?<br><strong>When $u &lt; P$ :</strong> then there is downwards price pressure, due to workers
unable to buy all the goods. Correct.<br><strong>When $u > P$ :</strong> the sales $P$ is a upwards price pressure, $\dot P > 0$,
due to high effective demand from $u$. Correct again.</p><p>In a market economy with government the currency monopoly, the
sectoral balance will be needed to get a proper price function. That&rsquo;s
because it is government spending $G$ which sets the price level.
We will leave this as a TODO later. (Especially because I&rsquo;ve never come
across dynamical models where this has been taken into considerations, and
I&rsquo;m still thinking about how best to model this.)</p><h4 id=phillips-curve-phi><a class=anchor href=#phillips-curve-phi title='Anchor for: Phillips Curve ($\Phi$).'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Phillips Curve ($\Phi$)</h4><p>Without explicit accounting systems, a Phillips Curve
is practically necessary in the model because we need some way to enforce
the constraint $0 \gt \lambda &lt; 1$. One way is to have a Phillips Curve
$\Phi(u)$ which diverges at $\lambda = 1$. The conventional form is,</p><span id=eq_phillips_curve>$$
\Phi(\lambda) = \frac{d}{(1 - \lambda)^\gamma} - c
$$</span>
A numerical problem with this form is that unlike an exponential, it
requires careful tuning of the constants, since they have dimensions, so
if you use arbitrary constants you risk ODE instability. That just means it
can be a little painful trial and error to get good constants.<p>How does this asymptotics work? Well, we need one of the derivatives to
also diverge at $\lambda = 1$. Which one? It is not going to be Debt or
Output ($Y$) right? A finite $L=N$ number of workers cannot generate
diverging output or debt for investors. Thus (in the present modelling) it
has to be in $\dot u$, in the wage share.</p><p><strong>Warning!</strong> One thing computationally you need to worry about is if you choose
a fractional $\gamma_p$, say $\gamam_p = 1.3$ and you do not have good
asymptotics for $\lambda$, since of $\lambda > 1$ you will get a root of
a negative number for the power law Phillips curve. While python can
handle that, the usual solvers from numpy, scipy or gnuScienceLib probably
do not work with complex functions, Julia would need a complex package,
but in both languages this is unlikely to play well with your ODE solver.
This is why $]\gamma_p = 2.0$ is &ldquo;numerically safe&rdquo; even if not perfectly
empirically accurate.</p><p>If you scroll back, you see we already had this correct
functional response in the wage share ODE $\dot u$,
(<a href=#eq_GoodwinDesai_model>see above</a>
) we just re-write it now using the
more suggestive symbol $\Phi$ for $f$ (they&rsquo;re the same thing):
$$
\dot{u} = u \cdot\bigl( c - \Phi(\lambda) \bigr)
$$</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> No need to write toml for this just yet, but have a think
about what you need to change to introduce a Job Guarantee labour
buffer?, hence full employment $\lambda = 1$ permanently. Hint: we still
need to use the Phillips curve with that divergence, otherwise we have
no buffer mechanics.</p><h4 id=employment-and-output><a class=anchor href=#employment-and-output title='Anchor for: Employment and Output.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Employment and Output</h4><p>Recall(?) these are not independent, so our model dynamical variables are
either $(\lambda, u, P, D)$ or $(Y, u, P, D)$. I usually go for $\lambda$
and think of output $Y$ as dependent on labour. But what is the substitution?</p><p>It is easiest for me to begin with a reasonable definition of output:
$$
Y = \lambda A N
$$
For <em>macroeconomics</em> that is a pretty hard & fast definition. Differentiating
using the product and quotient rules, we see,
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\dot Y}{Y} & = \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda} + \frac{\dot A}{A} + \frac{\dot N}{N} \\
& = \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda} + \alpha + \beta\\
\therefore\qquad \frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda}& =
\frac{\dot Y}{Y} - \alpha - \beta
\end{align*}
$$
The second line there is a short run model $A(t)$and $N(t)$ where can be
regarded as slow exponentials,
so basically linear. We really want them sigmoidal, but in all honesty who
knows where the inflexion point is? Even a linear function will suffice
from an empirical fit 0&mdash; which is because we never inted to run our MMT
models for more than a year or two. Why? I told you earlier: because it
would be silly to do so, every bit as silly as using a two week weather
forecast to extrapolate out to a year.</p><p>Anyhow, exponentials make it easier in this case since then
$\dot{A}/A = \alpha$, the productivity growth rate. Same for
$\dot N/N = \beta$, the population growth rate. Heck dude! You just manually
tweak these year-to-year as census data comes in. What else are you going
to do? Predict female birth propensity? Predict scientific innovation?
(No, and No.)</p><p>Now looking back at the
<a href=#eq_capital_growth_rate>capital growth rate</a>
, $\Gamma$, and noting
$Y = K/\nu$, we have $\dot Y/Y = \dot K/K$, hence can write,
<span id=eq_goodwin_lambda_ode>$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\dot \lambda}{\lambda} &= \Gamma(u) - \alpha - \beta \\
\therefore\qquad \frac{d\lambda}{dt} &= \lambda\cdot\left(\Gamma(u) - \alpha - \beta\right)
\end{align*}
$$</span>
Because we&rsquo;ve already defined $\Gamma(u)$ this is all, for now, for
the $\lambda$ equation. Later refinements will come when we consider
more complicated models.</p><h3 id=the-production-function-yk-l><a class=anchor href=#the-production-function-yk-l title='Anchor for: The Production Function $Y(K, L)$.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Production Function $Y(K, L)$</h3><p>The Leontief function is widely regarded as the simplest of the physically
well-justified models, assuming $L$ is labour + energy. This beggars
belief a bit, since energy adds to costs, hence price, but we&rsquo;re going to
ignore that for now. Note that presently our ODES does not incorporate
the Price ODE, even though we have one. It is autonomous, purely dependent
on the mechanics of the Cycle. This is because we have not incorporate
Government into the model yet, despite this being our grand ultimate
objective!</p><p>Anyhow,
$$
\text{Leontief:}\quad Y = \text{min} \left\{\frac{K(t)}{\nu}, A(t)L(t)\right\}
$$
but we&rsquo;ve been assuming $Y = K\nu$. This is justified as the
assumption of full utilization of capital: $K/\nu \approx L N$.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> What can you do if empirically you know this is not the case?
Say $K/\nu &lt; L N$? Doesn&rsquo;t that just mean you can redefine $\nu$?</p><p>In which case, you aught not lie about it, and you say we have a <em>structurally
effective</em> $\nu_\text{eff} &lt; \nu$, such that $LN=K/\nu_\text{eff}$. If you
are a policy person you might then
wish to research into why this is so, if you think the Leonteif model is ok.
But seriously, are you going to put research resources into this? The
macroeconomy is far too messy and gnarly to worry with this, I would say.</p><blockquote><p>What matters is full employment and decent livelihoods for all people.</p></blockquote><p>The MMT dynamics, and especially what the Price level is doing, are nothing
compared to this objective. And no ODE solver analysis is going to help you
achieve this objective. Hence, no, I don&rsquo;t care if the Leontief model is a
bit unrealistic.</p><p>That all said, I am going to save this Goodwin Model and run it to check
the software system is working.</p><h3 id=a-puzzle-----closing-the-ode><a class=anchor href=#a-puzzle-----closing-the-ode title='Anchor for: A Puzzle &mdash; Closing the ODE.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Puzzle &mdash; Closing the ODE</h3><p>While writing the first draft I had got to this point:
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot u &= u \cdot(c - \Phi(\lambda)) \\
\dot \lambda & = \lambda \cdot ( \Gamma(u) - \alpha - \beta ) \\
\dot D &= I - \Pi \\
\dot P &= \frac{1}{\tau_P} \cdot \left(\frac{u}{1 - \sigma} - P\right).
\end{align*}
$$
The price equation is nicely <em>in your face</em> there in large fractions! Sort
of perversely fitting, since it is the odd one out, it can be dropped and
we&rsquo;d still have a valid ODES. But I&rsquo;ve left it alone since maybe it is
nice to track &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; in simulation real-time.</p><p>Is this a well-defined ODES?
This is a nice student exercise.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Close the ODE system, that is, find the substitutions needed
to get all dynamical variables on the left in terms of known functions
of time $t$ or the current variables at time $t$, $\lambda(t), u(t)$ etc.
Hint: $\Gamma(u)$ is fine, that&rsquo;s a response function we have defined.</p><p><strong>Solution?:</strong> The difficulty I had was an apparent inconsistency, since
in back-tracking to compute investment $I$ and profit $\Pi$ for the $\dot D$
response, I had two different solutions. So I had to do some algebra
detective work to avoid a circularity or over-determination.</p><p>We had, I believe,
$$
I(\pi) = Y \cdot \mathcal{I}(\pi)
$$
which seems ok, since $\mathcal{I}(\pi)$ was that power law, or the GenExp
response function, it just depends on $\pi$. OK, but what is $\pi$?
We had,
$$
\pi = \frac{\Pi}{Y} = \frac{\Pi}{\lambda A N}
$$
that&rsquo;s ok. But I&rsquo;ve dropped the independent variables, since I forgot what
$\Pi$ depends upon. All we see there is $\pi = \pi(\lambda)$ which would be ok.
So what is $\Pi$? We had a practical definition,
$$
\begin{align*}
\Pi &= Y - uAL - i_d D \\
&= Y - uA^2 \lambda - i_d D
\end{align*}
$$
I think that&rsquo;s all, the end of the line. All three terms are now
consistently determined by $(u, \lambda, P, D)$, or really in this
simple model by $(u, \lambda, D)$.</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Check this is so. If it is not then fix it!</p><p>I myself will quit at this point and declare victory since life is too short.
Plus, my feelings for full employment do not care about my mathematics.</p><h4 id=productivity-squared><a class=anchor href=#productivity-squared title='Anchor for: Productivity Squared.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Productivity Squared</h4><p>This was the first time I noticed this modified Goodwin system depends
on $A^2$. A little nonlinearity. Where&rsquo;&rsquo;s the turning point I wondered?
Since $A(t)$ is growing slowly it is not too important, but I did wonder
if I&rsquo;d got the dimensions correct? That&rsquo;s hard to check without some Typing
(<em>data types</em>, not keyboard bashing).</p><p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Is the $A^2$ dependence correct there?</p><p>Should we spell out the $\dot D$ equation? Well, we now understand,
$$
\pi = \pi (\lambda, D)
$$
so we have got,
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dD}{dt} & = \lambda A N \mathcal{I}(\lambda, D) -\Bigl( \lambda A N - u A^2 \lambda - i_d D \Bigr)\\
& = \lambda A N \cdot\bigl( \mathcal{I}(\lambda, D) - 1\bigr) + u A^2 \lambda + i_d D
\end{align*}
$$
where,
$$
\mathcal{I}(\pi) = \frac{a_i}{(b_i + c_i \pi(\lambda, D))} - d_i.
$$
Is the full stop for real now?</p><p>Well, I doubt there are any cancellations to be made or anything, so yeah, I
think that&rsquo;s it for now.</p><h4 id=simulation-game-01><a class=anchor href=#simulation-game-01 title='Anchor for: Simulation Game-0.1.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Simulation Game-0.1</h4><p>This model <code>mmm-0.1</code> is worth running through the software package.</p><h3 id=refinement--02><a class=anchor href=#refinement--02 title='Anchor for: Refinement&ndash;0.2.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/ohanga-pai/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Refinement&ndash;0.2</h3><p><strong>Issue 1.</strong>
The clear issue I have with the above model is no clear sectoral balance,
since it is a One Sector model (a closed PK circuit).</p><p><strong>Issue 2.</strong> I want the government as currency monopolist to get a proper
MMT system. So we need to change the Price equation, and put the price level
into the dynamics somehow, at a minimum as a policy response pressure.</p><p><strong>Issue 3.</strong> In my Goodwin model from about a decade ago, I saw that I wrote an
investment function. It used a depreciation parameter $\delta$, but this was
not automatically guaranteeing sectoral balance consistent. So today I am
trying a different way to get an investment function. Since $I$ is in the
Sectoral Balance, we can simply make it a dependent variable. Drop the
depreciation parameters $\delta$, and instead us a savings desires
parameter $s$ (same thing, from a different point of view&mldr; well, roughly).
I think this is advantageous, since savings desires are measurable, while
depreciation is a dodgy parameter (possibly reasonably constant, but hard
to quantify).</p><p>You recall what this is? <em>Sectoral balances always sum to zero.</em></p><span id=two_sector_balance>$$
