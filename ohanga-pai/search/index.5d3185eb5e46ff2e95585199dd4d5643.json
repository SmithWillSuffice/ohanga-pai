[{"content":"itching for scrap here am going combat some of daniel neilsons substack posts soon parted not because disagree but because find daniels blog informative but lacking mmt lens but he gets lot right is student of mehrlings so he understands balance sheets whatnot so daniel nielson we are not dealing some unhinged libertarian or austrian school fantasist as we mentioned on mmt macro trader livestream jan 2023 it is good have dissension field of knowledge that is uncertain this is not because of some warped analogy darwinism but rather more explicit we know political economy is generated by imperfect human beings so we know it is not probably ever going be settled body of theory like say physics finance politics politics is art of governing economics is fair distribution of output while finance is study of using currency system records of credits debits political economy of finance daniels morocco substack post series these three get merged this is hazardous because of several contradictions when theory is exposed real world will talk about few of these finance is corruptible because power of who governs is source of corruption governors of financial system are open corruption finance politics must address not just reality of mmt but also way monetary system is abused result of such abuses is breakdown of goal of fair distribution economics one source of corruption is failure recognize that we do not live pure capitalist system all major nations today have currency monopoly it is public monopoly government as issuer of currency this is something nielson does not lead maybe deliberately cannot tell but it is poor pedagogy nielson begins instead pure capitalism gross idealization phrase business that specializes credit we can call bank true but government also specializes credit \u0026mdash tax credit \u0026mdash is called parliament or congress not bank government will however create special type of bank central bank which has principle function of regulating payments system for currency states unit of account fact government is so powerful banks end up asking for licences from state use states tax credits for their credit sequence is vital understand is similar warren moslers sequence sequence here is first state issues tax liabilities then second they issue currency which functions as tax credit that which can be redeemed for extinguishing tax liabilities governments are not all stupid they retain monopoly on issuance exogenous currency injections allow private banks only capacity extend credit endogenous currency injections once idiots get voted into parliaments who do not understand this system even then sequence stays same monetary system is highly robust against idiots running it but unfortunately justice system fair distribution are not so robust being licenced by state these private banks are effectively doing bidding of state issuing private credit fuel entrepreneurs who ned finance capital start or expand businesses prior having sales streams this sounds like important function of capitalism but this is not capitalism qua marx socialist system can also have banks issuing private expansion credit \u0026mdash but whom if business owners no longer exist worker cooperatives so this is myth no.1 needing busting function of private credit expansion has nothing intrinsically do class system of owners of firms first class citizens versus ii workers second class citizens balance sheets third part of lectures notes nielson describes how balance sheets are used run credit system description is good bolster our myth bust we note nielsons high level view of balance sheets t-accounts does not mention class system is there really borrower tell me if this is too pedantic on nielsons explanations of balance sheets we see lender bank\u0026quot borrower credit borrowed is recorded on each entities balance sheet whats wrong here it is macroeconomic perspective think th banking system as whole needs be referenced macro analysis when borrower takes credit it almost instantly transactions delays permitting becomes liability of baking system \u0026mdash deposit this deposit came form nowhere \u0026mdash which is flowery rhetoric for fact bank just created it on balance sheet nothing printed by government no gold supply raided no tax payer shafted it is endogenous money story loan created deposit there really is no borrower commonsense meaning of word since nothing borrowed* what happened is that credit\u0026ndashdebt set of records created it is relationship between three parties not two customer of bank buyer bank seller of goods also customer of some bank usually absent drug lords etc customer buyer got credit they can spend asset but have repay liability bank got promise repay bank asset but also deposit seller of goods banked payment seller got rid of assets real assets gained credit deposit those are six balance sheet entries minimum central bank has not get got involved our story but are background adding two more balance sheet entries regarding movements of reserves at end of settlement period it is as randall wray now steve keen would recognize not just quadruple entry book-keeping but octuple beware ideals \u0026mdash capitalism is not capitalism final statement for first moroccan series is purpose of this course is help us understand system of credit relationships by doing so better understand capitalism itself as said nielson is smart dude teaches well but here he is teaching folks about system that does not exist if we only focus on endogenous money operations we ignore most important institution whole system monopoly issuer government time repeat warren moslers pithy definition of mmt mmt is recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof libertarians anarchists might not like this knowledge but too bad it is system we face today question is whether or not justice for oppressed can be found within such system or similar but reformed system or whether all government needs be torn down begun again from grass roots if latter is your proposal you face serious questions about how achieve it non-violently securing justice will now be generous optimistic if you are prepared tolerate intellectual violence think nature function of democratic government is both reformable can be revolutionized many ways without physical violence intellectual warfare spiritual warfare \u0026mdash nature of which is not analogous physical war weapons of spiritual war are love kindness not hate intolerance this is stuff neilson most other writers on macroeconomics leave out of almost all their analysis it makes their efforts all weaker when you prepare go into such war choose your weapons wisely pissing people off for sake of it is not good weapon gaining allies is how do you do that will deliberately leave that one dangling if you take up social media trolling tool called keyboard my advice is not troll neoliberals you really want them stop think not unfollow you so give them something chew on vicinity of cognitive dissonance this is what douglas hopelessly materialistic nice guy over at mmt macro trader is trying do we need soldiers this army help which is why am helping douglas explore mmt implications at mesoeconomic level any intellectual fuel can provide mind-bomb neliberals is fuel worth effort of

Politics"},{"content":"one good thing about joining douglas mmt trader is that get exposed now trolls critics who want debunk mmt this might be fodder for several posts so this is part-1 am not going launch into esoteric philosophy money crankery so dont be scared my approach is more mathematical sciences lets be generous call macroeconomics social science there is theory empirical data test it just not always conclusively so we can formulate definitions theorems using definitions then test them if you think we cannot then you are on another planet like yanis varoufakis we cannot easily communicate my friend seriously though what yanis says is that we cannot replicate trials so economics is not like other sciences but social sciences have always been this way you cannot lab replicate entire human culture science is however not defined by needs replicated control trials rcts are only one method available science if rcts are not available you have test theories models other ways which can be done it is just not as easy besides which rcts are controlled real world is often not so rcts cannot ever constitute all of empirics science is economics science what varoufakis gets correct is that lot of professional economists are fact not engaged any science this he would agree someone like steve keen who would also say mainstream neoclassical school of economics is not science what is it then answer is that it is mathematical theory if formulated consistently it violates common presumptions real world real people are not rational have poor capacity maximize their subjective utility utility as neoclassical must non-circularly define it when it is formulated idealized axioms neoclassicals want believe are true real world theory can fact become inconsistent neoclassical axioms imply there is no stable price vector${}^\\dagger$ so for these few other reasons neoclassical economics is fictional fantasy if consistent it is not applicable real world if inconsistent then it is invalid every possible world that is what you call diabolical piece of mathematics waste of human intellect like string theory that proves strings are inconsistent ${}^\\dagger$see john blatt dynamic economic systems definitions give formal semantics idea of definition is convey meaning but this is only possible if we are communicating some sentient conscious knower if not then we are just formalising our thinking for ourselves but that can be worthwhile thing do define what you mean make it record then you can have what wittgenstein thought impossible private language if someone uses different definition for word say money us then we have possibility of needless debate argument do not wish engage that sort of thing so if you are going communicate meaningfully us as mmt aware activists you will need either accept temporarily our definitions or lay-out your own beg us temporarily explore yours mmt we have simple enough definition of money money is iou of issuer whatever issuer promises redemption for iou dictates perhaps subjectively value of money what it is worth you how much effort you will be prepared obtain their iou notice no such thing as bank is yet mentioned money can indeed exist without banks but iou does require some sort of record keeper even if it is you keeping record your head real world these are normally banks or one of functions of banks we then have new term define for state currency or state money state currency is iou of state which for normative purposes mmt defines be tax credit that which is accepted as redemption for payment of tax liabilities state owes you redemption of one unit of tax liability when you receive their currency tokens this is one reason among others but primary reason why you accept states currency payments am not talking about psychologically why you accept dollars rather than gold or bitcoin most of you accept dollars because everyone else does so understand that you have know macroeconomics because there is no way as whole society will accept worthless bits of paper for payments system as whole knows something backs state currency as soon as they learn it is not gold stored fort knox they realize it is pure state power it is not by genial social agreement state can use gold as fig leaf of course hide naked reality of their fiat currency should they feel need do so mmter would not need them too enjoying full naked splendour bloody perverts phrase money is ambiguous since it can refer tokens or account records or units of records unit of account provided you appreciate there is this ambiguity we will allow you talk us using word money if it is clear enough from context which meaning you are employing few other definitions axioms simple postulates that we agree need not be proven which will not belabour by writing them all down see theory mmt can now claim few corollaries one is that it now matters great deal whether you can get tax credits only from government or only from private banks or both because bankers can be tiny little assholes about their tightness on credit why because governments deem them insolvent if they cannot cover their liabilities how frickin dare that government encroach upon beautiful efficiency of private sector all going making currency valuable all it matters also because if governments allow themselves emit their own tax credits then demos has some measure of protection from predatory bankers also government itself is now not beholden pecuniary interests of private bankers it seems me this is sociologically extremely important note positive money activists why would government \u0026mdash as governors \u0026mdash refuse allow themselves ability issue their own tax credits why am even bothering ask question mmt is thus not merely accounting money story which is political story makes huge f-ing difference if you get it wrong you can get mired austerity politics all sorts of other abuses crimes against humanity allowing involuntary unemployment all for no good reason but ignorance can give you warren moslers pithy summary of money treasury bond price stories all nutshell which is as succinct statement that can find pointing out mmt is much more than mere accounting warren wrote its mmt recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof see implications are truly profound you only need dip your toe mmt literature then you will see there is whole lot of depth that pool you cannot grok it all day just at least take look at mosler\u0026#39s proposals here for starters what about bank money lets see banks issue credit which is your promise repay not banks bank allows you create your own official iou amazingly you can pay your tax liabilities it even better some idiot down road running grocery store will accept this give you groceries for it arent banks marvellous also unit is state currency which means what bank issues is always iou of state we are not talking about corporate paper here either but even that is also denominated states unit of account dollar yen euro so banks are offering you yom \u0026mdash you owe me which is functionally just inverse of iou how heck can they do this it is because they are licenced use states unit of account so when you take bank credit now being debt bank you are nonetheless credit government who will always accept your currency receipt of tax payment this is why you can always use your bank money purchase goods why else do you take on debt bank seller will take your filthy bank money because them it is functionally exactly same as clean green government issued currency they may indeed pay off their tax liabilities fraction of your purchase problem here is commercial banking system private banks are not currency monopoly so you can certainly pay off your tax liabilities but then you still owe bank or theyll take your house off you or whatever you implicitly or explicitly offered as collateral but why why can bank not pay itself do really have say why they are licenced regulated by state anyone heard of jail for fraud laws anyone so this is very different states currency operations but it is using same unit of currency bank cannot operate without government around impose liabilities that by force drive demand for otherwise worthless state currency they can then issue their yoms but only because state permits this now some mmters say this means private banks are acting as agents of state this is true but it is only definition of what it means be one type of agent people get all uptight lose their marbles over this but it is just definition if you do not like saying banks are agents of state then call them something else it does not change reality of monetary system operations banks cannot function by issuing their own money if they try issue iou theyll pretty soon run out of takers try it yourself \u0026mdash is possible taunt every cryptocurrency nutter ever tragedy of that is that cryptocurrency early adopters did make billions all at expense of late-comers it continues be bit of tragedy like going casino tax on stupidity but big gain for borderline criminals modern day charles ponzis reason why banks are not running ponzi schemes aside from fraudulent bankers is because they are government regulated they must satisfy solvency capital requirements or state shuts them down this is very strongly enforced one thing governments are finicky about enforcing as counterfeit if state loses this power then its currency demand drops zero but then so will banks why people troll mmt \u0026mdash positive money all that one reason we find lot of trolls making rude or obnoxious comments on mmt related content on social media is because they are using different semantics different definitions if you define money as account records emitted by private banks only by private banks then it is debateable whether this can be considered state currency however if state accepts bank created records as redemption for tax liabilities then state is cooperation private banks making it be so by law that bank credit is state currency or state might say you need units of bank credit redeem one unit of their tax liabilities they usually do not but they could that would then be dual money system but trivially so conversion factor you could very well just assume you have pay double tax you used denominated private money tokens total bananas but guess pigs could grab jet packs fly trolling over definitions people troll mmt because they think their definition is one only true definition it is bit infantile because definitions only matter when they are employed theorize or model so if you can come up model where dominant monetary form region is bank credit issued only by private banks governments are only getting on action by imposing tax liabilities denominated bank currencies then you have some grounds argue against mmt theory mmt says state currency is unit of account of state created by law of land not by banks banks can however obtain licences operate credit facilities from state this is fact objectively true if one examines law any nation that has state currency driven by taxation banking payments system it is not only by law either old fashioned ledger books conformed today software systems banks use have be licenced they implement mmt operations pure simple this can be empirically tested it has been so now we have opportunity for departures theories based upon definitions we can ask do governments need borrow credit from banks which they have repay interest order get state currency into government account books why do banks allow government vote issue more of banks currency or rather why does government army police force permit private weakling banks dictate credit supply even pose these questions is conceding principle these are not applicable questions you can ask them but answers are trivial answers are that governments never borrow from banks governments never take orders from banks it is other way around but if you want appear insane test your sanity we can examine software accounting law practices check see if you are posing sensible question you will find you are not governments of any reasonable sized population define their currency permit banks operate as private payments deposit holding services like our bus system wellington new zealand which is publicly licenced but privately run for profit \u0026mdash they could not operate without our city councils approval philosophically is private public service provider really private sector or are they really public sector answer is it depends upon your definitions so do not be nerd if someone says otherwise what you think here one definition public service contractors are private sector when they clock off work public sector when they are on job if government is contracting them this might not be your definition see if it matters you have check what is legally enforceable what workers rights do contractors have are they civil service protections or private sector wild west notice we have already crossed over into mmt land because we are talking about account records not gold governments most of them anyway have no interest anymore gold fort knox usa viewed as backing for us dollar is charade it is store of gold that might be used for future space travel optoelectronics but that is all these days it never gets shipped around any significant amounts back any payments system this signed by law 1930s when usa stopped redeeming for gold domestically then again 1972 when usa stopped charade of bretton-woods quasi gold standard but really based on us dollar but usa technically still promising redemption gold up until 1972 no longer. will concede ground our frenemy rob on comments sections${}^\\ddagger$ that gold is moved around how about that people do elevator it up out of fort knox back down hole ground moscow why if it is not for electrical engineering or high-end consumer electronics factory ${}^\\ddagger$i do not want slander real rob so hereby make strawman rob who will name niels rob or niels bor danish or niels bohr he takes copenhagen interpretation of quantum currency its gold am einstein taking realist account of state currency tax credit notice we are already stupid both since we have different definitions but idea is determine if there are real world consequences that can be tested like epr experiment bohr is considered have won this debate ok rob apologies physicists who would recognize have einstein bohr backwards this analogy credit is entangled debt gold cannot be entangled but read my t4gu pages see why einstein knew about entanglement better than bohr ultimate end er=epr my dudes partly rubes need this charade that something physical real stuff man backs currency you know otherwise they might not find someone willing purchase their wares someones promising gold for redemption right satisfying rubes is time-honoured tradition it is unknown whether putin understood any of this he might be one of those rubes thinking moscow better stick gold under ground or rouble might collapse permafrost you see any case gold bullion does get shipped around from time-to-time keep these rubes sleeping at night mean horror what if people lost all credit records havent you seen mr robot you cant be giga-chad if you do not own gold my dudes ultimately though there could be method putins madness if you have some idea gold price is going go up dollar units you can meddle your foreign exchange rate by selling gold you bought cheaper your currency yen euro rouble again can give some battle ground niels bohr here if russia desires fixed exchange rate thereby signal they want help their export oligarchs screw their domestic workers over than theyll try maintain some foreign exchange rate target they decide is satisfactory for exporters this will not help them win military conflict however so really do not know what putin is thinking he has workers energy steel they can make bullets why do they give toss about forex rate they could be rubes or they could think this is form of psychological warfare because foreign state officials also believe gold is currency rather than buffer stock who knows it is possible some utter catastrophe could destroy all branches of us government then irs might stop functioning demand for usd collapse zero water or coffee beans or gold might become medium of exchange for while until new government tax authority enforcement is formed before then fort knox might get raided whoever raids most might find themselves as new monopoly issuer of private currency records that it promises redeem for gold adults not being adults making misery for masses love or love laugh at pedants who say this is why mmt is null when exactly do they think usa will collapse sure it could happen but until it does us dollar system is well-described by mmt same here new zealand for nzd mean seriously when aussies run out of fertile soil desalinated water we will fight on beaches trolling over positive money class positive money cranks as different sort of troll they tend have their hearts right place but their conceptions of money are so poor they can be hazard public good consciousness but here have create strawman because have failed meet positive money theorist wild had one roped online for day but they gave up on me gave up on me hell must be non-redeemable cult however am prepared build this strawman out of wikipedia this one is for uk but substitute bank of england for any central bank you get positive money for any country positive moneys historical backbone proposal is introduce sovereign money system under such reform private banks would be deprived from their ability create money by extending credit into economy turn bank of england would regain monopoly over money creation by financing governments budget monetary financing or distributing citizens dividend helicopter money group however refutes any affiliation modern monetary theory \u0026mdash downloaded 2023-01-02 they are right refute affiliation mmt because mmt would say lol uk already have sovereign currency they just do not know it act like they do not have boe created money it is fair think say uk monetary system looks like private bank mafiosi but appearances are deceptive it is bankers mafia only because government wants it be why does any foreign power accept libor warren moslers suggestion steer fifth fleet up thames tell them what interest rate will be all private banks uk have all obtained their ukp equity from past uk government deficits so money all came from uk government it never silver or gold political issue positive money activists have correct is that uk monetary system is heavily influenced by private banks their credit creation authority that authority comes from uk government not private bank cartel but this is only legal business it is uk government permitting all these bank credit facilities be operated on uk soil we are not talking about shadow banking here which may also not be sufficiently regulated but whatever shadow banking is it is not credit creation it is strictly loaning deposits which is not bank credit creation thus if positive money activists are only arguing that uk government should better assert its actual existing power as currency monopolist help stop lower income people from going into bank debt then they can be affiliated mmt because all mmt aware people know would agree that is objective of all enlightened current activism over injustices of banking system but you have then also understand mmt job guarantee truly see proper fix for base problem unfortunately strawman positive money activists go overboard conspiracy story${}^\\ast$ also fail understand that there is always debtor whenever there is creditor so positive money is fiction you cannot create positive money it is inapplicable notion because all money is iou of issuer otherwise it is not money issuer has debt obligation promise redeem receiver has credit ${}^\\ast$ do not quite see how government that wants empower private banks credit creation rather than government issue is conspiracy it is at least conspiracy conducted broad daylight crime against humanity am possibly even more insistent it is human rights crime than positive money people \u0026mdash because know government does not need any new laws stop banker mafia if you cannot see broad daylight how am aid you if there is no promise redeem you have not got currency you have ponzi scheme like bitcoin giving back bank of england monopoly lol mmt law scholarship \u0026mdash integral part of mmt reveals central banks are already branches of government governments are already currency monopolists they regulate private banks they just need do it better so people need are never debt job guarantee policy no private bank ever should have seat at jg policy table private bankers interest is getting people into debt that serves no public purpose unless firm wants be debt expand their green sustainable business \u0026mdash should be rule here positive money people would agree hooray somehow positive money theorists got spurious idea their heads that governments are beholden private banks perhaps that is due perverse way government treasury departments play smoke mirrors conceal fact that on balance sheets they are already creating currency every time they spend no private bank sight but usa at least they put private bank bond dealer middle of road as fake this is truly how money creation by government is run it is charade government is currency sovereign already we know reasons for this too it is ideological neoliberals conservatives can never countenance thought government issues currency by marking-up bank accounts they want rich people be privileged tax-payer funded myth see raúl carrillos superb piece here or youtube discussion here be fair it easy write spurious notion that governments are beholden private banks into your head \u0026mdash simply read orthodox economics textbook fake knowledge yet how currency operations are abused matters doubt governments wanting abuse monetary system would ever dream of voting positive money proposals this is same criticism mmt enjoys \u0026mdash even if mmt describes system well who is there force governments run job guarantee lower interest rates zero no neoliberal know of for damn sure if we thus want bank of england use monopoly power it already has conjunction uk parliament we have use force of democracy educated population presently that means understanding mmt you can also take look at positive money proposals see which seem reasonable but they do not describe fair use of current monetary system that is why they are reforms but they need no change existing monetary system proposals more targeted public investments better accountability eliminate fraudulent lending green economy fiscal targetting tax polluters invest sustainable firms digital cash are all fine have no issue them but where heck is guarantee of employment for anyone seeking positive money what is pm buffer stock sparkling mineral water but it does me no good eyes of positive money activist tell them these policies could already be implemented any way you look at it if votes parliament are there twill be done there is no need hinder those votes by also asking for other crankery monetary reforms that try turn money into something positive when money is always everywhere has been for over 5000 years record of credits debits do wonder if positive money people realize their system would still be tax-driven so their money would still be tax credit so their money would still be iou of state debt of state negative on treasury balance sheet or for you me overdraft oh dear integers bridging semantic gap there might be some semantics issues that can help overcome argy-bargies between mmt activists positive money activists could we first establish definition credit $-$debt money credit money is claim on real resources you can pass it on exchange someone who desires be credit then we can ask what positive money people think defines money their positive bank reserves facilitate payments but still bit of charade this might be hard gain agreement upon but banking software is where we can go see banks never lend their reserves \u0026mdash even if they think they do software wont let them failing inspecting software some countries like new zealand usa permit freedom of information act requests foia we could use few of those yah getting positive money activist on-board can take while brief there is no need for fractional reserve banking${}^\\s$ there is need for accurate accounting which is already performed so that only leaves need understand monetary system stop it from being abused it is being abused using unemployed buffer stock of human labour is human rights crime by any fair account of matter if not abused it does not need reform managers of system are ones needing reform if we do positive money reforms whats stop banking mafia from just getting government give them other ways screw over workers so lets focus on real issue which is proper just governance of existing monetary system it is fit for purpose people presently running governments are not but we can help educate them so they are or next generation at least this will likely shut down our current dougbot project requiring reboot since wed be new regime but will not be complaining ${}^\\s$ fractional reserve banking is artificial self-imposed constraint on credit also known as artificial austerity if positive money people have defence avoid needless austerity then why extra complication rules that requires resources enforce will admit am bit vague on why some of positive money people want fractional reserve banking be thing caveats steve keen defines credit as rate of change of debt this is believe highly non-standard usage terribly confusing he means of course on opposite sides of balance sheet or godley table entity $a$ has credit equals entity $b$ having rising debt not just debt hate this usage when bank debits account it always credits another by same amount no rate time is involved interest rate time span of credit factors time dimension you have return credit after some time but this case debt should also be flow too not stock if you want be consistent this would then conflict standard usages for government sector government deficit or surplus is flow government debt is accumulated deficit over all time stock mmt usage credit $=$ $-$debt $\\delta$credit $-\\delta$ debt rate of change of debt is deficit when positive is surplus =rate of change of net credit time period is usually taken as one year next post

particular stock prices or even sectors we are interested main aggregated market indices usa spx nasdaq whatever this is partly pragmatic if you liken economic system weather climate climate is very predictable highly macro weather is not too micro whenever you see such qualitative level distinctions you know you are dealing dynamical system so-called emergent properties top-down causations purely bottom-up system that admits reductionistic description can always be modelled using micro-casual analysis \u0026mdash enough compute power genuine top-down controlled system does not admit such analysis but most dynamical systems are not entirely top-down economy of large nation is such hybrid system it has micro-causal macro-causal responses feedbacks so also involves potential for useful mesoscopic analysis for philosophers genuine top-down causation is impossible classical physics so is considered impossible economics because economic system is considered not be sensitive quantum mechanics but this is incredibly naïve foolish there is stupid dumb way you can see it is foolish at very basic level because all computers running modern fintec systems nanosecond trading algorithms absolutely must rely upon quantum mechanics because their transistors cannot function otherwise but this is stupid because transistors are mere means classical end computation on traders desktop is turing machine process even sub-turing because it lacks infinite memory tape so all that is totally classical physics input into economic system so where is top-down economics you do not have believe roger penrose think quantum mechanics pays role human thinking processes but you should understand human consciousness is not explained by physics inner subjective phenomenal qualia so no matter what source of human consciousness is we do not really care for present purposes whatever it is it is not physics so human psychology is not driven by bottom-up blind physical events you will need read my other website t4g theory see one set of reasons why or just trust me human beings making good bad lame chad decisions are top-down influences on economics bottom-up signals as other inputs generalized forces one question one might naïvely ask is what are generalized forces economic system that move prices six billion dollar question most analysts give up use brute raw statistical probability theory analysis which is admitting you have no idea about forces you only know distributions of outcomes which think is fair approach even state-of-the-art dynamical systems models ann artificial neural networks thing is no dynamical system model can do better prediction or modelling job than accuracy of your modelling assumptions permits no ann can do better prediction or modelling job than data it gets trained on can admit this is because all real anns are finite state machines so they lack conscious thought so lack genuine creative insight capacity so cannot generate more than what information theory la shannon can be found their inputs this is all so unless you subscribe radical panpsychism anyhow this is big issue for our effort over at dougbot project because what argue douglas is that we are automating his canniness not creating new thinking being that can oracle stock prices pragmatic terms this does not really effect our research because research team needs push pull but for you philosophers of finance this might be of interest also if you are investor who has come across some wild good claims about how genius has found way beat markets earn you insane returns did someone just say carlo pietro giovanni guglielmo tebaldo ponzi rather than looking for oracle powers idea method for dougbot is use hybrid techniques simplest is use dynamical system model of steve keen goodwin-minsky variety get very high level macro dynamics correct dude portugal did this for portuguese economy pedro sousa you can get his phd paper here being eu this thesis not trivial bank flows had be carefully analysed sousa did excellent job such models are not going say squat about stock prices but they might have useful information for informing us about macro aggregates like s\u0026ampp500 or nasdaq or new zealand npx trouble is macroeconomic models deal fiscal flow or godley tables there is no real generalized force them for seeing how relative prices move because complexity available currently these minsky models there is only one price level or two if you are clever asset prices call them fictional goods can be partially de-coupled from goods prices real goods being physical things people consume not numbers on bits of paper all forces most of keen-minsky models can currently build are behavioural equations such as phillips curve rest is just stock-flow consistency mere accounting your nation does have have fair justice system have accounting rules satisfied reality though it is not trivial imagine rampant counterfeit imagine rampant bank fraud such deviant illegal behaviour would invalidate minksy-keen model unless we accounted for it \u0026mdash black market ops counterfeit rows godley tables for most part we hope be able ignore such factors here have conjecture get wild insane returns like one particular fund claims you need be dealing black market or something illegal drug dealers traffickers will be prepared make insane losses due nature of their business they can still eat caviar but their loss is someone elses gain so black ops hedge fund bet investor who is extremely diversified this leaves us generalized forces driving relative absolute price movements that will need be empirically determined that is hard task but some physics principles can help us how can you measure force if something is moving you can measure force by measuring acceleration we can do this for lot of fiscal flow data published by fred bis good early news is that we can see hints of causal relations from looking at accelerations lagged margin debt spx this is promising because although there is still lot of noise we can see generalized force acting problem is economic system has many people their feet on gas peddles brakes all over place we are looking at superposition of them all aggregate so it is always going be noisy conjecture our research is based upon is that some of this will be gaussian noise if it is then we are not dealing power law dynamics not fat tails signals this is vital for getting well-trained neural nets anns do not like noise it is best think of ann as merely canning your reasoning capacity when comatose or dead drunk it is going be feeble but you can make out numbers letters maybe stop versus go signs what if forces are static stress am not sure economics has this concept but consumer sentiment is possibly qualitative form of data we might be able use but at this stage it would be sketchy it is something stock brokers finance journalist use debt-to-gdp is stock divided by flow stocks are lot like static forces you can measure their velocity acceleration get flow variable but if you can also find force signal stock then that is acting like stress good example of this is major example great crash of 1929 gfc of 2007-8 both had private debt excess of 150% of gdp this stress variable its rate of change over 10% that velocity measure so rate of change of acceleration indicating underlying force both stress velocity seem be triggers neither separately this is from empirical work by richard vague see breif history of doom although if am right there should have been impulse triggered great crash that would be short burst accelerator if recall from reading galbraith great crash 1929 force mostly psychological boundless hope optimism 2007-8 force emergence of just few short traders they pushed subprime mortgage market off knife-edge balance of wild optimism real estate cdos mbss but it is always more complicated rumour gossip wild optimism yields neurosis \u0026ampc it is hard gauge these forces but time series accelerations forces produce are always visible should have more write about this coming months we are trying find dominant accelerators guess it is also worth mentioning wall street quants probably know accelerators they just do not make that knowledge public so we have do this work for our community of followers forces from ledger books godley tables explained here by ty keynes do not model generalized economic forces per se they model accounting rules flows are determined by behavioural equations that relate stock variables minsky-keen models for example phillips curve for wage rate as function of employment price level behavioral function here $ft$ $$ \\frac{dx_i}{dt} ft x_1 x_2 \\ldots $$ is like generalized force but if dependent variable $x_i$ here is not price then it is not so useful for dougbot price might however be sensitive $x_i$ which would be useful know also wed need $x_i$ itself be flow not stock that is because rate of change $dx dt$ is velocity not acceleration if $x_i$ stock then $ft$ would be velocity e.g how fast cash is turning over if we only look at velocities we would not have causal model get cause we need force forces are drivers velocities are effects of drivers stocks are lowest downstream effects where things end up after given time period need write caveat all this is largely metaphorical outside steve keens work no one really understands financial system force-like terms it is all energy-like \u0026mdash thermodynamic equilibrium \u0026mdash if you wanted physics analogy which is all wrong-headed neoclassical thinking btw reason steve keen says his minksy dynsys models prove mmt is because he says mmt is just accounting this is pretty awful of steve but he can be forgiven we mmt enthusiasts would say mmt is lot more than accounting it is about societies legal financial institutional arrangements much more than just accounting rules however part steve keen is right about use of godley tables because of these legal rules old days it used be ledger books money created by fountain pen youd have hard time back then doing real-time forecasting financial time series published these days amateur computer programmer can probably see near real time velocities accelerators financial data interest rate repeller other social forces there is of course lot more mmt analysis its implications for system dynamics stock prices move by one type of set of forces but wages by others often activists are more interested wage consumer price goods price movements could give fig about stock price movements these cannot all be completely de-coupled because of fiscal constraints embedded banking system government has freedom set absolute price level what appears keen-goodwin-minsky model but not all relative prices unless they are totalitarian government which we have never really perfectly seen on earth just approximations one reason steve keen tarnishes his reputation by abusing mmt community as nothing but accountants is because it matters politically whether people understand mmt system use it wisely that has been point of mmt social movement for over 30 years as of date from founding by warren mosler bill mitchell randall wray joined by stephanie kelton pavlina tcherneva matt forstadter scott fulwiler now legions of others particular what steve keen has never acknowledged correctly afaik is insight of bill mitchell on buffer stocks that mmt system which is currently operational reality most nations world uses labour buffer this is vital mmt understanding without it you get idiots like steve keen can say this since he is good internet friend aussie so he knows am just blowing hot air but only half-joking claiming mmt is nothing but accounting say steve that labour buffer is not accounting it is matter of grave social justice or injustice depending on how people understand buffer also think steve keen is very old school on treasury bonds story warren mosler had insight no one else agreed him at time that when fed sells treasury bonds for monetary operations it functionally same as treasury selling bonds for fiscal operations he realized you cannot call them different functions still this day most post-keynesians disagree this is not mere accounting squabble people agree about software operations think it is government function insight fed cannot be thought of as private entity independent of us government if you still think otherwise you are not mmt aware thing is it makes huge difference political economy so is far far beyond impact of just accounting it can ruin peoples lives always those who lives are already most miserable by pushing austerity politics using interest rate repeller among other injustices would also claim that warren mosler best understood impact of moving floating exchange rate fiscal space this freed up for government post-keynesians generally not all still do not comprehend this steve keen seems still be one of them most post-keynesian think exchange rate is exogenous constraint mmt says it is not not if you understand correct actual software-driven legally instituted monetary operations available governments but this includes legal let me say it again legal arrangements mmt says these matter over above accounting principles this is vital for understanding why no fit currency issuing government has any foreign exchange constraint they do if they make up one only mosler 1995 understood this most post-keynesians still do not hence we have stupid debates about trade policy exports as cost imports as benefit mmt story which is correct exports are price you pay for your imports this is not neoclassical thinking as steve keen slurs mmt community it is just logic but logic can cause suffering for poorer nations if people do not understand it like logic of what happens when you ignore momentum walk into street lamp poles lastly for today will mention two key conditional fundamentals that post-keynesians do not seem understand or know deposit holders know crap all about their bank so liability side of banking is not place for market discipline central bank policy levers are about prices interest rates not quantities why are these conditional fundamentals it is because they apply when nation uses tax credit which is non-convertible currency on floating exchange rate without those conditions central bank has employ methods like bond issuance control interest rates control weakly exchange rates they furthermore will want deliberately cause mass unemployment limit inflation like psychopaths who have broad public approval for their ax murdering floating exchange rates there is no need for those functions above two fundamentals apply on fundamental mosler writes even wall street analysts cant reliably do this assess bank insolvency risk also thought it worth quoting rest of warrens paragraph on banking proposals for helping smaller banks regulation supervision on asset side then became imperative while we have seen periodic failures due lax regulation supervision of asset side of us banking system its work progress alternative of using liability side of banking for market discipline exposes real economy far more disruptions far more destructive systemic risk you cannot get more mmt than this if you do not understand monetary operations you will introduce instability inequality what ticked me off about steves flippant comments that it is not only warren who has been preaching truth for years steve keens acquaintance charles goodhart has too as warren relates fairly blisteringly true might add those who understand reserve accounting monetary operations including those directly involved monetary operations at worlds central banks have known for decades that banking causation runs from loans deposits reserve requirements if any being merely \u0026lsquoresidual overdraft at central bank not control variable this includes professor charles goodhart at bank of england who has written extensively on this subject for roughly half century endlessly debating \u0026lsquomonetarist academic economists who spew gold standard fixed exchange rate rhetoric who are unaware of how monetary operations are altered when there is no legal convertibility of currency once steve acknowledges all this other generalized forces mmt social movement he will apologise us he is good guy mean really good nice guy salt of earth bit of fire cracker his hand too though also am pretty sure he is trolling us when he says mmt is just accounting so took bait also he said that at mmt conference so of course he having aussie lark but he can also be damaging mmt movement when he says such things more publicly because they are wrong this matters because steve is very influential economist activist note self need write theory section on trade when we write about trade important thing is not be too simplistic naïve word seem need use lot fadhel kaboub jan kregel are mmt aware have decent body of work on international trade exchange rate is not their problem biggest problems by far are imperial power abuses neocolonialism just broadly war injustice dysfunctional justice systems weaker nations fixing up their exchange rate is pretty much negligible help all that but they need mmt lens know what do about it when they restore civil society australia will never have foreign exchange constraint because their government know how tell foreign buyers of their land politicians piss off \u0026mdash at least if they want too if they do not want well then their civilized bbqs shrimp could turn into charcoaled gruel purchased at tesco lotus shop even more generally we are dougbot project using mmt understanding lens do finer grain price analysis it is not merely accounting although we could call it post-keynesian or institutionalist mmt is superset of these schools not subset anyone thinking otherwise is just being very nasty founders of movement like mosler mitchell randall wray is better arbiter since he post-keynesian still is he considers himself now mmt thought not

commenting on highlights from perry mehrlings mooc on money banking online from inet today its comment on when mehrling starts out by alerting his students that he is going talk about ecb as if it private entity then only later lectures talk about money as creation of state thought this is completely wrong emphasis euro is mmt system but very weirdly structured so as look function like private or endogenous currency system but that is one of veils of money it is easy make state currency system mmt look like private currency just listen all lunatics who claim us fed is private bank they obviously all believe us dollar is created by fed not by congress they are complete nutters but it is easy forgive them because congress also acts like fed is hands-off private entity so it is little unfair blame nutters for their warped views those power controlling usa mmt system share lot of those warped views what is weird here is that usa at least some of eu nutters also tend hate government yet are following government narrative however this weirdness can be explained those same nutters are often ones getting elected into government yeah people who hate government are running governments why not from their perspective best way destroy something truly well is often from inside this is why we gotta stop electing them if enough people playing baseball game think it is cricket what you will observe is cricket game played catching mitts awkwardly rounded bats you see duality what does not change are field mitts ball bats but what is weird is how people use that equipment result is terrible game of cricket or worse game of baseball one of those is analogous usa other eu perhaps am not sure which is more appropriate mapping but how is mehrling any different nutters think mehrling understands basics of mmt but if you do then think moral obligation is talk about true account of currency monopoly first which means state theory of money has go first because it is primary pedagogically order matters aside you can tell bad teachers from good ones by order which they teach topics ive had this physics best way teach quantum mechanics is tell truth first before mathematical formalism which is that we have no clue what ontological basis for quantum mechanics is so everything follow is pure descriptive formalism wavefunction is not ontology so dont try construct ontology based on properties of wavefunction even better physics teacher might add although we do not think wavefunction is ontology it could be ontology point is we do not know so do not second guess nature it is ok conjecture ontology then test it however ecb certainly does function lot like private currency endogenous money system but that is only because that is way governments seem wish it be here by governments we really mean those power those power europe are wannabe oligarchs so yeah they are highly prone abusing state currency system treating it like private currency system this is major source of mess euroland hierarchy of money here is relvant bit from lecture on this commented all well good treat ecb as bankers bank if indeed that is what it is but it is not it is creation of eu so is creation of governments problem being that is plural so only more powerful members of eu germany france belgium really have what is akin monopoly currency issuing capacity contrast usa where congress has all monopoly since they can fire fed board vote nuance that should be put up-front is that these governments are de facto owned by bankers oligarchs through distortion of democracy so legalistically mehrling is wrong claim central banks are private institutions but functionally he is kind of right but only because demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively want be beholden private oligarch interests most neolib politicians aspire be members of oligarchy ok but fact monetary system gets abused several ways makes mehrlings point about hierarchy of financial instruments reality seriously big f-ing problem for social stability we need like things production equivalences remain rough equivalences as trade parity principles predatory financial speculators merchants of financial ponzi schemes tariffs other banking corruptions mess this up one nations tariffs become anothers subsidies you cannot expect people who get squeezed by unfair prices not fight back if they are lucky their government will fight back for them guess be fair mehrling if aim is learn how think like central banker then he has fair point leading ecb as bankers bank what am saying is why would any student want learn how think like central banker first first is bias so first you want students think like expertly informed workers who understand mmt system understand abuse of it then later it is fine teach them how central bankers view system why central bankers are wrong credit is not money about minutes into lecture segment mehrling seems take pains claim money is not credit here he is just plain wrong at least language framing he starts one view of his hierarchy of money gold is ultimate money which is cringe gold has never been money gold standard is not regime where gold is money it is regime where temporarily as long as trust gold supply lasts government or other currency issuer promises redeem for gold when gold runs out or is known be running out they always get off gold standard until some later time when gold reserves are grabbed back it is charade no one ever uses gold for purchasing it is just place-holder just like grain weights of wheat corn or barley used ancient times they are just placeholders for currency unit people who are not fetishists do not want or need gold they want credits they need eat so they want bread not gold metal form of currency is irrelevant all money is i.o.u of issuer so all money is someones credit whoever receives iou all money is equally someones debt debt of issuer but you might think am being pedantic it almost too cringe listen rest of this lecture segment mehrling claims money is how credit is repaid true but that just means money is credit because single currency system all credits debits are same units it is all same money form what mehrling is getting at is subtler point which is that when you have positive digits your bank account or coins or notes your pocket then these are unique ious because they are only ious on earth that you can redeem for tax liability extinction that is why state money seems different bank credit but if they are denominated same units then there is no difference both forms are tax credits operationally legally difference is process of how you get them into your bank account or wallet but when government says by fiat that their tax credit redeems for gold they are not thereby making gold money they are making gold buffer stock do not think mehrling understands this but it is critical thing understand what else mehrling really means is that commercial bank credit endogenous money is not same as state currency exogenous money this is agreement mmt agreement all legal operational reality most nations outside those who use foreign currency as their tax credits difference of course is stark so am not being pedantic there are painful realities taking on bank debt you get credit initially along signing explicit or one-time credit card agreement repay then you spend or why else use credit card so your credit gets moved into someone elses bank account they are now credit bank you are debt equally at least until interest charges accrue but when interest charges accrue bank gains more credit upon you you gain more debt dollar for dollar so sure enough endogenously all credit is debt however it holds exogenous as well but entirely different way profoundly different consequences this is mmt account of state currency state issues their currency by fiat not by credit you do not really need pay it back however someone has pay some fraction of it back due imposed tax liabilities but these are generalized arrangements can be arranged so that poorest people need pay no tax return that is difference whether you are poor or rich if you receive bank debt you must repay or lose your house or file for bankruptcy but if you receive government currency you do not have repay \u0026mdash so for instance if you are unfortunately poor then someone else will have pay some fraction of states currency back state need repay governments currency is thus not because receiver public sector worker or welfare beneficiary or contractor has taken upon debt burden fact it is opposite government has debt burden it is only society as whole that has tax liability burden that is by design so that principle operation of fiat currency can work without poorest shouldering burden since taxation is what drives demand for state currency someone has have tax liability imposed upon them so more justly that should be those who accumulate most by failing spend circulate their income they aught bear most of tax return burden \u0026mdash if we have well designed system but once bank credit goes into someone elses wallet they cannot distinguish it from government currency because it is same unit kilogram is kilogram whether it is chicken being weighed or brick it is only macroeconomically that distinction between issuing operations gets fully noticed ratio of private debt government issue or ratio of private debt gdp if private debt is too much higher than government fiat issue is growing faster then we have severe recessionary bias totally needlessly also \u0026mdash maybe this is something mehrling gets wrong later on am not yet sure \u0026mdash bank credit money is only as demand as government fiat currency since government licences banks bank money any creditors is equivalent government issue since this currency unit is same unit when say as demand as mean generally macro obviously people would prefer being given currency for selling goods or their labour time rather than having take bank credit themselves so it is not bank credit that is just as much demand it is currency freely floating that is demand once you get tax credit you dont care where it came from unless you are macroeconomist that is then you do care steve keens minksy models show you why you should care bank credit sources produce instability government issue does not however when chap like mehrling comes along says credit is not money he muddies waters it might even be poisoning well because if you see money as standalone thing that is no other entitys obligation or debt then you are both crazy privileging people who can mine that stuff out of ground or on computer or pirate stuff partly this is semantics but society semantics are incredibly important if we all have common misunderstanding that money equals some scarce stuff that everyone just agrees can settle payments then you are down cryptocurrency dead-end road allowing all sorts of scams frauds whereas if you take mmt semantics that all money is iou of issuer \u0026mdash promise redeem \u0026mdash then you have at least possibility of just society payments layer possibility because justice still needs be fought for protected mmt is only intellectual weapon that on-going spiritual war or jihad why say semantics matters is because it makes difference you can easily pirate gold or crytocurrency latter is called cracking not hacking or software back-door but you cannot pirate records on secured public ledger at least not very easily you have own ledger private bank deposit accounts are extremely secure most nations extent they are insecure they become pirate-able people are tight-assed about their bank accounts will soon let police or serious fraud office know if their account gets tampered extent bankers are at bare minimum trusted at least not fiddle too much numbers your bank account then banking system prevents piracy history shows empirically it works it just works except when thieves own banks 2008 gfc style read william blacks book \u0026#39the best way rob bank is own one\u0026#39 but even lead-up 2008 gfc no bankers fiddling numbers your bank account they do not need they need fiddle numbers their own bank account mark them ones up my dudes admit this matters if done on large scale because ratio of bank account numbers is what matters for social equity justice if million bankers can just mark-up their accounts by ten times that of everyone else using keyboard they gain relatively more purchasing power regardless of what stuff you think money happens be fool it is social consequences of which issuer you get currency from that matters it is better get it as creditor work for government or sell someone rather than as debtor you ideally at macro level want government be principle debtor because they cannot run out of their won currency this is thinking behind positive money movement which unfortunately also suffers from insanity so should write about that some time next post capitalism reality previous post veils of money back blog

some theoretical philosophical some practical real started writing this essay after friend douglas mmt trader suggested listen perry mehrlings lectures on money banking which cover as reading material collected works of allyn young after only short browse through mehrlings book on collected works of allyn young discovered few interesting things related mmt that thought worth blogging about wanted write them down before finishing lectures book see if get my mind changed which is always aim of all my study exciting when it happens am going write ahistorically here because do not yet know all of allyn youngs work so me he is fictional character that am using as avatar write about role of money macroeconomic system money growth one of major themes of allyn youngs thought his contribution economics professions understanding of how monetary systems are not mere veil over barter that rather monetary operations institutions are critical for helping hindering real economic growth prosperity so far this aligns mmt thought but young also seemed implicitly understand that money forms not truly crucial thing that performance of monetary system only means end that end being fair just distribution of real output settlement of obligations other words this seems align somewhat neoclassical economics money is veil over barter story but only if by barter we generalize any trade goods or social currency of debts feuds other obligations which think helps make it crystal clear neoclassical \u0026lsquoadam smith barter story is both incomplete reactionary \u0026mdash because it either implies money is only about barter goods or generalized sense it implies people who have money are \u0026lsquosocial credit hence have rightfully by divine decree earned their position as if theft exploitation corruption piracy prevented by divine decree of invisible hand proper nuance is that mmt is correct neoclassicals are wrong way allyn young would have arrived at this conclusion is because he seemed understand imposition of two opposing social forces that monetary operations are crucial friction that if abused by rich powerful can be severe obstacles justice that money form itself can function far better than veil over barter because it can facilitate trade commerce clear implication is that role of currency monopolist is minimize maximize that is government should not that they do just that they should play role monetary economy by suppressing abuse of money form by most powerful facilitate trade so that money does become more of mere veil mmt think would agree by mmt would think mean all mmt aware scholars activists mmt system itself does not think so can not agree nor disagree anything but you see tension mmt emphasises role of money banking way that steve keen\u0026#39s goodwin-minsky models vividly describe dynamically against almost all neoclassical myths but realm of political economy mmt de-emphasises importance of holding currency unit when only when it comes government policy considerations when you are issuer of currency you do not need worry about running out of money you neither have money nor do not have money because you issuer money is unit of your system of accounts that is because currency is not physical thing not commodity it is system of records of credits debts state currency form is tax credit tax credit is idea system is idea each have physical manifestations but physical tokens forms are almost irrelevant \u0026mdash recall island tribe yap islanders who used huge stone boulders some of which remained sunk sea as their tokens private money forms are different they are not tax credits but they are still i.o.us of their issuers commonality shared by all forms of money is that they are records of credit debt other words i.o.us of their issuer also common is what currency issuers mostly worry about which is how drive demand for their otherwise worthless i.o.us naïve naturalists anarchists austrian schoolers neoclassicals do not want grapple this problem they try wish it away like tooth fairy but it is only major problem wannabe currency issuer faces warren mosler wrote about how this fundamental problem is solved 7dif first using case of family parents issue their i.o.u children redeem it for extra playtime or whatever earn parents credits by doing household chores our relation governments is very similar abstract sense of course lesson is that demand for money is driven some way by powerful force parents family government nation king kingdom who commands loyal army priests running temple authority community or council running commune allyn young had somewhat naïve understanding of these facts probably related overly biased view about what constitutes justified private property rights so like lot of economists who came out of anti-marxist classical schools he tends shy away from recognizing role of governments as currency monopolists curiously though most marxists also shy away from recognizing government as currency monopolist for opposite ideological reasons guess being on opposite sides of class war can make people equally delusional sad thing about that last parenthetical remark is that neither marxists nor anti-marxists need believe myth that money is private creation of banks it helps both their cases if they recognize mmt reality you will not win class war by relying upon myth because other side will always grab advantage by abandoning myth going reality-based war misunderstanding energy this is just side note but important one it perhaps concerns one other veil of money but am not sure can justify it just yet as due money veil but will be giving this some later thought one problem allyn young had can be found one of legacies of his work which is endogenous growth theory this idea mainstream economics is that growth of economy by implication prosperity is mainly determined by factors operating within economy is not overly dependent upon external factors this is laughable theory it is one of great embarrassments economics that so many economists take it seriously but we can understand easily why if we think all energy is free then for sure economy can operate fairly fine endogenously but as physiocrats quesnay today kate raworth steve keen many other ecological economists understand role of energy production cannot be ignored no economic system gets energy endogenously most of it comes from sun that is ricardo-smith-marx tradition of thinking of either land or labour as only source of surplus value is utterly bone-headed wrong caveat this is that if you are able factor out energy your models some way perhaps as one unique external factor then maybe you can do ok macroeconomic analysis using endogenous growth theory ideas but there is no way pure endogenous growth theory works it is joke furthermore youngs supposed big idea that contra-quesnay contra-smith contra-marx it is not land or labour that is source of value but rather trade so young as naïve as all rest albeit little more original youngs thesis on trade being real source of wealth is shall we say interesting it is nuanced position but trade is not possible without energy so physiocrats are still foundation of economics higher layers of analysis just ignore this never had worry until today when energy demands are out-stripping biospheres regenerative capacity meaning no trade is going help this apply youngs thinking however is not fruitless because trade intellectual ideas is what will ultimately avoid ecological catastrophe so am prepared give allyn young his due on getting something good thought-out that went more than little bit beyond mainstream economic narrow-minded thought could come back this later identify this as fifth veil of money \u0026mdash idea that money is so dominant commerce that sales drive profits is so critical capitalism that role of energy as one common dominant factor all production of any kind from socialist capitalist feudalist gets utterly ignored or is it better say taken for granted so much that it is invisible invisible perhaps all but oil cartels electricity suppliers this last point \u0026mdash that energy is well understood be kingpin commodity that rules them all \u0026mdash is so well understood it is perhaps taken for granted except during energy cartel price gouging event but because it is so well understood as dominant driver of global currency inflation events when no currency is safe unless their governments comprehend mmt${}^\\ast$ think academic economists ignore role of energy production focus excessively on price instead think this is big blind spot of mainstream economics ${}^\\ast$mmt has perhaps only proper understanding of how foreign nation can combat oil monopoly price fixing which is let inflation run until energy cartels give up any government running fiat currency can always re-gauge their currency get oil meantime invest substitutes this is relative price adjustment story not hyperinflation story unless governments make it inflation bogeyman story by buying oil they suffer pass-through inflation but thats irrelevant maintaining fair domestic distribution because that government just raises their minimum wage welfare support number of zeroes they add on their lowest denomination currency bills is just digits of information no gold is at stake no grandchildren will ever be held ransom all that matters is relative price not absolute value stamped on currency or bank accounts what then matters is how much work your nation needs do export goods pay for oil imports that is always relative value story not runaway inflation story what also matters is psychological pressures coming from inflation fear-mongering which is real problem that mmt cannot directly help you except inform you problem is only peoples imaginations${}^{\\dagger}$ which is not trivial help margaret thatcher had exactly this psychological problem when she complained price of milk twice that when she child somehow she did not comprehend wages had gone up more than double all without putting any gold or crown jewels at stake ${}^{\\dagger}$i think it is fair say only mmt people understand this however this is no inoculation against getting sh*t scared that saying this truth out loud can earn ridicule condemnation truth is not always easy tell can put proverbial fear of god into those who dare speak it used not be too much of problem when human energy use easily well within planetary ecosystem boundaries but today that is no longer case so modern economists post 1980 or thereabouts are morally obligated update all their models account for crucial role of energy production especially at macroeconomic level where up until today it has been almost totally ignored this wise do not fault allyn young since he writing time when planetary ecological stress boundaries not understood seemed invisible anyway am not going call blindness role of energy production one of veils of money but hushed whispers think it really is one of veils of money so would be fifth on my list only reason for whispering here is that am not exactly sure of true historical story of how energy got ignored if engineers physicists had been first economists not philosophers of politics morality then think energy would always have been critical economics but that just not way history unfolded first veil am not going say all this is some sort of metaphysical characterisation of various veils im just free-flow writing here this veil is first one pop out veil is way money is so heavily used commercial trade that true origins history gets obscured dominant use of money is thus veil over true history origins origins of money are well understood by archeologists anthropologists knapp mitchell-innes graeber hudson wray among others true history is that forms of temple emperor or state authority currency all arose from settlement of debts thus records of credit every debt had corresponding credit for sure double entry book-keeping much later invention but before book-keeping people held these records of obligations well enough their heads any record of such debt or credit is form of money highly abstract sense i.o.u material sense monetary units properly came into existence when grain weights of rice or barley or wheat used as artifice or stand-in for those records of course paper records that reliable could have been used before solving forgery problem of paper records discovered tally sticks pretty good currency records note that none of this implies currency unit always creation of government state which is narrow chartalism sometimes means of settlement of debts so currency as means of payment can be created outside of government perhaps by feudal lord oligarch religious temple or some other power or authority or collective mmt story of money is still chartalist but is generalized chartalism \u0026mdash which means it almost always practically takes some power or authority run currency unit payments system they have be either trusted feared or both on this topic margaret atwoods accounts payback debt shadow side of wealth give vivid history that would make any zeitgeist movement philes wet their pants zeitgeist movement folks are not all bad though their motives are all good helping hindering this duality mmt exists any institutionally arranged system it is almost tautology because unless something is deterministic machine designed built function perfectly then system it runs will have imperfections some may help bias outcomes good way some bad way for example some of us joke that dick cheney most accomplished mmt policy maker past 25 years mostly for bad john maynard keynes galbraith most accomplished mmt policy makers during world war ii galbraith post-war era mostly for good at least by account their sides won war extent that success had anything do moving private production into public sector for that period successful war time efforts are examples of where there is one type of veil of money partially lifted everyone works for war effort issuing enough currency is not even debated issuer always finds enough currency they do so either by suspending artifice of gold standard or they just implement pure fiat money operations without gold standard veil forever after gold standard is thus revealed by wars be veil there never really gold money currency is always tax credit issuer tells you what it is worth if they tell you it redeems for $\\pi 100$ ounces of gold then thats fiat price what it can purchase then depends upon relative price of gold other goods but who gets that purchasing power is still choice of currency issuer like control of nuclear power primitive fire powerful force or technology can always be used commit atrocities mmt is no exception but monetary system is ancient has existed for over 5000 years is often force for good when used wisely it is not free market or natural equilibrium that achieves good or terrible social outcomes it is our wilful design or negligence that another near tautology if pure free market ever exist it would be by human conscious willful design my thought on that is always that what most people desire is fair market not free market freedom implies all sorts of bad things through fallacies of composition everyone is free stand up seats at football game or opera but they dont they constrain themselves for \u0026lsquogreater good greater good hence constraint is really more freedom not less because we are now talking about different qualities of freedom all freedoms are not equal quality freedom absolutists are knuckleheads use technical term people will bitch moan at us yeah but who gets say what counts as quality freedom ideal answer is always demos current realpolitk answer is oligarchs point is it is encumbent upon collective demos crack realpolitik corral governments towards ideal do so by claiming back their government from oligarchs oligarchs do have ownership claims on todays governments but that is unjust claim all people must act destroy that illegitimate claim understanding mmt gives people clear understanding how \u0026mdash oligarchs do not control monetary system government does demos must therefore reclaim their government it does not rightfully belong oligarchs second veil second veil is gold standard idea that because you need some token make payment token or stuff it is made out of itself is somehow money as explained above gold standard does not make gold currency it makes gold buffer stock if issuer runs out of gold currency rapidly deflates since buffer stock becomes scarce it is insane unstable system all mainstream economists agree mmt that sustained moderate inflation is better than any deflation but especially better than bursts of deflation bank runs cross of gold artificial austerity all that third veil third veil of money is way idea occurs unthinking people that \u0026lsquohaving money is seen as prestige by default almost taken as implying person lots of money has earned it so is \u0026lsquogood person or has been \u0026lsquohard working sometimes this is true veils are like that they will often reveal true silhouette money as this veil obscures corruption greed obscures fact poorest people are not deserving of being poor only mmt recognizes why this is true because mmt understands source of all unemployment monetary economy \u0026mdash that source is not laziness or apathy mmt this fashion follows tradition of edwards deming who pointed out japanese management or any management experts who would listen that they should not punish lowest performing workers because no matter how perfect their production system all workers top notch talents there is always lowest performer be found being lowest performer given period thus means next nothing it is incontrovertible statistic system as whole has be judged not trivially existing least productive worker deming said that if you have poor performing worker who should on paper be ok worker something is more likely wrong system money institutions at governmental level only at governmental level mmt tells us our already existing monetary legal institutions make state currency units mere scorepoints \u0026mdash as far as government is concerned \u0026mdash so government policy maker their unit of account state currency but only their states currency is mere veil over business of banking commerce regulation but this is absolutely critical awareness too many people on both political left right fail see this dual aspect money specifically state currency not private money forms caricature political divides somewhat id say lefties see money as evil some sense but focus on power of money how this is unfairly distributed they fail recognise full mmt picture because they do not see that governments control state currency system so are not beholden collecting taxes off rich people there are many other ways governments can ensure that there is no undue wealth inequality society e.g prevent unbridled capital accumulation first place right-wingers see money as essential but only as veil over barter because they cannot bring themselves see any essential role for government private commerce they fail recognize full mmt picture because they do not understand what drives monetary numeraire on right-wingers for second we know that what drives demand for fiat currency is imposition of liabilities of some kind or another it has never been any other way throughout all history fact one pretty good definition of money is that money is i.o.u \u0026mdash promise of issuer redeem that is equivalent record of credit debt issuer is debt receiver credit when receiver of i.o.u returns it issuer debt is redeemed creditor is back zero credit right-wingers fail understand all past present monetary systems because they cannot wrap their heads around this definition of money most right-wingers money is some physical substance like gold so they hate this concept of fiat currency which is nothing but scorepoints on secured ledger books one can go ahead use concept of physical stuff like gold as money but then you have re-wire all your macroeconomic models my knowledge no one has ever successfully done this more critically practice no nation has ever implemented such commodity money system though many right-wingers seem think those systems have existed eras of feudal rule when empires had broken down it is true that at some times gold coins or other metals used as socially understood commodity currency but problem is that this relied upon mass social misconception metal coins always traded for goods according numeraire stamped on coins this never held equal trade value of actual metal which normally lot less than numeraire face value on coins \u0026mdash because otherwise people would quickly learn melt down coins often illegally sell them actually writing it that way am not sure if it is correct call it mass social misconception people living at time had understand system since they did not go around melting down metal coins yet there misconception at some point because most accounts eventually tell story that metal currency so digging it up out of ground or mining it banking often allow other philosophers activists have their own definitions so if right-winger comes along insists money is commodity like gold would normally if this mapped science problem let it go but we cannot let it go when it comes macroeconomics because it makes huge f-ing difference whether or not state currency units we get tax liabilities imposed upon us are real stuff or mere scorepoints you want it be scorepoints why because you do not want motivate pirates because you want regulator of this system be able actually implement some justice balance economy so that increasing returns wealth do not become automatic destabiliser because you want inequality wealth holdings be surmountable because you want way eliminate nominal poverty so you do not want their scorepoints be artificially limited imagine at football game your side scores try or touchdown win at final second scorekeeper sorry lads ive run out of points minute ago this is all critical for justice even right-wingers like justice so they aught want fiat currency system points on government scoreboard but sometimes there is just no getting through reactionary minds of conservatives who seem simply be genetically ill-disposed all forms of government encroachment upon private markets this is highly ironic because market goods for sale semblance of democratic state currency system does not exist without government force tax collector imposing return of liabilities trouble for right-wingers libertarians is that if state government does not exist you only get something worse which is landlord imposing their own private liabilities upon you give me half your grain sheep or ill burn your hut down fourth veil because money is seen as instrument of most powerful because having excess credit gives someone more purchasing power this store-of-value function of state currency is veil over proper role of ideal democratic state it is because people hate see leviathan exerting power over little people that big government big brother is seen as anathema this is however veil over reality that without government little people aka working class are even more entirely screwed it is better have monopoly currency issuer protecting working class than have peasants real workers fend for themselves some libertarian anarcho-capitalist fantasy world problem is our governments have never been protectors of working class all gains made by working class have been by collectivist approaches exerting influence upon governments at chagrin of people running government government is crucial institution for worker emancipation but workers cannot just sit back wait for their rights be granted human rights have be exerted have be fought for have be won on moral grounds well before they are won on material grounds way warren mosler has put this is that labour market is not fair game role of democratic government is balance that playing field workers need more protection than bosses when people adopt view that money should be private system they are placing this veil over rightful role of democratic government conclude think there are other veils of money but ill stop at these for now think they are most important veils understand next post money banking euroland previous post neural nets mmt back blog

trader we hope be publishing research on use of convolutional neural net lstm algorithms for predicting forward returns on spx macro finance am doing this further mmt education research relevant very macro stock market index fund data idea is that even though finance bros hate mmt they cannot ignore mmt if knowledge of relevance of fiscal flows sectoral balances gives them superior prediction algorithm while no algorithms success as predictor is proof theory behind algorithm is true it is necessary condition for theory be true necessary but not sufficient douglas are happy for now show you few necessary conditions for mmt are true frustration this is still frustrating because macroeconomic level is where mmt makes its claims claims are good easy verify stock-flow consistency monetary operations accurately described central bank-treasury relations their relations private banks legal reality checked out source of unemployment source of price level mmt ticks all those boxes thing is any fair minded economist can verify mmt is correct on these accounts but then there is no other need for checking mmt mmt does not make any claims about how bosses treat workers how steel gets produced how modern farms work how corrupt billionaires are how they turn corrupt governments so on so forth same goes for trading mmt cannot tell traders what they are doing partly because traders dont have clue about mmt they are unhinged from reality of state currency monetary operations their mental model is basically neoclassical barter this means there is still work that can be done on getting finance community on-board mmt once you get on board you never get off it is important because deep knowledge of mmt lot of injustices get revealed which finance bros currently completely ignore probably help perpetuate fake need for some people be debt banks microfinance it is not so easy develop microfinance predictors using mmt however economics is funny sort of system it is engineered run by human beings economics macro very often impinges upon micro ways that say neoclassical or austrian school economists simply could not comprehend finance bros from those schools tend be oh but we are all about bottom-up which is fine for what it can get you but when dynamical system has strong top-down causation such as existence of monopolists single-suppliers single buyers bottom-up analysis is going miss lot predictors are not going be as good as those that are appropriately informed by macro analysis at present we do not know what macroeconomic mmt analysis can do for improving microeconomic predictors so this is not our active focus of research but it is fascinating area think about developing let us know if you think you have insight into how get such research going we suspect machine learning models neural nets particular will be good tools for doing first level analysis just see what causal relations might probabilistically be \u0026mdash between macro micro so research paradigm would be use anns initially just figure out relations not predict anything at first just sort out how macroeconomic flows feed into various sectors at level of firms households so still partially macroscopic units this would be more properly termed mesoeconomic analysis contributions if you think such research sounds exciting please help us you can contribute almost anything realms of code ideas or funding if you can help fund our research we will give back for ko-fi donations am achrononmaster ko-fi join douglas mmt macro trader who knows lot more about
