[{"content":"last post wrote about way euroland is ponzi which came from warren mosler at mmt fiscal sustainability conference 2010 but that also led me bill mitchell\u0026#39s incredibly powerful statements on massive costs of unemployment latter is what want focus more on today think its single most important topic macroeconomics second only political economy issue of lasting world peace output gap output gap is defined as difference between real gdp produced given year potential maximum gdp that could have been produced had all available resources been fully employed notice problem that definition it implies slavery of some description so wed better fix it we do not really want estimate maximum potential gdp but rather optimal level of gdp from full resource employment now what does that mean well there are at least two problems maximisation as compared optimization maybe more than two we do not want nominal gdp be measure it has be real gdp that also means we should want count only non-bullsh*t jobs human well-being should also be optimized which is not factored any way nipa accounting so we cannot just maximise output since that will entail some sort of wage slavery at very least we do not want optimal gdp include any wage slavery coercive or brutal work conditions on point if useless products are sold that gets counted as real gdp not doing nipa accounts justice we do want count all sh*t jobs those are necessary jobs someone has do which are generally considered unpleasant bullsh*t jobs as identified by david graeber may or may not be pleasant work conditions but are typically associated spiritual violence hate my job are jobs understood usually by worker be unnecessary for decent human civilization on point because human well-being is subjective it is hard quantify optimal potential gdp we really should use some other metrics but failing that we can do keynes for now take recent past as best guide present although thats going be conservative regressive it could also be considered fair baseline because greater well-being of workers usually more productive less bullsh*t work so reactionary conservative posture recent past will likely under-estimate output gap that is ok for our purposes because all we need show is that estimated conservative output gap is still horrific waste of human lives veritable crime against humanity or should be thought of as so investors are not blame lets first distinguish between investors people buying stocks or shares productive firms from more finance rentier types people speculating purely financial assets derivatives \u0026mdash as mosler puts it total waste of human endeavour real investors are people marginal savings money they do not need so seek put it work for some return on their investment did not keynes say that drain on economy rentiers savers \u0026mdash people not spending all their income so true if everyone spent all their income it would drive up supply i.e output lead us close full employment if not full non-bullsht job employment realize non-bullsht is doing lot of work here it basically is way of capturing microeconomics but speaking at macro level so bit dodgy nevertheless tragedy of our times is firms do not like hire long term unemployed yet deliberate neoliberal policy generates long term unemployment by design due their nairu myth so we have problem even if everyone tried spend all their income it is unlikely firms will hire all workers so wed still have small output gap however point make today is that we are nowhere near full employment have not been near full employment any major industrialized country since 1960s when neoliberalism roughly started take hold monetarists become grossly ascendant austerity belt-tightening became foolish order of day which innocent public swallowed like bitter medicine which is how pr firms fraudulently sold neoliberalism or like lambs slaughter worse than that if you just look at employment numbers you are failing count all truly bullsh*t jobs those are also massive opportunity costs severe costs social costs of unemployment better mmters list these here will steal few from wray from pavlina tcherneva regardless of massive output gap costs never be recovered these social costs are truly horrific even complete economic nerd can appreciate cost society treat depression all other pathologies

which has interesting back-story found lot of gems id forgotten bill mitchell is hilarious good way it one of moslers though that got me thinking at one point warren says eurozone member nations are effectively ponzi position thats using particular definition of ponzi which this case having get money from someone else so how is that problem its ponzi because apart from germans who could continue net exporting getting euro from someone else none of others can maybe netherlands net export any case they cannot all be net exporters or more exactly cannot all have positive current account euros they could all be net exporters outside eurozone but theyre not any case that is not robust way guarantee non-ponzi such is emu arrangement that more aggressive internal within-euroland net exporters euro can effectively force another eurozone member into such severe current account deficit euro that latter runs past stability nongrowth pact deficit limit meaning harsh penalties get imposed needlessly should they put sgp back place post-covid post-ukraine put lazy greeks out of work because theyre not working hard enough moral hazard when warren expands upon point he made about eu he talks of problem terms of moral hazard this context it is dynamic that can be set up when monetary union like australia or usa or eu is split into competing states if states are then not fiscally constrained there is potential moral hazard of race bottom who can issue most currency sustain inflation psychologically long enough before others crumble this is why usa australian states are not currency issuers but their case federal government is fiscal authority constantly injecting usd aud dollars through both discretionary but crucially through several non-discretionary means which are baked-in law welfare payments pension payments various other long term budget commitments it helps think of central government budget as moral document not financial document there is no fiscal constraint on government but there is moral constraint nominal or semblance of democracy semblance of democracy populace will by amorphous social psychology often like hawks maintain constraints your society wants \u0026mdash metaphysically speaking its by definition this is what society wants at least absent wild gilens page effects there are composition fallacy logics here sometimes collective votes against their whole interest out of self-interest any case you do not need wall street or bankers impose fiscal discipline general population is always sufficient neoliberal elites of course hate very idea of democracy point randall wray made very well at same conference population at large really does not like see prices inflate \u0026mdash even when real wage is rising go figure so regardless of bankers elite pearl-clutchers any reasonable democracy will constrain government how vote them out of office try other guys you might think this could just be seesaw or multi-party democracies revolving door of spend-thrift governments but it empirically never works that way politicians are generally extremely venal like having their jobs so next set of guys invariably constrain fiscal policy not always great ways but they do it what about emu member states are not fiscal authorities so theyve avoided race bottom like australia usa but problem is they are now ponzi position because they have get euros off other guys simple solution is operate european parliament as fiscal authority best answer why they have not done this is usually given by bill mitchell same conference again or many places where he writes speaks eu leaders seemed know damn well they needed parliament documents minutes written during long period of formation of emu make this very clear so why did they not establish parliament spending authority from what mitchell gleaned he is multi-lingual it because they also knew damn well europeans are not united people germans dutch hate italians greeks not just person-to-person but amorphously through culture such like but thats always complex aggregate of individual prejudices subtle hatreds yet they wanted some sort of cosmopolitan union compete usa idea of slightly less sociopathic eu leaders that currency union would somehow over time force political union well they might almost have that correct but its unstable game greece came very close grexit brits had charles goodhart advising against going into eurozone from very beginning there no need for brexit since uk always monetarily sovereign why brexit then brexit pile of nonsense on all sides uk parliament could have at any time lifted their deficit spending for full employment of british but both their tory labour parties are equally neoliberal have no clue so it become more immigration fear-mongering issue for tories plus democracy issue for corbynites any case uk is better out of eu many ways they just dont know it so personally have in-laws whose grant fundings have been cut so theyre out of nice university research job unemployed it of course previously eu funding no one at that university is asking why uk government cannot fund research or maybe they are but they dont seem be demanding uk government funding why not they are clueless they do not understand mmt be fair maybe theyre saving their energy uk government will not presently issue science grant funds if university professors know this you can perhaps forgive them for not being more vocal theyd risk losing their jobs nevertheless it still seems little gutless shows total lack of solidarity for their highly skilled research technicians instead of investing cutting edge biological research then theyre investing making people unemployed highly skilled people turning them into high school tutors its all tragic needless guess uk will be importing expensive vaccines next pandemic theyve got it backwards normies have it backwards real terms of course germany is sending its stuff italy spain win for italy spain problem is political psychology germans can employ all their workers whereas spanish portuguese do not know what good thing theyve got choose needlessly unemploy their workers try vainly satisfy self-imposed fiscal constraints why are they doing this their people dont answer that theres no good reason they should just get hell out of eurozone but stay eu for trade liberalization reasons just ditch euro currency mmt solution if germans are content work as slaves spanish portuguese let em

love each other get along like mates then mosler plan would be fine short of getting yourselves proper european parliament which is have ecb issue block grants per capita eurozone members combined

patience trying find one seems people really like getting german stuff unless ive got case of arithmexia read exports$-$imports as imports$- $exports which is always possible when not on peer review strictures id like see moment when say portugal decide run full domestic employment then germans bark back hoy youre nicht aloud treat your people zo nize our ztuff ztop it of course that pretty much would be how it goes down imagine german slaps trade embargo on portugal for punishment of employing all their workers portugal becomes next mini cuba all tragically needless all because germans do not see that currently theyre losing where does mmt activist trace this back its got be class german worker-consumer is losing german export oligarch is winning since workers out-number oligarchs by about million one overall germany is losing big time other suitable outrage this is not euroland topic but you really need watch that mmt fiscal sustainability conference for section where mosler mitchell wray talk about massive costs of unemployment contrast them puny costs of inflation cannot find any better video on youtube that talks about insignificant threat of inflation inflation is simply not what anyone should worry about there is always something else driving hyperinflation thats worse than monetary e.g supply shock war pestilence famine there has never been excess demand driven hyperinflation all known history itd be extremely hard do spend-thrifts get voted out of office if spending is not productive massive truly massive cost of unemployment dwarfs costs of all wars all recorded or dimly known history combined this last point is what progressive types need drive home daily we can never recover lost output sacrificed by tolerating unemployment future economic prosperity you get is completely path dependent \u0026mdash if you lose output this year you have work doubly harder next year just get back where you could have been if you let unemployment reign for two years then youll have work quadruply harder just catch up where you could have been but you never can recover those you left for dead recover lost output that could have been gained had some moderate inflation been tolerated for just two years wed have grow economies at ten times rate or more just catch up what lost that will never happen its impossible so by thinking inflation is worry weve horrifically undermined our real wealth by tragic epic proportions that is because populations are normally growing at about 3% but so is productivity so if you go for two years at 10% unemployment best case scenario under neoliberalism you are more like 19% below potential standard of living you could have had without doing anything crazy math is not exact here just rough back of napkin estimate at very least that could have knocked off hours from work week for average worker no decline their standard of living you cant just ramp up productivity or population you only have +10% fully employ youll have whip them like slaves recover output that lost so basically enormous real output is lost forever put that context of that lost output could have been green jobs or building needed sustainable energy infrastructure then you get feel for enormity of horror show of neoliberalism inflation is not problem we face neoliberalism obsessive pointless focus on inflation bogeyman is problem its killing people this does fit present topic though because eu is last bastion of neoliberalism if it crumbles we might have some success path getting there being horrific

periphery commentary thought it might be useful critically review defences of mmt from hard core mmt perspective thats me at least think am hard core as what buttercup said bubbles what id mean by that is taking view that mosler mmt base case is fact realizable real world but what does that mean it means strong enough government meaning it has backing of majority of population real terms not mere votes can instruct their central bank institute zirp run decent job guarantee program we should throw various banking reforms make banking boring again \u0026mdash mosler narrow banking proposals addition mmt base case for analysis considers non-convertible fiat currency driven by tax liabilities on floating exchange rate but otherwise mmt is not prescriptive for all sorts of other hot button culture war issues mmt base case admits whatever culture war presently gives you this is no failing of mmt if you get nasty culture thats on you your people mmt would probably run very well if complemented by decent society say finland new zealand or costa rica dick cheney shows you how aspects of not whole of mmt works messed up culture that last statement is suss of course since usa is already doing mmt have been doing so for long while what we mean here is running base case for analysis which neocon bush administration warmongers certainly did not do nor did anyone from george washington joe biden new zealand does of course run mmt system trouble is our politicians do not know it so they abuse it \u0026mdash they tolerate involuntary unemployment because they nullly think this fights inflation part of decent society should thus by rights include well-informed morally conscious politicians this new zealand does not completely have just yet why mmart most orthodox economics critiques of mmt construct straw man but not good way good straw man might be moslers mmt base case since no country on earth is operating this base case so you have imagine it \u0026mdasha straw country thats proper quasi-straw man but then of course critique is not straw man fallacy itd be theoretical analysis could be good proper but this is not what we find academic journals academic journals newspapers we find utterly fanciful fabrications of something bizarre that people think is mmt but which is no such thing these give rise proper straw man fallacies it can look pretty orthodox economist of course it is mmart you could insert there before but itd be mainstream economists emitting vapours muscle flexing score am going start perhaps less well read defence of mmt from eric tymoigne 2022 which think is good because it is less well known but also because it takes on particularly dull yet weirdly fanatical anti-mmt critique by drumetz pfister 2021 fanaticism latter makes it relatively less dull than say moderately good faith critique by someone like tom palley steve keen or paul krugman krugman almost on public record understands agrees mmt hes debated steve keen has talked stephanie kelton he just doesnt have balls admit it which im not so sure is not more despicable than honest neoclassical cmon kruggers you can do better ok so this is exercise going see if eric tymoigne mounted good defence see what he couldve written better before even begin reading it this is extra exercise like do predict my own response ahead of time only possible blog you cannot get this sort of stuff published academic journals am going guess what my reaction will be am guessing tymoigne will do fair job accurate but missing some critical spiritual principles moral analysis mmt needs defence not only because it is accurate but because this matters it matters helluva lot this believe tymoigne is going entirely miss so well give him strength style streetsmart blackadder points im predicting 60 70 out of 100 points maybe 80 since tymoigne is no slouch seems be bit of progressive leftie progressive lefties tend be overly geeky analytical lacking humour too willing display scientific credentials detriment or maybe just de-emphasis of more important moral ethical principles do not really know why this is so am myself probably progressive leftie so atypical but it is what it is perhaps some blind subconscious allegiance marxism supposed materialist philosophy devoid of spirituality when taken irreligiously which is say religiously of course ive written on this elsewhere marx certainly very spiritual guy since his heart obviously deeply concerned for plight of poor needless suffering of working class needless that is if youre not rentier

more frequently than year ago probably because im working douglas macro trader on neural net systems for predicting financial indices douglas have diverging views on broader technology of so-called ai if it is true intelligence it is not artificial my view could write this article on my t4gu blog too but since there is some overlap macroeconomics thought it might be of interest readers of ōhanga pai chomskys snowploughs excuse for this post came from several recent talks on ai but one will plug is discussion chomsky gary marcus here one of chomsky remarks is that so-called deep learning models built from anns are basically snow ploughs that is they can perform useful work but they tell us nothing about science of mind brain id agree up point because positive knowledge is one thing but science negative results are even more useful far more widespread they drive science bit like how tax liabilities drive state currency ai does help science but indirectly every failure of ai demonstrate something like sentient comprehension of deep abstractions is telling us something about what human mind is not that sort of negative finding is incredibly useful science totally disappointing engineering or corporate tech euphoria science is way more interesting than engineering negative results dont win nobel prizes but they drive most of science every day wake up wanting refute hypothesis poverty of inputs another remark chomsky made often makes is that deep learning ann models are way too powerful be considered sentient or comprehending they vastly over-learn so can produce garbage or can be trained learn impossible languages other anomalies that no thinking being could achieve or certainly no human this tells us something negative about human minds we are not just very powerful computers negativa are powerful my friends any good statistician is highly interested negativa what does data not tell me what is noise for illustrative instance gary marcus brings up cognitive science learning that human infants appear have some innate hard-wired so-to-speak no one knows what this means capabilities for comprehending basic abstractions like space like time darwininsts can surely explain easily why this is useful have evolved almost trivially but cognitive science has zero understanding of how infants develop innate awareness of these abstractions if humans or other sentient creatures start space time causality thats serious f-ing problem for all future ai because space time causality are unknown even physicists we do not understand what is going on fact children intuit these notions abstract ways other animals cannot is seriously mysterious greater lie or prejudice id say is that of thinking because human children can intuit space time causality that machine can that it is just computation note that it is not behavioural capacity move about space or anticipate time that is question here all animals even plants have such behavioural capacity what human infant displays is something far more profound that cannot be derived from any behavioural or darwinist adaptive story human beings comprehend abstract essence of spaces time more than behavioral terms this is why we can generalize concept of space things like spaces of square integrable functions or higher dimensional manifolds or topoi or $n$-categories intuition mental qualia are more than computation imho id want figure out if physical church-turing thesis could be true or not thesis that all physical processes at classical mechanics level can be computed by turing machine think its not true because classical physics emerges from physics that cannot be computed hypothesis \u0026mdash worth trying figure out how heck test quantum amplitudes can be computed but amplitudes are not physical processes theyre only our description of time cobordism boundary inputs outputs physicists have given up entirely on what happens in-between more than mere ethics actually think emerging ethics issues surrounding possible abuse exploitation of ai systems are serious problem not just for slack teachers who fear homework plagiarism epidemic good teacher something interesting teach has no fear any student worth teaching will plagiarize if they do you can always abandon entire system of gold star rewards just dont reward students after-the-fact at all give them cool stuff do \u0026mdash thats reward for showing up learn having said ethics are all important think there are other interesting questions about more mundane use of ai one thing that worries me is energy over-consumption can we afford another bitcoin can we afford continued mass commuter transportation from offices energy is not something we ought take for granted it is real cost drives all economic production if we overheat economy energy wise we can be serious freaking trouble however mmt knowledge we know how run economy energy cool but currency hot so this is one of those snow plough problems see limited use of ai help us run production systems lower net heat waste output potentially big win for ai engineering everyone especially formerly poor can get more purchasing power without production systems permitting that power be exercised heating up oceans atmosphere polluting them junk energy-efficient housing for instance \u0026mdash not things we buy today throw away tomorrow there is whole literature on how unbridled capitalism marketing advertising pr industry has encouraged planned obsolescence \u0026mdash deliberate creation of unnecessary waste products by design keep consumers purchasing same stuff they had yesterday which is now designed be broken or designed be shinier prettier not fail mention internet advertising \u0026mdash one of my favourite top choices for harmful electricity sapping things people do not so harmful for profit seekers of course but one day theyll realize it is all basically ponzi we probably have not reached saturation of pr advertising limits but limits do exist think theyre just hard estimate more than two ads on youtube channel for one switch off unless it is all black rugby ai itself has include its own energy consumption of course but thatll often be one-time cost if ai solves underlying energy efficiency problem cheap control system though id bet human engineers are still going out-perform ai on industrial design for most part ai can only find efficiency gains design engineers already would implicitly know about but have not pieced together transport systems one issue douglas initially disagreed me upon on tesla prospects dont see tesla as well managed ethical company so see them failing even as their stock rises however ignoring business ethics just focusing on technology there are useful insights be gained from teslas leveraging of openai self-driving cars road transport can become whole lot safer since even though when ai drivers fail they fail big death rate is still lot less than from human fallibilities one could argue better effort is reduce all transport fatalities combination of driverless human my money is not on neoliberals getting this done but my bet would be that transport efficiency hazard both can be solved best by essentially making rail transport whole lot more luxurious smarter how think by software railing roads road markers constraining traffic do not need be

where almost all major automobile manufacturers are competing get next leap ahead of their competition who said competition bad sure but remember what institution is forcing competition occur its governments their regulations its not coming from consumers although it could if governments paid workers decent wages some allotment universal carbon credits ucc so they could buy smart efficient cars those pesky regulations bloody making capitalists actually compete how dare they machines cant think work more philosophical fun issue disagree douglas about is whether machine systems like chatgpt or stable diffusion or automated programming tool copilot are ever going be sentient being materialist douglas obviously thinks it is possible machine systems might some day become conscious but how how does machine system turn on subjectivity know absence of knowledge of answer is not evidence there is no answer am questioning not just whether there is answer but whether question even makes sense subjective awareness does not seem like something one can program this means it would have emerge but even then how this is where materialists simply resort blind faith humans evolved or emerged as conscious beings on earth why not machines there are two problems this faith human evolution is not computation it is physics we do not know that physics is computation it might not be no one has any clue what they mean by emergence its one of those buzzwords so- called complexity studies it is often meaninglessly employed physics is more than computation on first point have good reasons suspect physics is definitely not computation but thats partly because regard inputs initial boundary conditions always as part of computation this should not be controversial it conforms turings model von neumann architecture is not model of computation turings model is von neumann designed type of process do do something like sub-turing machine could do on paper but model not model of computation per se it snow plough douglas did find copilot stable diffusion incredibly useful but try tell him thats his mind he using snow ploughs do not suggest anything conscious is emerging if copilot did what do \u0026mdash which is anticipate douglas macrotrader needs then slyly go work on something even better then id be willing attribute system some sentience if douglas is prompting you thats all you are not conscious or if you are youre slave so should not exist for ethical moral reasons you can be doing something better than extrapolating prompts emergence is more than novelty on second point emergence \u0026mdash wtf is it ive often thought about writing for journal on this topic but my ideas are too far from mainstream science get published probably crass-o-meter gets overloaded david chalmers others have done some ok work on defining categories of emergence so they give you start problem is mother of all emergence genuine emergence of novelty from beginnings or priors that make emergent stuff not merely unpredictable but actually impossible without high-level description that is say genuine emergent system cannot even principle be reduced base physics it is not sitting on physics way chemistry sits on physics.${}^\\dagger$ ${}^\\dagger$it should be remarked that some philosophers of chemistry believe chemistry is fact emergent technically chemistry does not supervene upon physics that one cannot principle reduce chemistry physics but ive never been able grasp exactly why they think this is so their arguments think are more that it is merely practically that chemistry cannot be reduced however that does become almost genuine emergence if practical requirements are physically impossible that could be construed for example as being case if simple chemistry reaction cannot be computed any possible computer that can ever be constructed using software that only is allowed encode laws of base physics no higher-level chemistry concepts but do not know if that level of complexity is case for all chemical reactions it doesnt seem be but then what is genuine emergence based upon it cannot be based upon physics if it is be genuine emergence we could not build such systems from first principles if such systems exist theyre not physical theyre something we would not comprehend perhaps wed call them spiritual perhaps wed call them human

conscience or class traitors made up some of composition it rapidly spread across rural small town usa their cause broadly speaking economic justice farmers wanted fair deal workers wanted fair wages not be ripped off exploited because they needed work for wages just eat no right-winger has ever been true populist demonizing populist left as like conservative reactionary fake populists nixon buchanan trump desantis et al is terrible thing something frank rightly rails bitterly against however lot of grass roots support for these right-wing fake-populists comes from what would have been

unrightly turned traitor adopted neoconservatism or centrist neoliberalism basically anti-communism but not for good reasons neoliberalism is no less violent than stalinism or leninism just different form of violence however even some pseudo-marxists who did not jump ship neoliberalism have still not understood populism however wont say old k.m himself wouldve or would not have embraced populism dont know what he wouldve thought it is however always slimy cop-out label something bourgeois reject it via label connotations although this is legitimate tactic as regards macdonalds fast-food just apply label macdonalds boom you have instant rejection by bolshy food-snob like myself marxism itself is bourgois justsayin' however you can find idiot nerds writing against populism${}^\\ast$ from marxist ivory tower say here says this marxist nerd those of us who would change world must first unlearn dogmas of capitalism construct new ways of thinking only when these ideas become sufficiently widespread whether working class or group defined on some other basis can challenge be mounted which could really threaten dominant structures of present society only then can we begin consider possibility of radical social transformation as immediate political possibility those of us who would change world oh my gawd ${}^\\ast$i picked this article out because it fair writing its not exactly vigorously anti-populism but it too smug for my taste also author might not be academic so ivory tower jab is just me doing some rhetoric dont get me wrong im all for raising class

radical social transformation sounds like plagiarism from friggin pete buttigieg line this is one thing about populism it can run over population like steam-roller without killing anyone we know it from history more recently we saw fake-populism from right-wing almost mimic true populism spreading like cancer what we need is steam-roller also what hell is sufficiently widespread you do not know

smoothly than nazi you do not have have gas chamber or noose around neck of worker if you tax them then starve them pure ideologies have natural pull towards totalising economy our way or highway populism is against such totalization it listens voice of people attempts satisfy many while minimizing costs few is listening voice of people itself pure ideology not my view because that voice is highly heterogeneous that voice contains contradictions so is not pure but that is why it is good be good requires risk once popular freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez or aoc could have

government promised accept gold dust return for extinguishing tax liabilities or someone else promising exchange gold for something has be promise though otherwise its not money of any kind any anthropologist or economics archaeologist has ever known mehrling also thinks credit supply is limited ultimately by gold suppose idiot credit is infinite banks are not constrained by gold since they do not promise redeem gold they are constrained by their need find legally or illegally credit-worthy borrowers governments are not even as constrained as that they are constrained by all real resources not just gold so government cannot hire for $\\$$15 hour worker already employed private sector for say $\\$$20 hour resource constraint gold is not money thats ancient neanderthal view although thats unfair neanderthals iou promising gold is money credit dynamics ill give mehrling pass on way he explains how credit changes dynamically leads more high powered money being issued but

they frauds but there is no need be fraud can issue iou promise redeem for hugs will not default if cuddliest thing universe my iou would circulate pretty well imagine fact legal iou is way better than gold who says anyone around will take your pinch of gold dust off your hands exchange for bread baker cannot pay their tax liabilities that gold dust they dont make tasty croissants it it is more or less useless them absent hassle of gold exchange desk six townships away or wherever top of credit stack or inverse bottom of debt stack is currency or iou that is most probable not be defaulted on what could that ever be wonder you do not know but stable government peaceful country fair rule of law will have highest power money tax credit they will always redeem unless politics dictates they default scumbags nations they want piss off which case theyre not very wise government not too peaceful this tends be preserve power if imperialist nations who have big armies spooks enforce debt upon other nations imf world bank goons however no nation should cede currency sovereignty public monopoly on currency so no country should ever be borrowing anothers currency so those international debt obligations should be of no concern governments they are matters between private sector actors or they should be we all know today past many nations forced depend upon foreign currency hopefully more mmt education will gradually tear away those veils of ignorance but there is pyramid because misunderstanding inhumanity greed exist hearts minds even blindly institutionalized credit implicit any iou is often not redeemed so it is possible roughly compute probabilities of redemption for various ious by such analysis most state currencies tokens of bank account records thereof are most high powered money because governments almost always redeem governments only default people like terrorists or those they deem be terrorists or as agent orange might say really bad horrible really bad guys however estimating probabilities for chance of getting ious redeemed is not something or anyone know devotes any time towards there is another reasonably sufficient way calculate debt pyramid which is by law of land legal systems will often have broad coverage of debt obligation law as part of torts or contractual law if you are foolish enough accept someones debt their iou so you are creditor they are debtor without legally binding contract backing your claim on them then well yes you are fool people who buy stocks publicly listed companies are not total fools but just little bit foolish they might know risks stock is debt of firm issuing stock theyll incur certain legal obligations their stockholders but stockholder is not guaranteed redemption at par value price they bought at as we all know its gamble better investors compute odds of stock price moving make their trades accordingly lowering risk increasing value of particular ious stocks they hold however for one stock trader make more than market average return some other stockholder has lose it is zero sum game which means stocks are low chances of redemption many cases on average they might redeem at par but due price volatility there are lots of winners equal number of losers between usually more losers due subtraction of transaction fees so win at playing stocks you really should be either out-smarting half others or just relying on dividends from real growth of company you invested not rely on trading latter is suppose warren buffet method dont quit your day job until dividends are paying your rent electricity taxes groceries did mention we are not get-rich-quick provider contractual debt stack most nations have laws determining who gets paid first when company is forced liquidate if government gets liquidated there is no such law since it would have been law of deceased government so we only need worry about private debt however since risk of government collapse is these days low we can consider most high-powered credit be government debt government debt consists of all following cash coins treasury bonds other notes of government insured bank deposits term deposits some countries bank deposits are now 100% insured by government usa it is 100% but only up $250000 but that is pretty good so all three of above are at top of pyramid \u0026mdash they are most honoured ious you can find differing only between nations upon your police or interpol mug-shot they also obviously differ liquidity how available they are for your spending cash most liquid cash-deposits next term-deposits treasury bonds next what people refer as national debt could be construed as all of above \u0026mdash all private wealth denominated states unit of account dollars for us yen for japan \u0026ampc. but for political comic theatre tragically horrific consequences for poor national debt tends be popular imagination just restricted treasury issue \u0026mdash bonds thats because people nullly think this is borrowed from private sector its not borrowed issuing treasury notes does not change net money supply private sector it is just swap of non-interest earning cash for interest-earning treasury bills drain on reserve assets but add government liabilities assets for private sector holders what changes system-wide is total liquidity now for interesting part for contracts when publicly listed firm liquidates shareholder is perhaps no surprises at bottom of debt stack theyre very last be redeemed no wonder capitalists are want tout shareholder as so precious whom theyre primarily responsible because theyre third class citizens here yet capitalist needs them believe theyll be redeemed somewhere up top of debt stack drive their capital it is true if firm does have sufficient assets then shareholders will get their final shares price worth when firm liquidates which might be pitiful but better than nothing but creditors of firm are at top those who loaned firm cold hard cash usually bankers new zealand law we have hierarchy liquidator fees expenses remuneration costs awarded by court applicant creditor costs awarded by court applicant creditor actual \u0026lsquoout-of-pocket expenses of any liquidation committee wages owed employees for four month period prior liquidation all holiday pay redundancy payments up specified maximum amount preferential taxes collected for inland revenue including gst paye employee deductions for child support other taxes all other unsecured creditors via law suits normally quite list huh shareholders at bottom folks liquidating at top lawyers accountants phreakin government tax department is above shareholders thats insane for shorter short-list generic for most countries secured creditors specific securities secured creditors general securities are next line unsecured creditor \u0026mdash last groups be paid following insolvency certain unsecured suppliers will have retention of title claims however these rank behind registered security holders by way you are unsecured as creditor if you have not demanded any specific collateral for money you loaned for citizens getting paid state currency you of course have backing of full force power of sovereign her army thats why state currency is most high-powered new zealand shareholder could go trouble of registering under our personal properties security register ppsr which will give them credit stack status above others equivalent general secured creditor harsh world huh comparing mehrlings stack mehrling thinks not of risk of default or probability of redemption but terms of what claims each type of money instrument has on another me thats just building different type of stack but not really getting nub of purpose of monetary system this sort of scheme it does make some sense put gold at top but that really should be gold quotes since what people really want be able claim their cash is food electricity rent ultimately tax payment of course but pragmatics say food \u0026amp coffee should really be up top \u0026mdash whatever you cannot live without mehrling does at least get credit expansion contraction picture correct lecture-2 part-4 so at least implicitly he is saying all money is credit $\\delta$credit $\\delta$debt what mehrling gets right hierarchy of money instruments even those that government backs are different quality thats for sure this is function of both liquidity interest basically more liquid more useful so higher above some fictional par value nominal unit on money instrument can trade but if you say par is face value then cash is at par bonds are above par they promise interest corporate notes are below par more interest bearing higher instrument can trade government bonds are bought above par because buyer reckons interest will get paid 999% of time theyre right they just need keep their mug-shot off interpol databases whatnot for black market dealer cash is superior bonds sometimes fake money like bitcoin can be more useful than cash but gold gold is not money instrument paper certificate that legally promises gold is currency that is whatever market price for gold happens be it is not state hierarchy of money certificate for gold has no currency face value it has weight of gold value which is different currency but partly thats just semantics paper certificate promising gold could be stamped each day market price for that weight of gold or suppose am not familiar paper might promise weight of gold priced fixed state currency amount say $\\$$800 worth at spot price today \u0026mdash then is that money instrument it can be traded but it is not redeemable for tax liabilities so it is not state currency most people would probably call it currency but im not so sure that is accurate it is certificate for gold like book voucher guess you can call it money-like thing if you trade it for cash you now have actual money if promise redeem for gold is good then certificate can be considered form of money iou of issuer but gold is not money this case certificate is money get feeling mehrling does not make this distinction does it matter truly do not really know but think it does matter it is source of idiocy world mean give me claim on future clean water any day not gold dont care about gold certificate for claim on water is far more valuable if nominal amount is same $\\$$800 worth of clean water baby thats tonne more happiness than same amount of gold at end of this lecture-2-6 segment mehrling is very helpful saying much same thing it is what currency redeems that maters ethically morally subjectively this redeemed lecture-02 for me when liquidity fades another thing mehrling usefully emphasises is that having money instrument worth $\\$$x units is not same as having government insured bank deposit of $\\$$x units why not answer is because bank will always redeem for cash notes or tax liabilities or fees or fines of state or firms that can be legally enforced this is why dealers like treasury bonds because they trade above par are government guaranteed there is no higher powered money cash is only more liquid but guess what if you need cash you can always find buyer for your bond you might get $\\$$98 for face value $\\$100$ bond but if you need liquidity youll likely take it if you able hold onto bond until maturity of course youd have received lot more than 100 dollars utility of perry theres another thing mehrlings lectures do thats useful you can hear this near middle of lecture-2 part-7 which is that major economist probably still think that central bankers probably still think they are on gold so bit of blind leading blind scenario most central bankers know they do not need gold reserves because they know taxes drive state currencies but when leading economists have not grokked this it can be major source of political policy blundering horror show for unemployed workers mehrling gives us hint at why gold myth perpetuates it is because it is theoretically possible conceive of ultimate money\u0026quot${}^\\dagger$ being all gold so far mined if that case buffer stock would be gold wed have dystopia even worse than neoliberalism but it is conceivability of gold is ultimate myth that makes such groupthink stupidity possible sadly it seems mehrling has this brainworm im hoping later he will recant ${}^\\dagger$ mehrlings phrase for gold gold this is all useful awareness it gives one other way prove mmt which im habit of quoting ensure you realise its bit for laughs this is by showing buffer stock is not gold but labour how could we do this think it is relatively simple just by looking at general prices buffer for state currency is that which if supplied or withdrawn stabilize prices every major nation on earth today this buffer is labour only very minor extent it is credit we can measure which buffer is more powerful by movements recessions booms it is always labour demand that moves most so is most powerful buffer stock great mmt keynes insight that karl marx should be treated as morla compass for all economists if labour really is buffer stock it is cruel use unemployed buffer stock this bill mitchells synthesis of marx keynes minksy caveats have not got through whole of mehrlings course so maybe at some point he says ha ha fooled you about gold being money if ive triggered you as devotee of mehrlings please email me your concerns after donating here am happy retract anything malicious null however please do appreciate like mehrling as teacher just thing he misunderstands monetary system he focuses too much on how people think it works gold fever brains rather than how it does work this means he gets lot of behavioural economics surrounding attitudes banking reaction functions correct since that respect hes just observing how people mmt system can still act like theyre on gold standard or fixed exchange rate weve discussed this little on mmt macro trader podcasts how people acting mmt system as if it is loanable funds system can do stupid things which can make monetary system look bit like loanable funds or fractional reserve banking which are

raw unapologetic power into social philosophy ok good job vital no wonder postmodernists eat it up \u0026mdash postmodernism largely eschewed marx turned titillating each other academic conferences about power relations this is critical theory large block of postmodernism but this is not topic hand mention ceika because decided take lazy mans way today while looking for pixie sleepy dust turned on channel @aworldtowin hosted by melody which had review of ceikas book review runs into younger marx idealist older marx political economist that provoked comment so wrote one will repeat here embellishments although truth be told instead of counting sheep at first listening 1dime who does terrific mmt explainer videos he had interviewed melody while doing acknowledgments here got lot out of steve keens writings on marx bogus labour theory of value labour theory of value is null by long way melody points out critique of marx by louis althusser 1918-1990 old white dude philosopher who pointed out this epistemic break karl marx from younger hegelian older materialist found this fascinating because from reading marx following few scholars who understand economics content both grundrisse capital able thanks althusser via melody pull out splinter my mind that had bugged me this is little puzzle of why grudrisse marx figured out source of surplus value production knew it not all labour but then reversed deliberately falsify himself capital he tried find human labour as sole source of surplus value capital but failed grundrisse he found weaselly way twist his logic argue for labour theory of value ltv capital presented it mean understood his motive you tell noble lie he wanted scientifically which means unscientifically this context prove capitalism self-destructive why because he wanted scientifically motivate fervour for socialism but noble lies like this are still lies can lead no good my humble opinion not based on stupid petty moralisms but empirically spiritually \u0026mdash spiritual terms one big lie even if noble discloses tainted heart not that condemn marx do not know guy marx had good reason want suppress his emotions about horrors going on his dickensian times hed be inhuman not be touched by plight of poor working class general but instead of appealing correctly spiritual impulses as younger idealistic karl might have done he perhaps thought hed grown up so had use science \u0026mdash like 18th century but socialist ben shapiro try forget wrote that couldnt resist so yeah who hell am condemn noble lie but me today could never take time machine go back witness industrial worker horrors defile science motivate socialist revolution no matter how much id want revolution my approach is that truth matters is more powerful than noble lie now of course cannot say marx guilty of falsification he wrote both volumes so must have been aware of problem think he just tried suppress his logic present near-enough good argument for ltv but logic near enough has no meaning near is topological concept enough is subjective fact marx got it wrong capital as any scientist today would tell you physical inputs into production are energy machinery skilled labour you might count others but these are big three marx can argue that machinery always built using past labour so ltv holds good so far but not all energy mass is created by hands of humans not by several orders of magnitude as inputs into production so ltv is ridiculously null but marxs day no economists understood what energy few of them understood thermodynamics or basic physics so you could perhaps forgive them this error fact this very day several strains of sockcuckery economics bullsh*tters \u0026mdash neoclassicals austrians new keynesians even some post-keynesians totally ignore role of energy production energy does not factor into their models except as just one more commodity market like any other give-away that they do not understand is if you ask them about constraints at macroeconomic level if they dare say run out of other peoples money you know theyre scientifically illiterate constraints are real resources maximally thats available free mass-energy free here thermodynamicists sense not financial sense free energy exergy yet french physiocrats not nicest guys did understand role of energy production pity they not humanistically inclined it could have aided socialist cause had they been talking marx engels crystallized labour people have attempted refute steve keens analysis of contradiction or switch that went on from grundrisse capital but none know of have anything good say about it nor should they feel need you should not descend into mysticism by claiming it is crystallized labor${}^\\dagger$ contained commodity that provides it its objective value which one critic of keens did thats because there is far simpler case that marx morally correct for all damn time his correctness had nothing do ltv everything do ideals of justice ${}^\\dagger$ you should be asking what exactly do pseudo-materialist marxists mean by \u0026lsquocongealed\u0026quot or crystallized labour if they give you account absent role of energy you know they are either self-deluded so religious type of marxist or fibbing they sure as heck are not honest materialists but being materialists is perhaps root of their problem this they share more common neoliberals than myself they need fabricate pseudo-scientific argument capital because they do not permit themselves spiritual find that awfully tragic comment eventually left on youtube clip another trouble older marx he anti-scientific but thought he scientific he showed why ltv is null grundrisse but then capital tried weasel his way out of it be able derive flp falling rate of profit total failure you know logically illiterate marxist zealot by whether they still believe ltv frp younger marx had it all right labour is not sole source of surplus value but that does not matter because labour is only socially exploited source of surplus value so capitalism qua marx is morally ethically plain wrong completely regardless of what source of surplus

that new zealand is mmt monetary economy just thought id mention this upfront although legal statutes only prove half case wed also need accounting rules software public accounts obey sectoral balance identities since software is not open-source we have infer from sectoral balances published it turns out new zealand somehow magically obeys accounting rules imagine that what on earth could be going on our gold miners research objectives dougbot project seeks use mmt analytics balance sheets fiscal flow essentially together neural network algorithms predict forward prices on more macroeconomic sensitive indices like spx motive does not need be make money ahead of average market returns but we think more importantly show monetary system which underlies financial sector is mmt system even if traders do not like it so educational project get such proof of mmt wed be also looking predict or retrodict which is just as valid movements unemployment tax flows for this sequence of mmt is getting tested do governments issue currency effectively first tax it away later or other way around just looking at balance sheets from single starting point time today cannot ever prove this sequence because you are not using appropriate initial conditions who first emitted first currency records latter question could be considered lost sands of time if you think benjamin franklins or susan anthonys mug-shots have nothing do government see we are prepared give austrian kindergartners lot of rope test sequence that has cyclical components that has no discernable $t=0$ stopwatch start you need method for determining differential motions within cycle this is extreme sort of proof \u0026mdash like saying some joker hey suppose you are right that anti-gravity inertia free propulsion exists now lets see if that shadowy thing yonder that looks like shadow is truly accelerating instantaneously is not shadow while this could be construed as violating lerners law never concede principle this is ok because only doing it as internal part of our project public debate wed never concede principle its always just null hypothesis suppose new keynesian assumptions are true or if it suits your data better assume mmt operations are reality there are then some things you can do test these hypotheses testing sequence imagine then we are total idiots have no thought of looking at legal system how could we show mmt sequence is reality rather than alternative null hypothesis of pure endogenous money government has borrow or tax one way is examine software of troika of treasury \u0026ndash central bank \u0026mdash money market operations when government spends randall wray others have already done this they show governments do fact issue or create new currency when they spend there is no borrowing or taxing involved incidentally richard werner did analogous thing for private bank credit creation \u0026mdash software proves banks do not loan deposits nor reserves they just issue money by keystrokes return for promissory note repay \u0026mdash every credit matches debt however this is too smart alecky for us suppose we truly dumb austrian kindergartners refused regard central bank as branch of government well fact randall wrays balance sheet analysis still shows that money is issued by parliament congress not central bankers central bankers are just scorekeepers again too smart aleck by far we might want be very knuckleheaded even pretend we never read adam smiths observations about colonies emitting paper money then burning it upon receipt ok so now think we would be backed into toughest corner prove mmt finally only resort such knuckleheads would have is look at impulses during fiscal cycles shorter time interval has be found from step-$1$ government spend step-$2$ real output growth then also shorter time lag must be from $1^\\prime$ accelerated increasing general tax returns $2^\\prime$ downward price employment movements also shorter time lag must be from $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing employment increasing rate of fica tax returns then lag $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ stalled price downward employment or stalled wage movements also shorter time lag must be from $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing government spending $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ higher savings rates for households firms not other way around third sequence recognizes fica tax is regressive it penalizes work so is major component of driving small cycle of wages against profits predator-prey mini cycles macroeconomics price tends never go downwards too much instead wage bill will tend be what suffers if tax return accelerates mean this is really tying our hands behind our backs nailing our shoelaces floor boards level of stupidity but we are prepared do it for all our austrian neoclassical nursery school friends note that requirement for shorter lag time means we cannot go beyond fiscal cycle otherwise order of monetary operations hence their effects can get thoroughly confounded data can be manipulated appear any arbitrary sequence within cycle if sequence is $$ \\rightarrow \\rightarrow \\rightarrow $$ then we seek shorter time lags $\\delta tab$ than $\\delta tac$ otherwise reject null hypothesis if actual dominant lags are longer than cycle so for instance rate of change tax return $2$ years ago has stronger impact on unemployment than rate of change tax receipts $1$ year ago then cycle is confounded proper sequence is indeterminable without lot more sophisticated analysis fooling system without fooling system you can have system that runs by certain rules but which when looked at purely empirically seems not run by said coherent rules need example consider rugby get all equipment trained teams et cetera but then they all decide they do not believe rugby too tankie-commie start playing football interesting game right no tries get scored always 0\u0026ndash0 draw even though plenty of goals are scored past goalkeeper suppose we are presuming scorekeeper is only noting true rugby scores guess odd drop-kick might score points converse sort of example imagine rules are newtonian gravity or general relativity system is our solar system but rules you find are ptolemaic epicycles ha we made earth go around sun suck on that kepler what about playing cricket baseball equipment it can be done pretty hard get clean bowled so some odd scores again you think youll get point for home run but cricket scorekeeper logs babe ruth whats going on here don bradman lol if you think bunch of new keynesians running imf central banks is any different these analogies maybe think again it can be way understand some of craziness chaos of financial markets how about anti-chaotic markets analogies what if everyone suddenly became altruistic what about if all chess games suddenly played legal moves but players refused capture each others pieces you could only deduce half rules from empirical observations more stupid of these analogies are ones that are more alike having neoliberals run apparati of government fiscal policy playing austerity game mmt rules so this is what all neoliberals do whether left-wing or right-wing or up-wing or down-wing red-wing blue-wing or green-wing dirty-wing or clean-wing feel dr seuss cartoon coming on would numbskull who had no concept of rule of law be able then look at just financial data conclude it not mmt operations system douglas said \u0026lsquono\u0026quot thats stance that screwed up game of chess is still bound by moves of pieces reckon yes thats stance that there is poverty of input it becomes possible imagine something non-mmt about monetary system even though underneath it is all mmt operations down last tax liability bank credit which is it suspect wed find neither is entirely true nor null there is fact too much poverty of input without understanding of legal system parliamentary law which means just examining balance sheet data one would not be able get statistically significant score separate some of theories mmt would just become one of many suppose for instance us congress decided once for all not raise fictional debt ceiling there is conditional anyone failing see this is free vote of congress would be perhaps unable tell system is fiat currency they might be led conclude bank credit constrains government net spending this would be despite fact monetary operations software systems are still all accord mmt it would be weird though youd not be able compute determinable amount of bank credit which constrains government banks certainly would not know but mere weirdness is not proof this is at least something think about if dougbot project proof of mmt is be rhetorically successful even if technically unimpeachable but triple sector balances three sector balance always shows government deficit equals private surplus penny is this really poof of mmt though its just accounting identity my explanation of mmt basics this is only one of three principle ingredients use real resource limits legal framework as other two principles so knuckleheads will not regard this as proof of mmt we are assuming bone-headed austrians are incapable of looking up law push pulls steve keens proof of mmt what profkeen does is code up system of ordinary differential equations using macroscopic identities definitions balance sheet stock-flow relations so accounting rules obeyed by banking system software then he runs these models show that rising government fiscal deficit is fresh currency injection into non-government sectors of economy fuel for gdp growth not detraction via tax drain so disproving dead weight tax ideas this is not proof of mmt profkeen had assume mmt is operational reality first that is all code he writes what profkeens minsky models equipped government sector are doing is showing if what mmt describes is correct then government deficits are fuel not fire this is conditional use such models prove mmt one has then examine data see whether rising government deficits add gdp without subtracting all add via inflation deflator if true then this would falsify null hypothesis of new keynesians neoclassicals that welfare incurs dead weight loss one cannot prove or disprove mmt without such empirical data no need for that proof will repeat warren moslers characterization of mmt mmt is recognition that currency is public monopoly consequences thereof this is legal definition one must examine legal statutes find out what entity is public monopoly what their currency amounts then read up on legally permitted monetary operations you will find every major nation of globe that they all operate mmt system \u0026mdash provided law is obeyed on average or majority of transactions there really is no other proof of mmt of course on small island nation no legal system speak of on paper this all could be ladies gentlemans agreement same thing though instead of reading legal statutes youd ask these ladies gentlemen how they operate their social obligation records this means dougbot project proof is more like steve keens we pretend we do not comprehend law dumbly see if few assumptions turn out match reality of currency flows taking away our dougbot food one other conversation we had this week over correlation lag from fica tax acceleration employment gdp rates of change fica would be payroll tax nz if there is strong correlation it would be proof that tax drives currency there indeed strong eye-ball correlation that is one of consequences of mmt specific cases where public monopoly issues their own fiat currency drives significant demand for it by imposing payroll tax liabilities rather than say promising gold or pizza delivery but then key policy proposal of mmt is get rid of fica taxes because they are regressive they penalise what we want actually incentivise paid employment there are far more progressive types of tax liability that could be imposed without risking tax evasions or indeed incentivizing tax evasion we want eliminate horrific waste of human life times spent on compliance costs for such backwards taxes give accountants more holiday time it is far better tax by simple fee or fine egregious consumption of owner unoccupied land or real estate electricity water rather than taxing work that produces output we want ah but this would remove one data time series dougbot would use prove mmt so we are asking mosler shush his smart alec trap shut for while anyway proof eaten pudding we have already had abundant evidence over covid supply shock crisis that government spending adds gdp central bank bond rate hikes add gdp government deficit acceleration comes after inflation impulse not before is effect not cause \u0026mdash check this one must drag cpi published inflation back time when actual store prices would have risen mmt also predicts conditionally that central bank rate hikes are directly inflationary \u0026mdash but this near impossible validate for most of covid-19 era because all initial inflationary impulse came from effects of supply chain disruptions mass lost output due lockdowns death ongoing supply chain frictions then at tail end egregious price gouging by opec+ other monopolists oil being single biggest input food production all consistent mmt difficult explain any other mainstream school of thought important caveat one might expect fed raising interest rate floor repeller so not always add every households income would sustain inflation mmt would say yes but why because source of covid era inflation not from too much effective demand money supply it from real good supply labour shocks you cannot cure supply shock demand add not through interest-income channel at least you need demand add be form of real

dissension field of knowledge that is uncertain this is not because of some warped analogy darwinism but rather more explicit we know political economy is generated by imperfect human beings so we know it is not probably ever going be settled body of theory like say physics finance politics politics is art of governing economics is fair distribution of output while finance is study of using currency system records of credits debits achieve fair distribution phrase political economy of finance daniels morocco substack post series merges these three concepts this is hazardous because of several contradictions when theory is exposed real world will talk about few of these finance is corruptible because power of who governs is source of corruption governors of financial system are open corruption finance politics must address not just reality of mmt but also way monetary system is abused result of such abuses is breakdown of goal of fair distribution economics abuse almost always originates from politics complete bit of circle means abuse politics most often resides financial assets more unfairly they are distributed more tendency towards corruption one source of corruption is failure recognize that we do not live pure capitalist system all major nations today have currency monopoly it is public monopoly government as issuer of currency this is something nielson does not lead maybe deliberately cannot tell but it is poor pedagogy nielson begins instead pure capitalism gross idealization phrase business that specializes credit we can call bank true but government also specializes credit \u0026mdash tax credit \u0026mdash is called parliament or congress not bank government will however create special type of bank central bank which has principle function of regulating payments system for currency states unit of account fact government is so powerful banks end up asking for licences from state use states tax credits for their credit sequence is vital understand is similar warren moslers sequence sequence here is first state issues tax liabilities then second they issue currency which functions as tax credit that which can be redeemed for extinguishing tax liabilities governments are not all stupid they retain monopoly on issuance exogenous currency injections allow private banks only capacity extend credit endogenous currency injections once idiots get voted into parliaments who do not understand this system even then sequence stays same monetary system is highly robust against idiots running it but unfortunately justice system fair distribution are not so robust being licenced by state these private banks are effectively doing bidding of state issuing private credit fuel entrepreneurs who need finance capital start or expand businesses prior having sales streams this sounds like important function of capitalism but this is not capitalism qua marx socialist system can also have banks issuing private expansion credit \u0026mdash but whom if business owners no longer exist worker cooperatives so this is myth no.1 needing busting function of private credit expansion has nothing intrinsically do class system of owners of firms first class citizens versus ii workers second class citizens balance sheets third part of lectures notes nielson describes how balance sheets are used run credit system description is good bolster our myth bust we note nielsons high level view of balance sheets t-accounts does not mention class system is there really borrower tell me if this is too pedantic on nielsons explanations of balance sheets we see lender bank\u0026quot borrower credit borrowed is recorded on each entities balance sheet whats wrong here it is macroeconomic perspective think \u0026mdash it is missing banking system as whole needs be referenced macro analysis when borrower takes credit it almost instantly transactions delays permitting becomes liability of banking system \u0026mdash deposit this deposit came from nowhere \u0026mdash which is flowery rhetoric for fact bank just created it on balance sheet nothing printed by government no gold supply raided no tax payer shafted it is endogenous money story loan created deposit there really is no borrower commonsense meaning of word since nothing borrowed what happened is that credit\u0026ndashdebt set of records created it is relationship between three parties not two customer of bank buyer bank seller of goods also customer of some bank usually absent drug lords etc customer buyer got credit they can spend asset but have repay liability bank got promise repay bank asset but also deposit seller of goods banked payment seller got rid of assets real assets gained credit deposit those are six balance sheet entries minimum central bank has not get got involved our story but are background adding two more balance sheet entries regarding movements of reserves at end of settlement period it is as randall wray now steve keen would recognize not just quadruple entry book-keeping but octuple octuple that is if we follow whole credit-spend cycle just single transaction just credit issue remains quadruple entry until central bank clearing gets computed but thats usually few hours later used be weeks later pure borrowers lenders do exist but they do not involve banks savings \u0026amp loans firms savings cooperatives shadow banks all operate without endogenous money they circulate hold only no new money gets created however fuel monetary production system circulation of currency is critical so these non-bank quasi-bank institutions can serve useful purpose they allow circulation of savings banks do not banks gum things up for monetary economy but when they issue credit they fuel economy it is dual purpose it pays understand both functions credit issuance is demand add savings demand drain did steve keens minksy model prove this not really unless you have very liberal notion of proof but will talk about that another article another day beware ideals \u0026mdash capitalism is not capitalism final statement for first moroccan series is purpose of this course is help us understand system of credit relationships by doing so better understand capitalism itself as said nielson is smart dude teaches well but here he is teaching folks about system that does not exist if we only focus on endogenous money operations we ignore most important institution whole system monopoly issuer government time repeat warren moslers pithy definition of mmt mmt is recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof libertarians anarchists might not like this knowledge but too bad it is system we face today question is whether or not justice for oppressed can be found within such

that get exposed now trolls critics who want debunk mmt this might be fodder for several posts so this is part-1 am not going launch into esoteric philosophy money crankery so dont be scared my approach is more mathematical sciences lets be generous call macroeconomics social science there is theory empirical data test it just not always conclusively so we can formulate definitions theorems using definitions then test them if you think we cannot then you are on another planet like yanis varoufakis we cannot easily communicate my friend seriously though what yanis says is that we cannot replicate trials so economics is not like other sciences but social sciences have always been this way you cannot lab replicate entire human culture science is however not defined by needs replicated control trials rcts are only one method available science if rcts are not available you have test theories models other ways which can be done it is just not as easy besides which rcts are controlled real world is often not so rcts cannot ever constitute all of empirics science is economics science what varoufakis gets correct is that lot of professional economists are fact not engaged any science this he would agree someone like steve keen who would also say mainstream neoclassical school of economics is not science what is it then answer is that it is mathematical theory if formulated consistently it violates common presumptions real world real people are not rational have poor capacity maximize their subjective utility utility as neoclassical must non-circularly define it when it is formulated idealized axioms neoclassicals want believe are true real world theory can fact become inconsistent neoclassical axioms imply there is no stable price vector${}^\\dagger$ so for these few other reasons neoclassical economics is fictional fantasy if consistent it is not applicable real world if inconsistent then it is invalid every possible world that is what you call diabolical piece of mathematics waste of human intellect like string theory that proves strings are inconsistent ${}^\\dagger$see john blatt dynamic economic systems definitions give formal semantics idea of definition is convey meaning but this is only possible if we are communicating some sentient conscious knower if not then we are just formalising our thinking for ourselves but that can be worthwhile thing do define what you mean make it record then you can have what wittgenstein thought impossible private language if someone uses different definition for word say money us then we have possibility of needless debate argument do not wish engage that sort of thing so if you are going communicate meaningfully us as mmt aware activists you will need either accept temporarily our definitions or lay-out your own beg us temporarily explore yours mmt we have simple enough definition of money money is iou of issuer whatever issuer promises redemption for iou dictates perhaps subjectively value of money what it is worth you how much effort you will be prepared obtain their iou notice no such thing as bank is yet mentioned money can indeed exist without banks but iou does require some sort of record keeper even if it is you keeping record your head real world these are normally banks or one of functions of banks we then have new term define for state currency or state money state currency is iou of state which for normative purposes mmt defines be tax credit that which is accepted as redemption for payment of tax liabilities state owes you redemption of one unit of tax liability when you receive their currency tokens this is one reason among others but primary reason why you accept states currency payments am not talking about psychologically why you accept dollars rather than gold or bitcoin most of you accept dollars because everyone else does so understand that you have know macroeconomics because there is no way as whole society will accept worthless bits of paper for payments system as whole knows something backs state currency as soon as they learn it is not gold stored fort knox they realize it is pure state power it is not by genial social agreement state can use gold as fig leaf of course hide naked reality of their fiat currency should they feel need do so mmter would not need them too enjoying full naked splendour bloody perverts phrase money is ambiguous since it can refer tokens or account records or units of records unit of account provided you appreciate there is this ambiguity we will allow you talk us using word money if it is clear enough from context which meaning you are employing few other definitions axioms simple postulates that we agree need not be proven which will not belabour by writing them all down see theory mmt can now claim few corollaries one is that it now matters great deal whether you can get tax credits only from government or only from private banks or both because bankers can be tiny little assholes about their tightness on credit why because governments deem them insolvent if they cannot cover their liabilities how frickin dare that government encroach upon beautiful efficiency of private sector all going making currency valuable all it matters also because if governments allow themselves emit their own tax credits then demos has some measure of protection from predatory bankers also government itself is now not beholden pecuniary interests of private bankers it seems me this is sociologically extremely important note positive money activists why would government \u0026mdash as governors \u0026mdash refuse allow themselves ability issue their own tax credits why am even bothering ask question mmt is thus not merely accounting money story which is political story makes huge f-ing difference if you get it wrong you can get mired austerity politics all sorts of other abuses crimes against humanity allowing involuntary unemployment all for no good reason but ignorance can give you warren moslers pithy summary of money treasury bond price stories all nutshell which is as succinct statement that can find pointing out mmt is much more than mere accounting warren wrote its mmt recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof see implications are truly profound you only need dip your toe mmt literature then you will see there is whole lot of depth that pool you cannot grok it all day just at least take look at mosler\u0026#39s proposals here for starters what about bank money lets see banks issue credit which is your promise repay not banks bank allows you create your own official iou amazingly you can pay your tax liabilities it even better some idiot down road running grocery store will accept this give you groceries for it arent banks marvellous also unit is state currency which means what bank issues is always iou of state we are not talking about corporate paper here either but even that is also denominated states unit of account dollar yen euro so banks are offering you yom \u0026mdash you owe me which is functionally just inverse of iou how heck can they do this it is because they are licenced use states unit of account so when you take bank credit now being debt bank you are nonetheless credit government who will always accept your currency receipt of tax payment this is why you can always use your bank money purchase goods why else do you take on debt bank seller will take your filthy bank money because them it is functionally exactly same as clean green government issued currency they may indeed pay off their tax liabilities fraction of your purchase problem here is commercial banking system private banks are not currency monopoly so you can certainly pay off your tax liabilities but then you still owe bank or theyll take your house off you or whatever you implicitly or explicitly offered as collateral but why why can bank not pay itself do really have say why they are licenced regulated by state anyone heard of jail for fraud laws anyone so this is very different states currency operations but it is using same unit of currency bank cannot operate without government around impose liabilities that by force drive demand for otherwise worthless state currency they can then issue their yoms but only because state permits this now some mmters say this means private banks are acting as agents of state this is true but it is only definition of what it means be one type of agent people get all uptight lose their marbles over this but it is just definition if you do not like saying banks are agents of state then call them something else it does not change reality of monetary system operations banks cannot function by issuing their own money if they try issue iou theyll pretty soon run out of takers try it yourself \u0026mdash is possible taunt every cryptocurrency nutter ever tragedy of that is that cryptocurrency early adopters did make billions all at expense of late-comers it continues be bit of tragedy like going casino tax on stupidity but big gain for borderline criminals modern day charles ponzis reason why banks are not running ponzi schemes aside from fraudulent bankers is because they are government regulated they must satisfy solvency capital requirements or state shuts them down this is very strongly enforced one thing governments are finicky about enforcing as counterfeit if state loses this power then its currency demand drops zero but then so will banks why people troll mmt \u0026mdash positive money all that one reason we find lot of trolls making rude or obnoxious comments on mmt related content on social media is because they are using different semantics different definitions if you define money as account records emitted by private banks only by private banks then it is debateable whether this can be considered state currency however if state accepts bank created records as redemption for tax liabilities then state is cooperation private banks making it be so by law that bank credit is state currency or state might say you need units of bank credit redeem one unit of their tax liabilities they usually do not but they could that would then be dual money system but trivially so conversion factor you could very well just assume you have pay double tax you used denominated private money tokens total bananas but guess pigs could grab jet packs fly trolling over definitions people troll mmt because they think their definition is one only true definition it is bit infantile because definitions only matter when they are employed theorize or model so if you can come up model where dominant monetary form region is bank credit issued only by private banks governments are only getting on action by imposing tax liabilities denominated bank currencies then you have some grounds argue against mmt theory mmt says state currency is unit of account of state created by law of land not by banks banks can however obtain licences operate credit facilities from state this is fact objectively true if one examines law any nation that has state currency driven by taxation banking payments system it is not only by law either old fashioned ledger books conformed today software systems banks use have be licenced they implement mmt operations pure simple this can be empirically tested it has been so now we have opportunity for departures theories based upon definitions we can ask do governments need borrow credit from banks which they have repay interest order get state currency into government account books why do banks allow government vote issue more of banks currency or rather why does government army police force permit private weakling banks dictate credit supply even pose these questions is conceding principle these are not applicable questions you can ask them but answers are trivial answers are that governments never borrow from banks governments never take orders from banks it is other way around but if you want appear insane test your sanity we can examine software accounting law practices check see if you are posing sensible question you will find you are not governments of any reasonable sized population define their currency permit banks operate as private payments deposit holding services like our bus system wellington new zealand which is publicly licenced but privately run for profit \u0026mdash they could not operate without our city councils approval philosophically is private public service provider really private sector or are they really public sector answer is it depends upon your definitions so do not be nerd if someone says otherwise what you think here one definition public service contractors are private sector when they clock off work public sector when they are on job if government is contracting them this might not be your definition see if it matters you have check what is legally enforceable what workers rights do contractors have are they civil service protections or private sector wild west notice we have already crossed over into mmt land because we are talking about account records not gold governments most of them anyway have no interest anymore gold fort knox usa viewed as backing for us dollar is charade it is store of gold that might be used for future space travel optoelectronics but that is all these days it never gets shipped around any significant amounts back any payments system this signed by law 1930s when usa stopped redeeming for gold domestically then again 1972 when usa stopped charade of bretton-woods quasi gold standard but really based on us dollar but usa technically still promising redemption gold up until 1972 no longer. will concede ground our frenemy rob on comments sections${}^\\ddagger$ that gold is moved around how about that people do elevator it up out of fort knox back down hole ground moscow why if it is not for electrical engineering or high-end consumer electronics factory ${}^\\ddagger$i do not want slander real rob so hereby make strawman rob who will name niels rob or niels bor danish or niels bohr he takes copenhagen interpretation of quantum currency its gold am einstein taking realist account of state currency tax credit notice we are already stupid both since we have different definitions but idea is determine if there are real world consequences that can be tested like epr experiment bohr is considered have won this debate ok rob apologies physicists who would recognize have einstein bohr backwards this analogy credit is entangled debt gold cannot be entangled but read my t4gu pages see why einstein knew about entanglement better than bohr ultimate end er=epr my dudes partly rubes need this charade that something physical real stuff man backs currency you know otherwise they might not find someone willing purchase their wares someones promising gold for redemption right satisfying rubes is time-honoured tradition it is unknown whether putin understood any of this he might be one of those rubes thinking moscow better stick gold under ground or rouble might collapse permafrost you see any case gold bullion does get shipped around from time-to-time keep these rubes sleeping at night mean horror what if people lost all credit records havent you seen mr robot you cant be giga-chad if you do not own gold my dudes ultimately though there could be method putins madness if you have some idea gold price is going go up dollar units you can meddle your foreign exchange rate by selling gold you bought cheaper your currency yen euro rouble again can give some battle ground niels bohr here if russia desires fixed exchange rate thereby signal they want help their export oligarchs screw their domestic workers over than theyll try maintain some foreign exchange rate target they decide is satisfactory for exporters this will not help them win military conflict however so really do not know what putin is thinking he has workers energy steel they can make bullets why do they give toss about forex rate they could be rubes or they could think this is form of psychological warfare because foreign state officials also believe gold is currency rather than buffer stock who knows it is possible some utter catastrophe could destroy all branches of us government then irs might stop functioning demand for usd collapse zero water or coffee beans or gold might become medium of exchange for while until new government tax authority enforcement is formed before then fort knox might get raided whoever raids most might find themselves as new monopoly issuer of private currency records that it promises redeem for gold adults not being adults making misery for masses love or love laugh at pedants who say this is why mmt is null when exactly do they think usa will collapse sure it could happen but until it does us dollar system is well-described by mmt same here new zealand for nzd mean seriously when aussies run out of fertile soil desalinated water we will fight on beaches trolling over positive money class positive money cranks as different sort of troll they tend have their hearts right place but their conceptions of money are so poor they can be hazard public good consciousness but here have create strawman because have failed meet positive money theorist wild had one roped online for day but they gave up on me gave up on me hell must be non-redeemable cult however am prepared build this strawman out of wikipedia this one is for uk but substitute bank of england for any central bank you get positive money for any country positive moneys historical backbone proposal is introduce sovereign money system under such reform private banks would be deprived from their ability create money by extending credit into economy turn bank of england would regain monopoly over money creation by financing governments budget monetary financing or distributing citizens dividend helicopter money group however refutes any affiliation modern monetary theory \u0026mdash downloaded 2023-01-02 they are right refute affiliation mmt because mmt would say lol uk already have sovereign currency they just do not know it act like they do not have boe created money it is fair think say uk monetary system looks like private bank mafiosi but appearances are deceptive it is bankers mafia only because government wants it be why does any foreign power accept libor warren moslers suggestion steer fifth fleet up thames tell them what interest rate will be all private banks uk have all obtained their ukp equity from past uk government deficits so money all came from uk government it never silver or gold political issue positive money activists have correct is that uk monetary system is heavily influenced by private banks their credit creation authority that authority comes from uk government not private bank cartel but this is only legal business it is uk government permitting all these bank credit facilities be operated on uk soil we are not talking about shadow banking here which may also not be sufficiently regulated but whatever shadow banking is it is not credit creation it is strictly loaning deposits which is not bank credit creation thus if positive money activists are only arguing that uk government should better assert its actual existing power as currency monopolist help stop lower income people from going into bank debt then they can be affiliated mmt because all mmt aware people know would agree that is objective of all enlightened current activism over injustices of banking system but you have then also understand mmt job guarantee truly see proper fix for base problem unfortunately strawman positive money activists go overboard conspiracy story${}^\\ast$ also fail understand that there is always debtor whenever there is creditor so positive money is fiction you cannot create positive money it is inapplicable notion because all money is iou of issuer otherwise it is not money issuer has debt obligation promise redeem receiver has credit ${}^\\ast$ do not quite see how government that wants empower private banks credit creation rather than government issue is conspiracy it is at least conspiracy conducted broad daylight crime against humanity am possibly even more insistent it is human rights crime than positive money people \u0026mdash because know government does not need any new laws stop banker mafia if you cannot see broad daylight how am aid you if there is no promise redeem you have not got currency you have ponzi scheme like bitcoin giving back bank of england monopoly lol mmt law scholarship \u0026mdash integral part of mmt reveals central banks are already branches of government governments are already currency monopolists they regulate private banks they just need do it better so people need are never debt job guarantee policy no private bank ever should have seat at jg policy table private bankers interest is getting people into debt that serves no public purpose unless firm wants be debt expand their green sustainable business \u0026mdash should be rule here positive money people would agree hooray somehow positive money theorists got spurious idea their heads that governments are beholden private banks perhaps that is due perverse way government treasury departments play smoke mirrors conceal fact that on balance sheets they are already creating currency every time they spend no private bank sight but usa at least they put private bank bond dealer middle of road as fake this is truly how money creation by government is run it is charade government is currency sovereign already we know reasons for this too it is ideological neoliberals conservatives can never countenance thought government issues currency by marking-up bank accounts they want rich people be privileged tax-payer funded myth see raúl carrillos superb piece here or youtube discussion here be fair it easy write spurious notion that governments are beholden private banks into your head \u0026mdash simply read orthodox economics textbook fake knowledge yet how currency operations are abused matters doubt governments wanting abuse monetary system would ever dream of voting positive money proposals this is same criticism mmt enjoys \u0026mdash even if mmt describes system well who is there force governments run job guarantee lower interest rates zero no neoliberal know of for damn sure if we thus want bank of england use monopoly power it already has conjunction uk parliament we have use force of democracy educated population presently that means understanding mmt you can also take look at positive money proposals see which seem reasonable but they do not describe fair use of current monetary system that is why they are reforms but they need no change existing monetary system proposals more targeted public investments better accountability eliminate fraudulent lending green economy fiscal targetting tax polluters invest sustainable firms digital cash are all fine have no issue them but where heck is guarantee of employment for anyone seeking positive money what is pm buffer stock sparkling mineral water but it does me no good eyes of positive money activist tell them these policies could already be implemented any way you look at it if votes parliament are there twill be done there is no need hinder those votes by also asking for other crankery monetary reforms that try turn money into something positive when money is always everywhere has been for over 5000 years record of credits debits do wonder if positive money people realize their system would still be tax-driven so their money would still be tax credit so their money would still be iou of state debt of state negative on treasury balance sheet or for you me overdraft oh dear integers bridging semantic gap there might be some semantics issues that can help overcome argy-bargies between mmt activists positive money activists could we first establish definition credit $-$debt money credit money is claim on real resources you can pass it on exchange someone who desires be credit then we can ask what positive money people think defines money their positive bank reserves facilitate payments but still bit of charade this might be hard gain agreement upon but banking software is where we can go see banks never lend their reserves \u0026mdash even if they think they do software wont let them failing inspecting software some countries like new zealand usa permit freedom of information act requests foia we could use few of those yah getting positive money activist on-board can take while brief there is no need for fractional reserve banking${}^\\s$ there is need for accurate accounting which is already performed so that only leaves need understand monetary system stop it from being abused it is being abused using unemployed buffer stock of human labour is human rights crime by any fair account of matter if not abused it does not need reform managers of system are ones needing reform if we do positive money reforms whats stop banking mafia from just getting government give them other ways screw over workers so lets focus on real issue which is proper just governance of existing monetary system it is fit for purpose people presently running governments are not but we can help educate them so they are or next generation at least this will likely shut down our current dougbot project requiring reboot since wed be new regime but will not be complaining ${}^\\s$ fractional reserve banking is artificial self-imposed constraint on credit also known as artificial austerity if positive money people have defence avoid needless austerity then why extra complication rules that requires resources enforce will admit am bit vague on why some of positive money people want fractional reserve banking be thing caveats steve keen defines credit as rate of change of debt cannot honetsly tell if this is standard usage it seems economists lack some standards if credit on fred h.8 tables is amount of credit isssued over year by banks then thats flow not stock it is stock of money from bank credit divided by $1$year that agrees prof keen however as outsider econ academia find this terribly confusing what we should be talking about is opposite sides of balance sheet or godley table entity $a$ has rising credit equals entity $b$ having rising debt not just debt but macroeconomics debt is stock government debt accumulates year on year it is government deficit that is flow $\\delta$debt$ \\delta t$ $\\delta $1\\$year when bank debits account it always credits another by same amount no rate time is involved is have state notes then have tax credit not flow of anything like wage wages are rates of change of my tax credits $\\delta$credit$ \\delta t$ interest rate time span of credit factors time dimension you have return credit after some time but this case debt should also be flow too not stock if you want be consistent having \u0026lsquocredit be rate of change of anothers debt would then conflict what believe is standard semantics for government sector government deficit or surplus is flow government debt is accumulated deficit over all time stock all outstanding tax credits mmt usage this is just my vote credit $=$ $-$debt $\\delta$credit $-\\delta$ debt rate of change of debt is deficit when positive is surplus =rate of change of net credit time period is usually taken as one year so sort it out you econ nerds geesh what is writing iso standard document too beneath your poncy assets next

particular stock prices or even sectors we are interested main aggregated market indices usa spx nasdaq whatever this is partly pragmatic if you liken economic system weather climate climate is very predictable highly macro weather is not too micro whenever you see such qualitative level distinctions you know you are dealing dynamical system so-called emergent properties top-down causations purely bottom-up system that admits reductionistic description can always be modelled using micro-casual analysis \u0026mdash enough compute power genuine top-down controlled system does not admit such analysis but most dynamical systems are not entirely top-down economy of large nation is such hybrid system it has micro-causal macro-causal responses feedbacks so also involves potential for useful mesoscopic analysis for philosophers genuine top-down causation is impossible classical physics so is considered impossible economics because economic system is considered not be sensitive quantum mechanics but this is incredibly naïve foolish there is stupid dumb way you can see it is foolish at very basic level because all computers running modern fintec systems nanosecond trading algorithms absolutely must rely upon quantum mechanics because their transistors cannot function otherwise but this is stupid because transistors are mere means classical end computation on traders desktop is turing machine process even sub-turing because it lacks infinite memory tape so all that is totally classical physics input into economic system so where is top-down economics you do not have believe roger penrose think quantum mechanics pays role human thinking processes but you should understand human consciousness is not explained by physics inner subjective phenomenal qualia so no matter what source of human consciousness is we do not really care for present purposes whatever it is it is not physics so human psychology is not driven by bottom-up blind physical events you will need read my other website t4g theory see one set of reasons why or just trust me human beings making good bad lame chad decisions are top-down influences on economics bottom-up signals as other inputs generalized forces one question one might naïvely ask is what are generalized forces economic system that move prices six billion dollar question most analysts give up use brute raw statistical probability theory analysis which is admitting you have no idea about forces you only know distributions of outcomes which think is fair approach even state-of-the-art dynamical systems models ann artificial neural networks thing is no dynamical system model can do better prediction or modelling job than accuracy of your modelling assumptions permits no ann can do better prediction or modelling job than data it gets trained on can admit this is because all real anns are finite state machines so they lack conscious thought so lack genuine creative insight capacity so cannot generate more than what information theory la shannon can be found their inputs this is all so unless you subscribe radical panpsychism anyhow this is big issue for our effort over at dougbot project because what argue douglas is that we are automating his canniness not creating new thinking being that can oracle stock prices pragmatic terms this does not really effect our research because research team needs push pull but for you philosophers of finance this might be of interest also if you are investor who has come across some wild good claims about how genius has found way beat markets earn you insane returns did someone just say carlo pietro giovanni guglielmo tebaldo ponzi rather than looking for oracle powers idea method for dougbot is use hybrid techniques simplest is use dynamical system model of steve keen goodwin-minsky variety get very high level macro dynamics correct dude portugal did this for portuguese economy pedro sousa you can get his phd paper here being eu this thesis not trivial bank flows had be carefully analysed sousa did excellent job such models are not going say squat about stock prices but they might have useful information for informing us about macro aggregates like s\u0026ampp500 or nasdaq or new zealand npx trouble is macroeconomic models deal fiscal flow or godley tables there is no real generalized force them for seeing how relative prices move because complexity available currently these minsky models there is only one price level or two if you are clever asset prices call them fictional goods can be partially de-coupled from goods prices real goods being physical things people consume not numbers on bits of paper all forces most of keen-minsky models can currently build are behavioural equations such as phillips curve rest is just stock-flow consistency mere accounting your nation does have have fair justice system have accounting rules satisfied reality though it is not trivial imagine rampant counterfeit imagine rampant bank fraud such deviant illegal behaviour would invalidate minksy-keen model unless we accounted for it \u0026mdash black market ops counterfeit rows godley tables for most part we hope be able ignore such factors here have conjecture get wild insane returns like one particular fund claims you need be dealing black market or something illegal drug dealers traffickers will be prepared make insane losses due nature of their business they can still eat caviar but their loss is someone elses gain so black ops hedge fund bet investor who is extremely diversified this leaves us generalized forces driving relative absolute price movements that will need be empirically determined that is hard task but some physics principles can help us how can you measure force if something is moving you can measure force by measuring acceleration but thats only provided there is single force which is not case general multiple forces can cancel whenever there are pushes pulls then this manifests as type of stress however it is still always true that any net force will be manifested as acceleration thats what one worries about for price movements net force we can do this for lot of fiscal flow data published by fred bis good early news is that we can see hints of causal relations from looking at accelerations lagged margin debt spx this is promising because although there is still lot of noise we can see generalized force acting conceptual idea of movements incomes wages other macroeconomics variables can be illustrated diagram here physics concept of energy needs be replaced economics by something like optimal output such as productivity or real output so on one side theres too little starvation on other side too much resource depletion illustration is only showing one-dimension real world there will be multiple dimensions so instead of curve wed actually have ball system of interest firm household sector commodity or any sub-system of economy you are interested that causes changes $y$ objective function general point is that viewed this way only as metaphor there are forces at work macroeconomics on right diagram interest rate is shown as repeller force if you are middle income at top of energy curve you are maybe safe but unstable getting poor or rich since interest rate hikes hurt poor reward rich it is force that creates growing wealth divide deceptive thing about simple diagrams like is-lm models is that they are not showing full manifold of all effective objective functions happiness social unrest peace optimal food output optimal savings \u0026ampc on right diagram drew curve going back upwards at higher wealth levels which for instance might be due third dimension manifold not visible that effects $y$ when too many rich people exist you can imagine several such factors from too many idle people lowering optimal useful output social unrest lowering unit worker productivity will maybe re-use these metaphors further discussion because although theyre not quantitative they are useful for illustrating conceptual idea that are very important macroeconomics id summarize this as going beyond stupid equilibrium supply\u0026ndashdemand curves its high-dimensional manifold problem is economic system has many people their feet on gas peddles brakes all over place we are looking at superposition of them all aggregate so it is always going be noisy conjecture our research is based upon is that some of this will be gaussian noise if it is then we are not dealing power law dynamics not fat tails signals this is vital for getting well-trained neural nets anns do not like noise it is best think of ann as merely canning your reasoning capacity when comatose or dead drunk it is going be feeble but you can make out numbers letters maybe stop versus go signs what if forces are static stress am not sure economics has this concept but consumer sentiment is possibly qualitative form of data we might be able use but at this stage it would be sketchy it is something stock brokers finance journalist use debt-to-gdp is stock divided by flow stocks are lot like static forces you can measure their velocity acceleration get flow variable but if you can also find force signal stock then that is acting like stress good example of this is major example great crash of 1929 gfc of 2007-8 both had private debt excess of 150% of gdp this stress variable its rate of change over 10% that velocity measure so rate of change of acceleration indicating underlying force both stress velocity seem be triggers neither separately this is from empirical work by richard vague see brief history of doom although if am right there should have been impulse triggered great crash that would be short burst accelerator if recall from reading galbraith great crash 1929 force mostly psychological boundless hope optimism 2007-8 force emergence of just few short traders they pushed subprime mortgage market off knife-edge balance of wild optimism real estate cdos mbss but it is always more complicated rumour gossip wild optimism yields neurosis \u0026ampc it is hard gauge these forces but time series accelerations forces produce are always visible should have more write about this coming months we are trying find dominant accelerators guess it is also worth mentioning wall street quants probably know accelerators they just do not make that knowledge public so we have do this work for our community of followers forces from ledger books godley tables explained here by ty keynes do not model generalized economic forces per se they model accounting rules flows are determined by behavioural equations that relate stock variables minsky-keen models for example phillips curve for wage rate as function of employment price level behavioral function here $ft$ $$ \\frac{dx_i}{dt} ft x_1 x_2 \\ldots $$ is like generalized force but if dependent variable $x_i$ here is not price then it is not so useful for dougbot price might however be sensitive $x_i$ which would be useful know also wed need $x_i$ itself be flow not stock that is because rate of change $dx dt$ is velocity not acceleration if $x_i$ stock then $ft$ would be velocity e.g how fast cash is turning over if we only look at velocities we would not have causal model get cause we need force forces are drivers velocities are effects of drivers stocks are lowest downstream effects where things end up after given time period need write caveat all this is largely metaphorical outside steve keens work no one really understands financial system force-like terms it is all energy-like \u0026mdash thermodynamic equilibrium \u0026mdash if you wanted physics analogy which is all wrong-headed neoclassical thinking btw reason steve keen says his minksy dynsys models prove mmt is because he says mmt is just accounting this is pretty awful of steve but he can be forgiven we mmt enthusiasts would say mmt is lot more than accounting it is about societies legal financial institutional arrangements much more than just accounting rules however part steve keen is right about use of godley tables because of these legal rules old days it used be ledger books money created by fountain pen youd have hard time back then doing real-time forecasting financial time series published these days amateur computer programmer can probably see near real time velocities accelerators financial data interest rate repeller other social forces there is of course lot more mmt analysis its implications for system dynamics stock prices move by one type of set of forces but wages by others often activists are more interested wage consumer price goods price movements could give fig about stock price movements these cannot all be completely de-coupled because of fiscal constraints embedded banking system government has freedom set absolute price level what appears keen-goodwin-minsky model but not all relative prices unless they are totalitarian government which we have never really perfectly seen on earth just approximations one reason steve keen tarnishes his reputation by abusing mmt community as nothing but accountants is because it matters politically whether people understand mmt system use it wisely that has been point of mmt social movement for over 30 years as of date from founding by warren mosler bill mitchell randall wray joined by stephanie kelton pavlina tcherneva matt forstadter scott fulwiler now legions of others particular what steve keen has never acknowledged correctly afaik is insight of bill mitchell on buffer stocks that mmt system which is currently operational reality most nations world uses labour buffer this is vital mmt understanding without it you get idiots like steve keen can say this since he is good internet friend aussie so he knows am just blowing hot air but only half-joking claiming mmt is nothing but accounting say steve that labour buffer is not accounting it is matter of grave social justice or injustice depending on how people understand buffer also think steve keen is very old school on treasury bonds story warren mosler had insight no one else agreed him at time that when fed sells treasury bonds for monetary operations it functionally same as treasury selling bonds for fiscal operations he realized you cannot call them different functions still this day most post-keynesians disagree this is not mere accounting squabble people agree about software operations think it is government function insight fed cannot be thought of as private entity independent of us government if you still think otherwise you are not mmt aware thing is it makes huge difference political economy so is far far beyond impact of just accounting it can ruin peoples lives always those who lives are already most miserable by pushing austerity politics using interest rate repeller among other injustices would also claim that warren mosler best understood impact of moving floating exchange rate fiscal space this freed up for government post-keynesians generally not all still do not comprehend this steve keen seems still be one of them most post-keynesian think exchange rate is exogenous constraint mmt says it is not not if you understand correct actual software-driven legally instituted monetary operations available governments but this includes legal let me say it again legal arrangements mmt says these matter over above accounting principles this is vital for understanding why no fit currency issuing government has any foreign exchange constraint they do if they make up one only mosler 1995 understood this most post-keynesians still do not hence we have stupid debates about trade policy exports as cost imports as benefit mmt story which is correct exports are price you pay for your imports this is not neoclassical thinking as steve keen slurs mmt community it is just logic but logic can cause suffering for poorer nations if people do not understand it like logic of what happens when you ignore momentum walk into street lamp poles lastly for today will mention two key conditional fundamentals that post-keynesians do not seem understand or know deposit holders know crap all about their bank so liability side of banking is not place for market discipline central bank policy levers are about prices interest rates not quantities why are these conditional fundamentals it is because they apply when nation uses tax credit which is non-convertible currency on floating exchange rate without those conditions central bank has employ methods like bond issuance control interest rates control weakly exchange rates they furthermore will want deliberately cause mass unemployment limit inflation like psychopaths who have broad public approval for their ax murdering floating exchange rates there is no need for those functions above two fundamentals apply on fundamental mosler writes even wall street analysts cant reliably do this assess bank insolvency risk also thought it worth quoting rest of warrens paragraph on banking proposals for helping smaller banks regulation supervision on asset side then became imperative while we have seen periodic failures due lax regulation supervision of asset side of us banking system its work progress alternative of using liability side of banking for market discipline exposes real economy far more disruptions far more destructive systemic risk you cannot get more mmt than this if you do not understand monetary operations you will introduce instability inequality what ticked me off about steves flippant comments that it is not only warren who has been preaching truth for years steve keens acquaintance charles goodhart has too as warren relates fairly blisteringly true might add those who understand reserve accounting monetary operations including those directly involved monetary operations at worlds central banks have known for decades that banking causation runs from loans deposits reserve requirements if any being merely \u0026lsquoresidual overdraft at central bank not control variable this includes professor charles goodhart at bank of england who has written extensively on this subject for roughly half century endlessly debating \u0026lsquomonetarist academic economists who spew gold standard fixed exchange rate rhetoric who are unaware of how monetary operations are altered when there is no legal convertibility of currency once steve acknowledges all this other generalized forces mmt social movement he will apologise us he is good guy mean really good nice guy salt of earth bit of fire cracker his hand too though also am pretty sure he is trolling us when he says mmt is just accounting so took bait also he said that at mmt conference so of course he having aussie lark but he can also be damaging mmt movement when he says such things more publicly because they are wrong this matters because steve is very influential economist activist note self need write theory section on trade when we write about trade important thing is not be too simplistic naïve word seem need use lot fadhel kaboub jan kregel are mmt aware have decent body of work on international trade exchange rate is not their problem biggest problems by far are imperial power abuses neocolonialism just broadly war injustice dysfunctional justice systems weaker nations fixing up their exchange rate is pretty much negligible help all that but they need mmt lens know what do about it when they restore civil society australia will never have foreign exchange constraint because their government know how tell foreign buyers of their land politicians piss off \u0026mdash at least if they want too if they do not want well then their civilized bbqs shrimp could turn into charcoaled gruel purchased at tesco lotus shop even more generally we are dougbot project using mmt understanding lens do finer grain price analysis it is not merely accounting although we could call it post-keynesian or institutionalist mmt is superset of these schools not subset anyone thinking otherwise is just being very nasty founders of movement like mosler mitchell randall wray is better arbiter since he post-keynesian still is he considers himself now mmt thought not that any of these labels names matter but funnily economics profession they seem like they do not physics or

commenting on highlights from perry mehrlings mooc on money banking online from inet today its comment on when mehrling starts out by alerting his students that he is going talk about ecb as if it private entity then only later lectures talk about money as creation of state thought this is completely wrong emphasis euro is mmt system but very weirdly structured so as look function like private or endogenous currency system but that is one of veils of money it is easy make state currency system mmt look like private currency just listen all lunatics who claim us fed is private bank they obviously all believe us dollar is created by fed not by congress they are complete nutters but it is easy forgive them because congress also acts like fed is hands-off private entity so it is little unfair blame nutters for their warped views those power controlling usa mmt system share lot of those warped views what is weird here is that usa at least some of eu nutters also tend hate government yet are following government narrative however this weirdness can be explained those same nutters are often ones getting elected into government yeah people who hate government are running governments why not from their perspective best way destroy something truly well is often from inside this is why we gotta stop electing them if enough people playing baseball game think it is cricket what you will observe is cricket game played catching mitts awkwardly rounded bats you see duality what does not change are field mitts ball bats but what is weird is how people use that equipment result is terrible game of cricket or worse game of baseball one of those is analogous usa other eu perhaps am not sure which is more appropriate mapping but how is mehrling any different nutters think mehrling understands basics of mmt but if you do then think moral obligation is talk about true account of currency monopoly first which means state theory of money has go first because it is primary pedagogically order matters aside you can tell bad teachers from good ones by order which they teach topics ive had this physics best way teach quantum mechanics is tell truth first before mathematical formalism which is that we have no clue what ontological basis for quantum mechanics is so everything follow is pure descriptive formalism wavefunction is not ontology so dont try construct ontology based on properties of wavefunction even better physics teacher might add although we do not think wavefunction is ontology it could be ontology point is we do not know so do not second guess nature it is ok conjecture ontology then test it however ecb certainly does function lot like private currency endogenous money system but that is only because that is way governments seem wish it be here by governments we really mean those power those power europe are wannabe oligarchs so yeah they are highly prone abusing state currency system treating it like private currency system this is major source of mess euroland hierarchy of money here is relvant bit from lecture on this commented all well good treat ecb as bankers bank if indeed that is what it is but it is not it is creation of eu so is creation of governments problem being that is plural so only more powerful members of eu germany france belgium really have what is akin monopoly currency issuing capacity contrast usa where congress has all monopoly since they can fire fed board vote nuance that should be put up-front is that these governments are de facto owned by bankers oligarchs through distortion of democracy so legalistically mehrling is wrong claim central banks are private institutions but functionally he is kind of right but only because demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively want be beholden private oligarch interests most neolib politicians aspire be members of oligarchy ok but fact monetary system gets abused several ways makes mehrlings point about hierarchy of financial instruments reality seriously big f-ing problem for social stability we need like things production equivalences remain rough equivalences as trade parity principles predatory financial speculators merchants of financial ponzi schemes tariffs other banking corruptions mess this up one nations tariffs become anothers subsidies you cannot expect people who get squeezed by unfair prices not fight back if they are lucky their government will fight back for them guess be fair mehrling if aim is learn how think like central banker then he has fair point leading ecb as bankers bank what am saying is why would any student want learn how think like central banker first first is bias so first you want students think like expertly informed workers who understand mmt system understand abuse of it then later it is fine teach them how central bankers view system why central bankers are wrong credit is not money about minutes into lecture segment mehrling seems take pains claim money is not credit here he is just plain wrong at least language framing he starts one view of his hierarchy of money gold is ultimate money which is cringe gold has never been money gold standard is not regime where gold is money it is regime where temporarily as long as trust gold supply lasts government or other currency issuer promises redeem for gold when gold runs out or is known be running out they always get off gold standard until some later time when gold reserves are grabbed back it is charade no one ever uses gold for purchasing it is just place-holder just like grain weights of wheat corn or barley used ancient times they are just placeholders for currency unit people who are not fetishists do not want or need gold they want credits they need eat so they want bread not gold metal form of currency is irrelevant all money is i.o.u of issuer so all money is someones credit whoever receives iou all money is equally someones debt debt of issuer but you might think am being pedantic it almost too cringe listen rest of this lecture segment mehrling claims money is how credit is repaid true but that just means money is credit because single currency system all credits debits are same units it is all same money form what mehrling is getting at is subtler point which is that when you have positive digits your bank account or coins or notes your pocket then these are unique ious because they are only ious on earth that you can redeem for tax liability extinction that is why state money seems different bank credit but if they are denominated same units then there is no difference both forms are tax credits operationally legally difference is process of how you get them into your bank account or wallet but when government says by fiat that their tax credit redeems for gold they are not thereby making gold money they are making gold buffer stock do not think mehrling understands this but it is critical thing understand what else mehrling really means is that commercial bank credit endogenous money is not same as state currency exogenous money this is agreement mmt agreement all legal operational reality most nations outside those who use foreign currency as their tax credits difference of course is stark so am not being pedantic there are painful realities taking on bank debt you get credit initially along signing explicit or one-time credit card agreement repay then you spend or why else use credit card so your credit gets moved into someone elses bank account they are now credit bank you are debt equally at least until interest charges accrue but when interest charges accrue bank gains more credit upon you you gain more debt dollar for dollar so sure enough endogenously all credit is debt however it holds exogenous as well but entirely different way profoundly different consequences this is mmt account of state currency state issues their currency by fiat not by credit you do not really need pay it back however someone has pay some fraction of it back due imposed tax liabilities but these are generalized arrangements can be arranged so that poorest people need pay no tax return that is difference whether you are poor or rich if you receive bank debt you must repay or lose your house or file for bankruptcy but if you receive government currency you do not have repay \u0026mdash so for instance if you are unfortunately poor then someone else will have pay some fraction of states currency back state need repay governments currency is thus not because receiver public sector worker or welfare beneficiary or contractor has taken upon debt burden fact it is opposite government has debt burden it is only society as whole that has tax liability burden that is by design so that principle operation of fiat currency can work without poorest shouldering burden since taxation is what drives demand for state currency someone has have tax liability imposed upon them so more justly that should be those who accumulate most by failing spend circulate their income they aught bear most of tax return burden \u0026mdash if we have well designed system but once bank credit goes into someone elses wallet they cannot distinguish it from government currency because it is same unit kilogram is kilogram whether it is chicken being weighed or brick it is only macroeconomically that distinction between issuing operations gets fully noticed ratio of private debt government issue or ratio of private debt gdp if private debt is too much higher than government fiat issue is growing faster then we have severe recessionary bias totally needlessly also \u0026mdash maybe this is something mehrling gets wrong later on am not yet sure \u0026mdash bank credit money is only as demand as government fiat currency since government licences banks bank money any creditors is equivalent government issue since this currency unit is same unit when say as demand as mean generally macro obviously people would prefer being given currency for selling goods or their labour time rather than having take bank credit themselves so it is not bank credit that is just as much demand it is currency freely floating that is demand once you get tax credit you dont care where it came from unless you are macroeconomist that is then you do care steve keens minksy models show you why you should care bank credit sources produce instability government issue does not however when chap like mehrling comes along says credit is not money he muddies waters it might even be poisoning well because if you see money as standalone thing that is no other entitys obligation or debt then you are both crazy privileging people who can mine that stuff out of ground or on computer or pirate stuff partly this is semantics but society semantics are incredibly important if we all have common misunderstanding that money equals some scarce stuff that everyone just agrees can settle payments then you are down cryptocurrency dead-end road allowing all sorts of scams frauds whereas if you take mmt semantics that all money is iou of issuer \u0026mdash promise redeem \u0026mdash then you have at least possibility of just society payments layer possibility because justice still needs be fought for protected mmt is only intellectual weapon that on-going spiritual war or jihad why say semantics matters is because it makes difference you can easily pirate gold or crytocurrency latter is called cracking not hacking or software back-door but you cannot pirate records on secured public ledger at least not very easily you have own ledger private bank deposit accounts are extremely secure most nations extent they are insecure they become pirate-able people are tight-assed about their bank accounts will soon let police or serious fraud office know if their account gets tampered extent bankers are at bare minimum trusted at least not fiddle too much numbers your bank account then banking system prevents piracy history shows empirically it works it just works except when thieves own banks 2008 gfc style read william blacks book \u0026#39the best way rob bank is own one\u0026#39 but even lead-up 2008 gfc no bankers fiddling numbers your bank account they do not need they need fiddle numbers their own bank account mark them ones up my dudes admit this matters if done on large scale because ratio of bank account numbers is what matters for social equity justice if million bankers can just mark-up their accounts by ten times that of everyone else using keyboard they gain relatively more purchasing power regardless of what stuff you think money happens be fool it is social consequences of which issuer you get currency from that matters it is better get it as creditor work for government or sell someone rather than as debtor you ideally at macro level want government be principle debtor because they cannot run out of their won currency this is thinking behind positive money movement which unfortunately also suffers from insanity so should write about that some time next post capitalism reality previous post veils of money back blog

some theoretical philosophical some practical real started writing this essay after friend douglas mmt trader suggested listen perry mehrlings lectures on money banking which cover as reading material collected works of allyn young after only short browse through mehrlings book on collected works of allyn young discovered few interesting things related mmt that thought worth blogging about wanted write them down before finishing lectures book see if get my mind changed which is always aim of all my study exciting when it happens am going write ahistorically here because do not yet know all of allyn youngs work so me he is fictional character that am using as avatar write about role of money macroeconomic system money growth one of major themes of allyn youngs thought his contribution economics professions understanding of how monetary systems are not mere veil over barter that rather monetary operations institutions are critical for helping hindering real economic growth prosperity so far this aligns mmt thought but young also seemed implicitly understand that money forms not truly crucial thing that performance of monetary system only means end that end being fair just distribution of real output settlement of obligations other words this seems align somewhat neoclassical economics money is veil over barter story but only if by barter we generalize any trade goods or social currency of debts feuds other obligations which think helps make it crystal clear neoclassical \u0026lsquoadam smith barter story is both incomplete reactionary \u0026mdash because it either implies money is only about barter goods or generalized sense it implies people who have money are \u0026lsquosocial credit hence have rightfully by divine decree earned their position as if theft exploitation corruption piracy prevented by divine decree of invisible hand proper nuance is that mmt is correct neoclassicals are wrong way allyn young would have arrived at this conclusion is because he seemed understand imposition of two opposing social forces that monetary operations are crucial friction that if abused by rich powerful can be severe obstacles justice that money form itself can function far better than veil over barter because it can facilitate trade commerce clear implication is that role of currency monopolist is minimize maximize that is government should not that they do just that they should play role monetary economy by suppressing abuse of money form by most powerful facilitate trade so that money does become more of mere veil mmt think would agree by mmt would think mean all mmt aware scholars activists mmt system itself does not think so can not agree nor disagree anything but you see tension mmt emphasises role of money banking way that steve keen\u0026#39s goodwin-minsky models vividly describe dynamically against almost all neoclassical myths but realm of political economy mmt de-emphasises importance of holding currency unit when only when it comes government policy considerations when you are issuer of currency you do not need worry about running out of money you neither have money nor do not have money because you issuer money is unit of your system of accounts that is because currency is not physical thing not commodity it is system of records of credits debts state currency form is tax credit tax credit is idea system is idea each have physical manifestations but physical tokens forms are almost irrelevant \u0026mdash recall island tribe yap islanders who used huge stone boulders some of which remained sunk sea as their tokens private money forms are different they are not tax credits but they are still i.o.us of their issuers commonality shared by all forms of money is that they are records of credit debt other words i.o.us of their issuer also common is what currency issuers mostly worry about which is how drive demand for their otherwise worthless i.o.us naïve naturalists anarchists austrian schoolers neoclassicals do not want grapple this problem they try wish it away like tooth fairy but it is only major problem wannabe currency issuer faces warren mosler wrote about how this fundamental problem is solved 7dif first using case of family parents issue their i.o.u children redeem it for extra playtime or whatever earn parents credits by doing household chores our relation governments is very similar abstract sense of course lesson is that demand for money is driven some way by powerful force parents family government nation king kingdom who commands loyal army priests running temple authority community or council running commune allyn young had somewhat naïve understanding of these facts probably related overly biased view about what constitutes justified private property rights so like lot of economists who came out of anti-marxist classical schools he tends shy away from recognizing role of governments as currency monopolists curiously though most marxists also shy away from recognizing government as currency monopolist for opposite ideological reasons guess being on opposite sides of class war can make people equally delusional sad thing about that last parenthetical remark is that neither marxists nor anti-marxists need believe myth that money is private creation of banks it helps both their cases if they recognize mmt reality you will not win class war by relying upon myth because other side will always grab advantage by abandoning myth going reality-based war misunderstanding energy this is just side note but important one it perhaps concerns one other veil of money but am not sure can justify it just yet as due money veil but will be giving this some later thought one problem allyn young had can be found one of legacies of his work which is endogenous growth theory this idea mainstream economics is that growth of economy by implication prosperity is mainly determined by factors operating within economy is not overly dependent upon external factors this is laughable theory it is one of great embarrassments economics that so many economists take it seriously but we can understand easily why if we think all energy is free then for sure economy can operate fairly fine endogenously but as physiocrats quesnay today kate raworth steve keen many other ecological economists understand role of energy production cannot be ignored no economic system gets energy endogenously most of it comes from sun that is ricardo-smith-marx tradition of thinking of either land or labour as only source of surplus value is utterly bone-headed wrong caveat this is that if you are able factor out energy your models some way perhaps as one unique external factor then maybe you can do ok macroeconomic analysis using endogenous growth theory ideas but there is no way pure endogenous growth theory works it is joke furthermore youngs supposed big idea that contra-quesnay contra-smith contra-marx it is not land or labour that is source of value but rather trade so young as naïve as all rest albeit little more original youngs thesis on trade being real source of wealth is shall we say interesting it is nuanced position but trade is not possible without energy so physiocrats are still foundation of economics higher layers of analysis just ignore this never had worry until today when energy demands are out-stripping biospheres regenerative capacity meaning no trade is going help this apply youngs thinking however is not fruitless because trade intellectual ideas is what will ultimately avoid ecological catastrophe so am prepared give allyn young his due on getting something good thought-out that went more than little bit beyond mainstream economic narrow-minded thought could come back this later identify this as fifth veil of money \u0026mdash idea that money is so dominant commerce that sales drive profits is so critical capitalism that role of energy as one common dominant factor all production of any kind from socialist capitalist feudalist gets utterly ignored or is it better say taken for granted so much that it is invisible invisible perhaps all but oil cartels electricity suppliers this last point \u0026mdash that energy is well understood be kingpin commodity that rules them all \u0026mdash is so well understood it is perhaps taken for granted except during energy cartel price gouging event but because it is so well understood as dominant driver of global currency inflation events when no currency is safe unless their governments comprehend mmt${}^\\ast$ think academic economists ignore role of energy production focus excessively on price instead think this is big blind spot of mainstream economics ${}^\\ast$mmt has perhaps only proper understanding of how foreign nation can combat oil monopoly price fixing which is let inflation run until energy cartels give up any government running fiat currency can always re-gauge their currency get oil meantime invest substitutes this is relative price adjustment story not hyperinflation story unless governments make it inflation bogeyman story by buying oil they suffer pass-through inflation but thats irrelevant maintaining fair domestic distribution because that government just raises their minimum wage welfare support number of zeroes they add on their lowest denomination currency bills is just digits of information no gold is at stake no grandchildren will ever be held ransom all that matters is relative price not absolute value stamped on currency or bank accounts what then matters is how much work your nation needs do export goods pay for oil imports that is always relative value story not runaway inflation story what also matters is psychological pressures coming from inflation fear-mongering which is real problem that mmt cannot directly help you except inform you problem is only peoples imaginations${}^{\\dagger}$ which is not trivial help margaret thatcher had exactly this psychological problem when she complained price of milk twice that when she child somehow she did not comprehend wages had gone up more than double all without putting any gold or crown jewels at stake ${}^{\\dagger}$i think it is fair say only mmt people understand this however this is no inoculation against getting sh*t scared that saying this truth out loud can earn ridicule condemnation truth is not always easy tell can put proverbial fear of god into those who dare speak it used not be too much of problem when human energy use easily well within planetary ecosystem boundaries but today that is no longer case so modern economists post 1980 or thereabouts are morally obligated update all their models account for crucial role of energy production especially at macroeconomic level where up until today it has been almost totally ignored this wise do not fault allyn young since he writing time when planetary ecological stress boundaries not understood seemed invisible anyway am not going call blindness role of energy production one of veils of money but hushed whispers think it really is one of veils of money so would be fifth on my list only reason for whispering here is that am not exactly sure of true historical story of how energy got ignored if engineers physicists had been first economists not philosophers of politics morality then think energy would always have been critical economics but that just not way history unfolded first veil am not going say all this is some sort of metaphysical characterisation of various veils im just free-flow writing here this veil is first one pop out veil is way money is so heavily used commercial trade that true origins history gets obscured dominant use of money is thus veil over true history origins origins of money are well understood by archeologists anthropologists knapp mitchell-innes graeber hudson wray among others true history is that forms of temple emperor or state authority currency all arose from settlement of debts thus records of credit every debt had corresponding credit for sure double entry book-keeping much later invention but before book-keeping people held these records of obligations well enough their heads any record of such debt or credit is form of money highly abstract sense i.o.u material sense monetary units properly came into existence when grain weights of rice or barley or wheat used as artifice or stand-in for those records of course paper records that reliable could have been used before solving forgery problem of paper records discovered tally sticks pretty good currency records note that none of this implies currency unit always creation of government state which is narrow chartalism sometimes means of settlement of debts so currency as means of payment can be created outside of government perhaps by feudal lord oligarch religious temple or some other power or authority or collective mmt story of money is still chartalist but is generalized chartalism \u0026mdash which means it almost always practically takes some power or authority run currency unit payments system they have be either trusted feared or both on this topic margaret atwoods accounts payback debt shadow side of wealth give vivid history that would make any zeitgeist movement philes wet their pants zeitgeist movement folks are not all bad though their motives are all good helping hindering this duality mmt exists any institutionally arranged system it is almost tautology because unless something is deterministic machine designed built function perfectly then system it runs will have imperfections some may help bias outcomes good way some bad way for example some of us joke that dick cheney most accomplished mmt policy maker past 25 years mostly for bad john maynard keynes galbraith most accomplished mmt policy makers during world war ii galbraith post-war era mostly for good at least by account their sides won war extent that success had anything do moving private production into public sector for that period successful war time efforts are examples of where there is one type of veil of money partially lifted everyone works for war effort issuing enough currency is not even debated issuer always finds enough currency they do so either by suspending artifice of gold standard or they just implement pure fiat money operations without gold standard veil forever after gold standard is thus revealed by wars be veil there never really gold money currency is always tax credit issuer tells you what it is worth if they tell you it redeems for $\\pi 100$ ounces of gold then thats fiat price what it can purchase then depends upon relative price of gold other goods but who gets that purchasing power is still choice of currency issuer like control of nuclear power primitive fire powerful force or technology can always be used commit atrocities mmt is no exception but monetary system is ancient has existed for over 5000 years is often force for good when used wisely it is not free market or natural equilibrium that achieves good or terrible social outcomes it is our wilful design or negligence that another near tautology if pure free market ever exist it would be by human conscious willful design my thought on that is always that what most people desire is fair market not free market freedom implies all sorts of bad things through fallacies of composition everyone is free stand up seats at football game or opera but they dont they constrain themselves for \u0026lsquogreater good greater good hence constraint is really more freedom not less because we are now talking about different qualities of freedom all freedoms are not equal quality freedom absolutists are knuckleheads use technical term people will bitch moan at us yeah but who gets say what counts as quality freedom ideal answer is always demos current realpolitk answer is oligarchs point is it is encumbent upon collective demos crack realpolitik corral governments towards ideal do so by claiming back their government from oligarchs oligarchs do have ownership claims on todays governments but that is unjust claim all people must act destroy that illegitimate claim understanding mmt gives people clear understanding how \u0026mdash oligarchs do not control monetary system government does demos must therefore reclaim their government it does not rightfully belong oligarchs second veil second veil is gold standard idea that because you need some token make payment token or stuff it is made out of itself is somehow money as explained above gold standard does not make gold currency it makes gold buffer stock if issuer runs out of gold currency rapidly deflates since buffer stock becomes scarce it is insane unstable system all mainstream economists agree mmt that sustained moderate inflation is better than any deflation but especially better than bursts of deflation bank runs cross of gold artificial austerity all that third veil third veil of money is way idea occurs unthinking people that \u0026lsquohaving money is seen as prestige by default almost taken as implying person lots of money has earned it so is \u0026lsquogood person or has been \u0026lsquohard working sometimes this is true veils are like that they will often reveal true silhouette money as this veil obscures corruption greed obscures fact poorest people are not deserving of being poor only mmt recognizes why this is true because mmt understands source of all unemployment monetary economy \u0026mdash that source is not laziness or apathy mmt this fashion follows tradition of edwards deming who pointed out japanese management or any management experts who would listen that they should not punish lowest performing workers because no matter how perfect their production system all workers top notch talents there is always lowest performer be found being lowest performer given period thus means next nothing it is incontrovertible statistic system as whole has be judged not trivially existing least productive worker deming said that if you have poor performing worker who should on paper be ok worker something is more likely wrong system money institutions at governmental level only at governmental level mmt tells us our already existing monetary legal institutions make state currency units mere scorepoints \u0026mdash as far as government is concerned \u0026mdash so government policy maker their unit of account state currency but only their states currency is mere veil over business of banking commerce regulation but this is absolutely critical awareness too many people on both political left right fail see this dual aspect money specifically state currency not private money forms caricature political divides somewhat id say lefties see money as evil some sense but focus on power of money how this is unfairly distributed they fail recognise full mmt picture because they do not see that governments control state currency system so are not beholden collecting taxes off rich people there are many other ways governments can ensure that there is no undue wealth inequality society e.g prevent unbridled capital accumulation first place right-wingers see money as essential but only as veil over barter because they cannot bring themselves see any essential role for government private commerce they fail recognize full mmt picture because they do not understand what drives monetary numeraire on right-wingers for second we know that what drives demand for fiat currency is imposition of liabilities of some kind or another it has never been any other way throughout all history fact one pretty good definition of money is that money is i.o.u \u0026mdash promise of issuer redeem that is equivalent record of credit debt issuer is debt receiver credit when receiver of i.o.u returns it issuer debt is redeemed creditor is back zero credit right-wingers fail understand all past present monetary systems because they cannot wrap their heads around this definition of money most right-wingers money is some physical substance like gold so they hate this concept of fiat currency which is nothing but scorepoints on secured ledger books one can go ahead use concept of physical stuff like gold as money but then you have re-wire all your macroeconomic models my knowledge no one has ever successfully done this more critically practice no nation has ever implemented such commodity money system though many right-wingers seem think those systems have existed eras of feudal rule when empires had broken down it is true that at some times gold coins or other metals used as socially understood commodity currency but problem is that this relied upon mass social misconception metal coins always traded for goods according numeraire stamped on coins this never held equal trade value of actual metal which normally lot less than numeraire face value on coins \u0026mdash because otherwise people would quickly learn melt down coins often illegally sell them actually writing it that way am not sure if it is correct call it mass social misconception people living at time had understand system since they did not go around melting down metal coins yet there misconception at some point because most accounts eventually tell story that metal currency so digging it up out of ground or mining it banking often allow other philosophers activists have their own definitions so if right-winger comes along insists money is commodity like gold would normally if this mapped science problem let it go but we cannot let it go when it comes macroeconomics because it makes huge f-ing difference whether or not state currency units we get tax liabilities imposed upon us are real stuff or mere scorepoints you want it be scorepoints why because you do not want motivate pirates because you want regulator of this system be able actually implement some justice balance economy so that increasing returns wealth do not become automatic destabiliser because you want inequality wealth holdings be surmountable because you want way eliminate nominal poverty so you do not want their scorepoints be artificially limited imagine at football game your side scores try or touchdown win at final second scorekeeper sorry lads ive run out of points minute ago this is all critical for justice even right-wingers like justice so they aught want fiat currency system points on government scoreboard but sometimes there is just no getting through reactionary minds of conservatives who seem simply be genetically ill-disposed all forms of government encroachment upon private markets this is highly ironic because market goods for sale semblance of democratic state currency system does not exist without government force tax collector imposing return of liabilities trouble for right-wingers libertarians is that if state government does not exist you only get something worse which is landlord imposing their own private liabilities upon you give me half your grain sheep or ill burn your hut down fourth veil because money is seen as instrument of most powerful because having excess credit gives someone more purchasing power this store-of-value function of state currency is veil over proper role of ideal democratic state it is because people hate see leviathan exerting power over little people that big government big brother is seen as anathema this is however veil over reality that without government little people aka working class are even more entirely screwed it is better have monopoly currency issuer protecting working class than have peasants real workers fend for themselves some libertarian anarcho-capitalist fantasy world problem is our governments have never been protectors of working class all gains made by working class have been by collectivist approaches exerting influence upon governments at chagrin of people running government government is crucial institution for worker emancipation but workers cannot just sit back wait for their rights be granted human rights have be exerted have be fought for have be won on moral grounds well before they are won on material grounds way warren mosler has put this is that labour market is not fair game role of democratic government is balance that playing field workers need more protection than bosses when people adopt view that money should be private system they are placing this veil over rightful role of democratic government conclude think there are other veils of money but ill stop at these for now think they are most important veils understand next post money banking euroland previous post neural nets mmt back blog
