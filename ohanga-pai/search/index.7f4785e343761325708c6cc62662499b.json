prediction algorithm while no algorithms success as predictor is proof theory behind algorithm is true it is necessary condition for theory be true necessary but not sufficient douglas are happy for now show you few necessary conditions for mmt are true frustration this is still frustrating because macroeconomic level is where mmt makes its claims claims are good easy verify stock-flow

because traders dont have clue about mmt they are unhinged from reality of state currency monetary operations their mental model is basically neoclassical barter this means there is still work that

tend be oh but we are all about bottom-up which is fine for what it can get you but when dynamical system has strong top-down causation such as existence of monopolists single-suppliers single buyers bottom-up analysis is going miss lot predictors are not going be as good as those that are appropriately informed by macro analysis at present we do not know what macroeconomic mmt analysis can do for improving microeconomic predictors so this is not our active focus of research but it is fascinating area think about developing let us know if you think you have insight into how get such research going we suspect machine learning models neural nets particular will be good tools for doing first level analysis just see what causal relations might probabilistically be \u0026mdash between macro

theoretical philosophical some practical real started writing this essay after friend douglas mmt trader suggested listen perry mehrlings lectures on money banking which cover as reading material collected works of allyn young after only short browse through mehrlings book on collected works of allyn young discovered few interesting things related mmt that thought worth blogging about wanted write them down before finishing lectures book see if get my mind changed which is always aim of all my study exciting when it happens am going write ahistorically here because do not yet know all of allyn youngs work so me he is fictional character that am using as avatar write about role of money macroeconomic system money growth one of major themes of allyn youngs thought his contribution economics professions understanding of how monetary systems are not mere veil over barter that rather monetary operations institutions are critical for helping hindering real economic growth prosperity so far this aligns mmt thought but young also seemed implicitly understand that money forms not truly crucial thing that performance of monetary system only means end that end being fair just distribution of real output settlement of obligations other words this seems align somewhat neoclassical economics money is veil over barter story but only if by barter we generalize any trade goods or social currency of debts feuds other obligations which think helps make it crystal clear neoclassical \u0026lsquoadam smith barter story is both incomplete reactionary \u0026mdash because it either implies money is only about barter goods or generalized sense it implies people who have money are \u0026lsquosocial credit hence have rightfully by divine decree earned their position as if theft exploitation corruption piracy prevented by divine decree of invisible hand proper nuance is that mmt is correct neoclassicals are wrong way allyn young would have arrived at this conclusion is because he seemed understand imposition of two opposing social forces that monetary operations are crucial friction that if abused by rich powerful can be severe obstacles justice that money form itself can function far better than veil over barter because it can facilitate trade commerce clear implication is that role of currency monopolist is minimize maximize that is government should not that they do just that they should play role monetary economy by suppressing abuse of money form by most powerful facilitate trade so that money does become more of mere veil mmt think would agree by mmt would think mean all mmt aware scholars activists mmt system itself does not think so can not agree nor disagree anything but you see tension mmt emphasises role of money banking way that steve keen\u0026#39s goodwin-minsky models vividly describe dynamically against almost all neoclassical myths but realm of political economy mmt de-emphasises importance of holding currency unit when only when it comes government policy considerations when you are issuer of currency you do not need worry about running out of money you neither have money nor do not have money because you issuer money is unit of your system of accounts that is because currency is not physical thing not commodity it is system of records of credits debts state currency form is tax credit tax credit is idea system is idea each have physical manifestations but physical tokens forms are almost irrelevant \u0026mdash recall island tribe yap islanders who used huge stone boulders some of which remained sunk sea as their tokens private money forms are different they are not tax credits but they are still i.o.us of their issuers commonality shared by all forms of money is that they are records of credit debt other words i.o.us of their issuer also common is what currency issuers mostly worry about which is how drive demand for their otherwise worthless i.o.us naïve naturalists anarchists austrian schoolers neoclassicals do not want grapple this problem they try wish it away like tooth fairy but it is only major problem wannabe currency issuer faces warren mosler wrote about how this fundamental problem is solved 7dif first using case of family parents issue their i.o.u children redeem it for extra playtime or whatever earn parents credits by doing household chores our relation governments is very similar abstract sense of course lesson is that demand for money is driven some way by powerful force parents family government nation king kingdom who commands loyal army priests running temple authority community or council running commune allyn young had somewhat naïve understanding of these facts probably related overly biased view about what constitutes justified private property rights so like lot of economists who came out of anti-marxist classical schools he tends shy away from recognizing role of governments as currency monopolists curiously though most marxists also shy away from recognizing government as currency monopolist for opposite ideological reasons guess being on opposite sides of class war can make people equally delusional sad thing about that last parenthetical remark is that neither marxists nor anti-marxists need believe myth that money is private creation of banks it helps both their cases if they recognize mmt reality you will not win class war by relying upon myth because other side will always grab advantage by abandoning myth going reality-based war misunderstanding energy this is just side note but important one it perhaps concerns one other veil of money but am not sure can justify it just yet as due money veil but will be giving this some later thought one problem allyn young had can be found one of legacies of his work which is endogenous growth theory this idea mainstream economics is that growth of economy by implication prosperity is mainly determined by factors operating within economy is not overly dependent upon external factors this is laughable theory it is one of great embarrassments economics that so many economists take it seriously but we can understand easily why if we think all energy is free then for sure economy can operate fairly fine endogenously but as physiocrats quesnay today kate raworth steve keen many other ecological economists understand role of energy production cannot be ignored no economic system gets energy endogenously most of it comes from sun that is ricardo-smith-marx tradition of thinking of either land or labour as only source of surplus value is utterly bone-headed wrong caveat this is that if you are able factor out energy your models some way perhaps as one unique external factor then maybe you can do ok macroeconomic analysis using endogenous growth theory ideas but there is no way pure endogenous growth theory works it is joke furthermore youngs supposed big idea that contra-quesnay contra-smith contra-marx it is not land or labour that is source of value but rather trade so young as naïve as all rest albeit little more original youngs thesis on trade being real source of wealth is shall we say interesting it is nuanced position but trade is not possible without energy so physiocrats are still foundation of economics higher layers of analysis just ignore this never had worry until today when energy demands are out-stripping biospheres regenerative capacity meaning no trade is going help this apply youngs thinking however is not fruitless because trade intellectual ideas is what will ultimately avoid ecological catastrophe so am prepared give allyn young his due on getting something good thought-out that went more than little bit beyond mainstream economic narrow-minded thought could come back this later identify this as fifth veil of money \u0026mdash idea that money is so dominant commerce that sales drive profits is so critical capitalism that role of energy as one common dominant factor all production of any kind from socialist capitalist feudalist gets utterly ignored or is it better say taken for granted so much that it is invisible invisible perhaps all but oil cartels electricity suppliers this last point \u0026mdash that energy is well understood be kingpin commodity that rules them all \u0026mdash is so well understood it is perhaps taken for granted except during energy cartel price gouging event but because it is so well understood as dominant driver of global currency inflation events when no currency is safe unless their governments comprehend mmt${}^\\ast$ think academic economists ignore role of energy production focus excessively on price instead think this is big blind spot of mainstream economics ${}^\\ast$mmt has perhaps only proper understanding of how foreign nation can combat oil monopoly price fixing which is let inflation run until energy cartels give up any government running fiat currency can always re-gauge their currency get oil meantime invest substitutes this is relative price adjustment story not hyperinflation story unless governments make it inflation bogeyman story by buying oil they suffer pass-through inflation but thats irrelevant maintaining fair domestic distribution because that government just raises their minimum wage welfare support number of zeroes they add on their lowest denomination currency bills is just digits of information no gold is at stake no grandchildren will ever be held ransom all that matters is relative price not absolute value stamped on currency or bank accounts what then matters is how much work your nation needs do export goods pay for oil imports that is always relative value story not runaway inflation story what also matters is psychological pressures coming from inflation fear-mongering which is real problem that mmt cannot directly help you except inform you problem is only peoples imaginations${}^{\\dagger}$ which is not trivial help margaret thatcher had exactly this psychological problem when she complained price of milk twice that when she child somehow she did not comprehend wages had gone up more than double all without putting any gold or crown jewels at stake ${}^{\\dagger}$i think it is fair say only mmt people understand this however this is no inoculation against getting sh*t scared that saying this truth out loud can earn ridicule condemnation truth is not always easy tell can put proverbial fear of god into those who dare speak it used not be too much of problem when human energy use easily well within planetary ecosystem boundaries but today that is no longer case so modern economists post 1980 or thereabouts are morally obligated update all their models account for crucial role of energy production especially at macroeconomic level where up until today it has been almost totally ignored this wise do not fault allyn young since he writing time when planetary ecological stress boundaries not understood seemed invisible anyway am not going call blindness role of energy production one of veils of money but hushed whispers think it really is one of veils of money so would be fifth on my list only reason for whispering here is that am not exactly sure of true historical story of how energy got ignored if engineers physicists had been first economists not philosophers of politics morality then think energy would always have been critical economics but that just not way history unfolded first veil am not going say all this is some sort of metaphysical characterisation of various veils im just free-flow writing here this veil is first one pop out veil is way money is so heavily used commercial trade that true origins history gets obscured dominant use of money is thus veil over true history origins origins of money are well understood by archeologists anthropologists knapp mitchell-innes graeber hudson wray among others true history is that forms of temple emperor or state authority currency all arose from settlement of debts thus records of credit every debt had corresponding credit for sure double entry book-keeping much later invention but before book-keeping people held these records of obligations well enough their heads any record of such debt or credit is form of money highly abstract sense i.o.u material sense monetary units properly came into existence when grain weights of rice or barley or wheat used as artifice or stand-in for those records of course paper records that reliable could have been used before solving forgery problem of paper records discovered tally sticks pretty good currency records note that none of this implies currency unit always creation of government state which is narrow chartalism sometimes means of settlement of debts so currency as means of payment can be created outside of government perhaps by feudal lord oligarch religious temple or some other power or authority or collective mmt story of money is still chartalist but is generalized chartalism \u0026mdash which means it almost always practically takes some power or authority run currency unit payments system they have be either trusted feared or both on this topic margaret atwoods accounts payback debt shadow side of wealth give vivid history that would make any zeitgeist movement philes wet their pants zeitgeist movement folks are not all bad though their motives are all good helping hindering this duality mmt exists any institutionally arranged system it is almost tautology because unless something is deterministic machine designed built function perfectly then system it runs will have imperfections some may help bias outcomes good way some bad way for example some of us joke that dick cheney most accomplished mmt policy maker past 25 years mostly for bad john maynard keynes galbraith most accomplished mmt policy makers during world war ii galbraith post-war era mostly for good at least by account their sides won war extent that success had anything do moving private production into public sector for that period successful war time efforts are examples of where there is one type of veil of money partially lifted everyone works for war effort issuing enough currency is not even debated issuer always finds enough currency they do so either by suspending artifice of gold standard or they just implement pure fiat money operations without gold standard veil forever after gold standard is thus revealed by wars be veil there never really gold money currency is always tax credit issuer tells you what it is worth if they tell you it redeems for $\\pi 100$ ounces of gold then thats fiat price what it can purchase then depends upon relative price of gold other goods but who gets that purchasing power is still choice of currency issuer like control of nuclear power primitive fire powerful force or technology can always be used commit atrocities mmt is no exception but monetary system is ancient has existed for over 5000 years is often force for good when used wisely it is not free market or natural equilibrium that achieves good or terrible social outcomes it is our wilful design or negligence that another near tautology if pure free market ever exist it would be by human conscious willful design my thought on that is always that what most people desire is fair market not free market freedom implies all sorts of bad things through fallacies of composition everyone is free stand up seats at football game or opera but they dont they constrain themselves for \u0026lsquogreater good greater good hence constraint is really more freedom not less because we are now talking about different qualities of freedom all freedoms are not equal quality freedom absolutists are knuckleheads use technical term people will bitch moan at us yeah but who gets say what counts as quality freedom ideal answer is always demos current realpolitk answer is oligarchs point is it is encumbent upon collective demos crack realpolitik corral governments towards ideal do so by claiming back their government from oligarchs oligarchs do have ownership claims on todays governments but that is unjust claim all people must act destroy that illegitimate claim understanding mmt gives people clear understanding how \u0026mdash oligarchs do not control monetary system government does demos must therefore reclaim their government it does not rightfully belong oligarchs second veil second veil is gold standard idea that because you need some token make payment token or stuff it is made out of itself is somehow money as explained above gold standard does not make gold currency it makes gold buffer stock if issuer runs out of gold currency rapidly deflates since buffer stock becomes scarce it is insane unstable system all mainstream economists agree mmt that sustained moderate inflation is better than any deflation but especially better than bursts of deflation bank runs cross of gold artificial austerity all that third veil third veil of money is way idea occurs unthinking people that \u0026lsquohaving money is seen as prestige by default almost taken as implying person lots of money has earned it so is \u0026lsquogood person or has been \u0026lsquohard working sometimes this is true veils are like that they will often reveal true silhouette money as this veil obscures corruption greed obscures fact poorest people are not deserving of being poor only mmt recognizes why this is true because mmt understands source of all unemployment monetary economy \u0026mdash that source is not laziness or apathy mmt this fashion follows tradition of edwards deming who pointed out japanese management or any management experts who would listen that they should not punish lowest performing workers because no matter how perfect their production system all workers top notch talents there is always lowest performer be found being lowest performer given period thus means next nothing it is incontrovertible statistic system as whole has be judged not trivially existing least productive worker deming said that if you have poor performing worker who should on paper be ok worker something is more likely wrong system money institutions at governmental level only at governmental level mmt tells us our already existing monetary legal institutions make state currency units mere scorepoints \u0026mdash as far as government is concerned \u0026mdash so government policy maker their unit of account state currency but only their states currency is mere veil over business of banking commerce regulation but this is absolutely critical awareness too many people on both political left right fail see this dual aspect money specifically state currency not private money forms caricature political divides somewhat id say lefties see money as evil some sense but focus on power of money how this is unfairly distributed they fail recognise full mmt picture because they do not see that governments control state currency system so are not beholden collecting taxes off rich people there are many other ways governments can ensure that there is no undue wealth inequality society e.g prevent unbridled capital accumulation first place right-wingers see money as essential but only as veil over barter because they cannot bring themselves see any essential role for government private commerce they fail recognize full mmt picture because they do not understand what drives monetary numeraire on right-wingers for second we know that what drives demand for fiat currency is imposition of liabilities of some kind or another it has never been any other way throughout all history fact one pretty good definition of money is that money is i.o.u \u0026mdash promise of issuer redeem that is equivalent record of credit debt issuer is debt receiver credit when receiver of i.o.u returns it issuer debt is redeemed creditor is back zero credit right-wingers fail understand all past present monetary systems because they cannot wrap their heads around this definition of money most right-wingers money is some physical substance like gold so they hate this concept of fiat currency which is nothing but scorepoints on secured ledger books one can go ahead use concept of physical stuff like gold as money but then you have re-wire all your macroeconomic models my knowledge no one has ever successfully done this more critically practice no nation has ever implemented such commodity money system though many right-wingers seem think those systems have existed eras of feudal rule when empires had broken down it is true that at some times gold coins or other metals used as socially understood commodity currency but problem is that this relied upon mass social misconception metal coins always traded for goods according numeraire stamped on coins this never held equal trade value of actual metal which normally lot less than numeraire face value on coins \u0026mdash because otherwise people would quickly learn melt down coins often illegally sell them actually writing it that way am not sure if it is correct call it mass social misconception people living at time had understand system since they did not go around melting down metal coins yet there misconception at some point because most accounts eventually tell story that metal currency so digging it up out of ground or mining it banking often allow other philosophers activists have their own definitions so if right-winger comes along insists money is commodity like gold would normally if this mapped science problem let it go but we cannot let it go when it comes macroeconomics because it makes huge f-ing difference whether or not state currency units we get tax liabilities imposed upon us are real stuff or mere scorepoints you want it be scorepoints why because you do not want motivate pirates because you want regulator of this system be able actually implement some justice balance economy so that increasing returns wealth do not become automatic destabiliser because you want inequality wealth holdings be surmountable because you want way eliminate nominal poverty so you do not want their scorepoints be artificially limited imagine at football game your side scores try or touchdown win at final second scorekeeper sorry lads ive run out of points minute ago this is all critical for justice even right-wingers like justice so they aught want fiat currency system points on government scoreboard but sometimes there is just no getting through reactionary minds of conservatives who seem simply be genetically ill-disposed all forms of government encroachment upon private markets this is highly ironic because market goods for sale semblance of democratic state currency system does not exist without government force tax collector imposing return of liabilities trouble for right-wingers libertarians is that if state government does not exist you only get something worse which is landlord imposing their own private liabilities upon you give me half your grain sheep or ill burn your hut down fourth veil because money is seen as instrument of most powerful because having excess credit gives someone more purchasing power this store-of-value function of state currency is veil over proper role of ideal democratic state it is because people hate see leviathan exerting power over little people that big government big brother is seen as anathema this is however veil over reality that without government little people aka working class are even more entirely screwed it is better have monopoly currency issuer protecting working class than have peasants real workers fend for themselves some libertarian anarcho-capitalist fantasy world problem is our governments have never been protectors of working class all gains made by working class have been by collectivist approaches exerting influence upon governments at chagrin of people running government government is crucial institution for worker emancipation but workers cannot just sit back wait for their rights be granted human rights have be exerted have be fought for have be won on moral grounds well before they are won on material grounds way warren mosler has put this is that labour market is not fair game role of democratic government is balance that playing field workers need more protection than bosses when people adopt view that money should be private system they are placing this veil over rightful role of democratic government conclude think there are other veils of money but ill stop at these for now think they are most important veils understand previous chapter back blog next post neural nets mmt toc money banking

commenting on highlights from perry mehrlings mooc on money banking online from inet today its comment on when mehrling starts out by alerting his students that he is going talk about ecb as if it private entity then only later lectures talk about money as creation of state thought this is completely wrong emphasis euro is mmt system but very weirdly structured so as look function like private or endogenous currency system but that is one of veils of money it is easy make state currency system mmt look like private currency just listen all lunatics who claim us fed is private bank they obviously all believe us dollar is created by fed not by congress they are complete nutters but it is easy forgive them because congress also acts like fed is hands-off private entity so it is little unfair blame nutters for their warped views those power controlling usa mmt system share lot of those warped views what is weird here is that usa at least some of eu nutters also tend hate government yet are following government narrative however this weirdness can be explained those same nutters are often ones getting elected into government yeah people who hate government are running governments why not from their perspective best way destroy something truly well is often from inside this is why we gotta stop electing them if enough people playing baseball game think it is cricket what you will observe is cricket game played catching mitts awkwardly rounded bats you see duality what does not change are field mitts ball bats but what is weird is how people use that equipment result is terrible game of cricket or worse game of baseball one of those is analogous usa other eu perhaps am not sure which is more appropriate mapping but how is mehrling any different nutters think mehrling understands basics of mmt but if you do then think moral obligation is talk about true account of currency monopoly first which means state theory of money has go first because it is primary pedagogically order matters aside you can tell bad teachers from good ones by order which they teach topics ive had this physics best way teach quantum mechanics is tell truth first before mathematical formalism which is that we have no clue what ontological basis for quantum mechanics is so everything follow is pure descriptive formalism wavefunction is not ontology so dont try construct ontology based on properties of wavefunction even better physics teacher might add although we do not think wavefunction is ontology it could be ontology point is we do not know so do not second guess nature it is ok conjecture ontology then test it however ecb certainly does function lot like private currency endogenous money system but that is only because that is way governments seem wish it be here by governments we really mean those power those power europe are wannabe oligarchs so yeah they are highly prone abusing state currency system treating it like private currency system this is major source of mess euroland hierarchy of money here is relvant bit from lecture on this commented all well good treat ecb as bankers bank if indeed that is what it is but it is not it is creation of eu so is creation of governments problem being that is plural so only more powerful members of eu germany france belgium really have what is akin monopoly currency issuing capacity contrast usa where congress has all monopoly since they can fire fed board vote nuance that should be put up-front is that these governments are de facto owned by bankers oligarchs through distortion of democracy so legalistically mehrling is wrong claim central banks are private institutions but functionally he is kind of right but only because demos keep electing neoliberal governments who actively want be beholden private oligarch interests most neolib politicians aspire be members of oligarchy ok but fact monetary system gets abused several ways makes mehrlings point about hierarchy of financial instruments reality seriously big f-ing problem for social stability we need like things production equivalences remain rough equivalences as trade parity principles predatory financial speculators merchants of financial ponzi schemes tariffs other banking corruptions mess this up one nations tariffs become anothers subsidies you cannot expect people who get squeezed by unfair prices not fight back if they are lucky their government will fight back for them guess be fair mehrling if aim is learn how think like central banker then he has fair point leading ecb as bankers bank what am saying is why would any student want learn how think like central banker first first is bias so first you want students think like expertly informed workers who understand mmt system understand abuse of it then later it is fine teach them how central bankers view system why central bankers are wrong credit is not money about minutes into lecture segment mehrling seems take pains claim money is not credit here he is just plain wrong at least language framing he starts one view of his hierarchy of money gold is ultimate money which is cringe gold has never been money gold standard is not regime where gold is money it is regime where temporarily as long as trust gold supply lasts government or other currency issuer promises redeem for gold when gold runs out or is known be running out they always get off gold standard until some later time when gold reserves are grabbed back it is charade no one ever uses gold for purchasing it is just place-holder just like grain weights of wheat corn or barley used ancient times they are just placeholders for currency unit people who are not fetishists do not want or need gold they want credits they need eat so they want bread not gold metal form of currency is irrelevant all money is i.o.u of issuer so all money is someones credit whoever receives iou all money is equally someones debt debt of issuer but you might think am being pedantic it almost too cringe listen rest of this lecture segment mehrling claims money is how credit is repaid true but that just means money is credit because single currency system all credits debits are same units it is all same money form what mehrling is getting at is subtler point which is that when you have positive digits your bank account or coins or notes your pocket then these are unique ious because they are only ious on earth that you can redeem for tax liability extinction that is why state money seems different bank credit but if they are denominated same units then there is no difference both forms are tax credits operationally legally difference is process of how you get them into your bank account or wallet but when government says by fiat that their tax credit redeems for gold they are not thereby making gold money they are making gold buffer stock do not think mehrling understands this but it is critical thing understand what else mehrling really means is that commercial bank credit endogenous money is not same as state currency exogenous money this is agreement mmt agreement all legal operational reality most nations outside those who use foreign currency as their tax credits difference of course is stark so am not being pedantic there are painful realities taking on bank debt you get credit initially along signing explicit or one-time credit card agreement repay then you spend or why else use credit card so your credit gets moved into someone elses bank account they are now credit bank you are debt equally at least until interest charges accrue but when interest charges accrue bank gains more credit upon you you gain more debt dollar for dollar so sure enough endogenously all credit is debt however it holds exogenous as well but entirely different way profoundly different consequences this is mmt account of state currency state issues their currency by fiat not by credit you do not really need pay it back however someone has pay some fraction of it back due imposed tax liabilities but these are generalized arrangements can be arranged so that poorest people need pay no tax return that is difference whether you are poor or rich if you receive bank debt you must repay or lose your house or file for bankruptcy but if you receive government currency you do not have repay \u0026mdash so for instance if you are unfortunately poor then someone else will have pay some fraction of states currency back state need repay governments currency is thus not because receiver public sector worker or welfare beneficiary or contractor has taken upon debt burden fact it is opposite government has debt burden it is only society as whole that has tax liability burden that is by design so that principle operation of fiat currency can work without poorest shouldering burden since taxation is what drives demand for state currency someone has have tax liability imposed upon them so more justly that should be those who accumulate most by failing spend circulate their income they aught bear most of tax return burden \u0026mdash if we have well designed system but once bank credit goes into someone elses wallet they cannot distinguish it from government currency because it is same unit kilogram is kilogram whether it is chicken being weighed or brick it is only macroeconomically that distinction between issuing operations gets fully noticed ratio of private debt government issue or ratio of private debt gdp if private debt is too much higher than government fiat issue is growing faster then we have severe recessionary bias totally needlessly also \u0026mdash maybe this is something mehrling gets wrong later on am not yet sure \u0026mdash bank credit money is only as demand as government fiat currency since government licences banks bank money any creditors is equivalent government issue since this currency unit is same unit when say as demand as mean generally macro obviously people would prefer being given currency for selling goods or their labour time rather than having take bank credit themselves so it is not bank credit that is just as much demand it is currency freely floating that is demand once you get tax credit you dont care where it came from unless you are macroeconomist that is then you do care steve keens minksy models show you why you should care bank credit sources produce instability government issue does not however when chap like mehrling comes along says credit is not money he muddies waters it might even be poisoning well because if you see money as standalone thing that is no other entitys obligation or debt then you are both crazy privileging people who can mine that stuff out of ground or on computer or pirate stuff partly this is semantics but society semantics are incredibly important if we all have common misunderstanding that money equals some scarce stuff that everyone just agrees can settle payments then you are down cryptocurrency dead-end road allowing all sorts of scams frauds whereas if you take mmt semantics that all money is iou of issuer \u0026mdash promise redeem \u0026mdash then you have at least possibility of just society payments layer possibility because justice still needs be fought for protected mmt is only intellectual weapon that on-going spiritual war or jihad why say semantics matters is because it makes difference you can easily pirate gold or crytocurrency latter is called cracking not hacking or software back-door but you cannot pirate records on secured public ledger at least not very easily you have own ledger private bank deposit accounts are extremely secure most nations extent they are insecure they become pirate-able people are tight-assed about their bank accounts will soon let police or serious fraud office know if their account gets tampered extent bankers are at bare minimum trusted at least not fiddle too much numbers your bank account then banking system prevents piracy history shows empirically it works it just works except when thieves own banks 2008 gfc style read william blacks book \u0026#39the best way rob bank is own one\u0026#39 but even lead-up 2008 gfc no bankers fiddling numbers your bank account they do not need they need fiddle numbers their own bank account mark them ones up my dudes admit this matters if done on large scale because ratio of bank account numbers is what matters for social equity justice if million bankers can just mark-up their accounts by ten times that of everyone else using keyboard they gain relatively more purchasing power regardless of what stuff you think money happens be fool it is social consequences of which issuer you get currency from that matters it is better get it as creditor work for government or sell someone rather than as debtor you ideally at macro level want government be principle debtor because they cannot run out of their won currency this is thinking behind positive money movement which

general audience on some of dynamical systems ideas underlying macroeconomics our focus is on macro mesoeconomics so we are not interested particular stock prices or even sectors we are interested main aggregated market indices usa spx nasdaq whatever this is partly pragmatic if you liken economic system weather climate climate is very predictable highly macro weather is not too micro whenever you see such qualitative level distinctions you know you are dealing dynamical system so-called emergent properties top-down causations purely bottom-up system that admits reductionistic description can always be modelled using micro-casual analysis \u0026mdash enough compute power genuine top-down controlled system does not admit such analysis but most dynamical systems are not entirely top-down economy of large nation is such hybrid system it has micro-causal macro-causal responses feedbacks so also involves potential for useful mesoscopic analysis for philosophers genuine top-down causation is impossible classical physics so is considered impossible economics because economic system is considered not be sensitive quantum mechanics but this is incredibly naïve foolish there is stupid dumb way you can see it is foolish at very basic level because all computers running modern fintec systems nanosecond trading algorithms absolutely must rely upon quantum mechanics because their transistors cannot function otherwise but this is stupid because transistors are mere means classical end computation on traders desktop is turing machine process even sub-turing because it lacks infinite memory tape so all that is totally classical physics input into economic system so where is top-down economics you do not have believe roger penrose think quantum mechanics pays role human thinking processes but you should understand human consciousness is not explained by physics inner subjective phenomenal qualia so no matter what source of human consciousness is we do not really care for present purposes whatever it is it is not physics so human psychology is not driven by bottom-up blind physical events you will need read my other website t4g theory see one set of reasons why or just trust me human beings making good bad lame chad decisions are top-down influences on economics bottom-up signals as other inputs generalized forces one question one might naïvely ask is what are generalized forces economic system that move prices six billion dollar question most analysts give up use brute raw statistical probability theory analysis which is admitting you have no idea about forces you only know distributions of outcomes which think is fair approach even state-of-the-art dynamical systems models ann artificial neural networks thing is no dynamical system model can do better prediction or modelling job than accuracy of your modelling assumptions permits no ann can do better prediction or modelling job than data it gets trained on can admit this is because all real anns are finite state machines so they lack conscious thought so lack genuine creative insight capacity so cannot generate more than what information theory la shannon can be found their inputs this is all so unless you subscribe radical panpsychism anyhow this is big issue for our effort over at dougbot project because what argue douglas is that we are automating his canniness not creating new thinking being that can oracle stock prices pragmatic terms this does not really effect our research because research team needs push pull but for you philosophers of finance this might be of interest also if you are investor who has come across some wild good claims about how genius has found way beat markets earn you insane returns did someone just say carlo pietro giovanni guglielmo tebaldo ponzi rather than looking for oracle powers idea method for dougbot is use hybrid techniques simplest is use dynamical system model of steve keen goodwin-minsky variety get very high level macro dynamics correct dude portugal did this for portuguese economy pedro sousa you can get his phd paper here being eu this thesis not trivial bank flows had be carefully analysed sousa did excellent job such models are not going say squat about stock prices but they might have useful information for informing us about macro aggregates like s\u0026ampp500 or nasdaq or new zealand npx trouble is macroeconomic models deal fiscal flow or godley tables there is no real generalized force them for seeing how relative prices move because complexity available currently these minsky models there is only one price level or two if you are clever asset prices call them fictional goods can be partially de-coupled from goods prices real goods being physical things people consume not numbers on bits of paper all forces most of keen-minsky models can currently build are behavioural equations such as phillips curve rest is just stock-flow consistency mere accounting your nation does have have fair justice system have accounting rules satisfied reality though it is not trivial imagine rampant counterfeit imagine rampant bank fraud such deviant illegal behaviour would invalidate minksy-keen model unless we accounted for it \u0026mdash black market ops counterfeit rows godley tables for most part we hope be able ignore such factors here have conjecture get wild insane returns like one particular fund claims you need be dealing black market or something illegal drug dealers traffickers will be prepared make insane losses due nature of their business they can still eat caviar but their loss is someone elses gain so black ops hedge fund bet investor who is extremely diversified this leaves us generalized forces driving relative absolute price movements that will need be empirically determined that is hard task but some physics principles can help us how can you measure force if something is moving you can measure force by measuring acceleration but thats only provided there is single force which is not case general multiple forces can cancel whenever there are pushes pulls then this manifests as type of stress however it is still always true that any net force will be manifested as acceleration thats what one worries about for price movements net force we can do this for lot of fiscal flow data published by fred bis good early news is that we can see hints of causal relations from looking at accelerations lagged margin debt spx this is promising because although there is still lot of noise we can see generalized force acting conceptual idea of movements incomes wages other macroeconomics variables can be illustrated diagram here physics concept of energy needs be replaced economics by something like optimal output such as productivity or real output so on one side theres too little starvation on other side too much resource depletion illustration is only showing one-dimension real world there will be multiple dimensions so instead of curve wed actually have ball system of interest firm household sector commodity or any sub-system of economy you are interested that causes changes $y$ objective function general point is that viewed this way only as metaphor there are forces at work macroeconomics on right diagram interest rate is shown as repeller force if you are middle income at top of energy curve you are maybe safe but unstable getting poor or rich since interest rate hikes hurt poor reward rich it is force that creates growing wealth divide deceptive thing about simple diagrams like is-lm models is that they are not showing full manifold of all effective objective functions happiness social unrest peace optimal food output optimal savings \u0026ampc on right diagram drew curve going back upwards at higher wealth levels which for instance might be due third dimension manifold not visible that effects $y$ when too many rich people exist you can imagine several such factors from too many idle people lowering optimal useful output social unrest lowering unit worker productivity will maybe re-use these metaphors further discussion because although theyre not quantitative they are useful for illustrating conceptual idea that are very important macroeconomics id summarize this as going beyond stupid equilibrium supply\u0026ndashdemand curves its high-dimensional manifold problem is economic system has many people their feet on gas peddles brakes all over place we are looking at superposition of them all aggregate so it is always going be noisy conjecture our research is based upon is that some of this will be gaussian noise if it is then we are not dealing power law dynamics not fat tails signals this is vital for getting well-trained neural nets anns do not like noise it is best think of ann as merely canning your reasoning capacity when comatose or dead drunk it is going be feeble but you can make out numbers letters maybe stop versus go signs what if forces are static stress am not sure economics has this concept but consumer sentiment is possibly qualitative form of data we might be able use but at this stage it would be sketchy it is something stock brokers finance journalist use debt-to-gdp is stock divided by flow stocks are lot like static forces you can measure their velocity acceleration get flow variable but if you can also find force signal stock then that is acting like stress good example of this is major example great crash of 1929 gfc of 2007-8 both had private debt excess of 150% of gdp this stress variable its rate of change over 10% that velocity measure so rate of change of acceleration indicating underlying force both stress velocity seem be triggers neither separately this is from empirical work by richard vague see brief history of doom although if am right there should have been impulse triggered great crash that would be short burst accelerator if recall from reading galbraith great crash 1929 force mostly psychological boundless hope optimism 2007-8 force emergence of just few short traders they pushed subprime mortgage market off knife-edge balance of wild optimism real estate cdos mbss but it is always more complicated rumour gossip wild optimism yields neurosis \u0026ampc it is hard gauge these forces but time series accelerations forces produce are always visible should have more write about this coming months we are trying find dominant accelerators guess it is also worth mentioning wall street quants probably know accelerators they just do not make that knowledge public so we have do this work for our community of followers forces from ledger books godley tables explained here by ty keynes do not model generalized economic forces per se they model accounting rules flows are determined by behavioural equations that relate stock variables minsky-keen models for example phillips curve for wage rate as function of employment price level behavioral function here $ft$ $$ \\frac{dx_i}{dt} ft x_1 x_2 \\ldots $$ is like generalized force but if dependent variable $x_i$ here is not price then it is not so useful for dougbot price might however be sensitive $x_i$ which would be useful know also wed need $x_i$ itself be flow not stock that is because rate of change $dx dt$ is velocity not acceleration if $x_i$ stock then $ft$ would be velocity e.g how fast cash is turning over if we only look at velocities we would not have causal model get cause we need force forces are drivers velocities are effects of drivers stocks are lowest downstream effects where things end up after given time period need write caveat all this is largely metaphorical outside steve keens work no one really understands financial system force-like terms it is all energy-like \u0026mdash thermodynamic equilibrium \u0026mdash if you wanted physics analogy which is all wrong-headed neoclassical thinking btw reason steve keen says his minksy dynsys models prove mmt is because he says mmt is just accounting this is pretty awful of steve but he can be forgiven we mmt enthusiasts would say mmt is lot more than accounting it is about societies legal financial institutional arrangements much more than just accounting rules however part steve keen is right about use of godley tables because of these legal rules old days it used be ledger books money created by fountain pen youd have hard time back then doing real-time forecasting financial time series published these days amateur computer programmer can probably see near real time velocities accelerators financial data interest rate repeller other social forces there is of course lot more mmt analysis its implications for system dynamics stock prices move by one type of set of forces but wages by others often activists are more interested wage consumer price goods price movements could give fig about stock price movements these cannot all be completely de-coupled because of fiscal constraints embedded banking system government has freedom set absolute price level what appears keen-goodwin-minsky model but not all relative prices unless they are totalitarian government which we have never really perfectly seen on earth just approximations one reason steve keen tarnishes his reputation by abusing mmt community as nothing but accountants is because it matters politically whether people understand mmt system use it wisely that has been point of mmt social movement for over 30 years as of date from founding by warren mosler bill mitchell randall wray joined by stephanie kelton pavlina tcherneva matt forstadter scott fulwiler now legions of others particular what steve keen has never acknowledged correctly afaik is insight of bill mitchell on buffer stocks that mmt system which is currently operational reality most nations world uses labour buffer this is vital mmt understanding without it you get idiots like steve keen can say this since he is good internet friend aussie so he knows am just blowing hot air but only half-joking claiming mmt is nothing but accounting say steve that labour buffer is not accounting it is matter of grave social justice or injustice depending on how people understand buffer also think steve keen is very old school on treasury bonds story warren mosler had insight no one else agreed him at time that when fed sells treasury bonds for monetary operations it functionally same as treasury selling bonds for fiscal operations he realized you cannot call them different functions still this day most post-keynesians disagree this is not mere accounting squabble people agree about software operations think it is government function insight fed cannot be thought of as private entity independent of us government if you still think otherwise you are not mmt aware thing is it makes huge difference political economy so is far far beyond impact of just accounting it can ruin peoples lives always those who lives are already most miserable by pushing austerity politics using interest rate repeller among other injustices would also claim that warren mosler best understood impact of moving floating exchange rate fiscal space this freed up for government post-keynesians generally not all still do not comprehend this steve keen seems still be one of them most post-keynesian think exchange rate is exogenous constraint mmt says it is not not if you understand correct actual software-driven legally instituted monetary operations available governments but this includes legal let me say it again legal arrangements mmt says these matter over above accounting principles this is vital for understanding why no fit currency issuing government has any foreign exchange constraint they do if they make up one only mosler 1995 understood this most post-keynesians still do not hence we have stupid debates about trade policy exports as cost imports as benefit mmt story which is correct exports are price you pay for your imports this is not neoclassical thinking as steve keen slurs mmt community it is just logic but logic can cause suffering for poorer nations if people do not understand it like logic of what happens when you ignore momentum walk into street lamp poles lastly for today will mention two key conditional fundamentals that post-keynesians do not seem understand or know deposit holders know crap all about their bank so liability side of banking is not place for market discipline central bank policy levers are about prices interest rates not quantities why are these conditional fundamentals it is because they apply when nation uses tax credit which is non-convertible currency on floating exchange rate without those conditions central bank has employ methods like bond issuance control interest rates control weakly exchange rates they furthermore will want deliberately cause mass unemployment limit inflation like psychopaths who have broad public approval for their ax murdering floating exchange rates there is no need for those functions above two fundamentals apply on fundamental mosler writes even wall street analysts cant reliably do this assess bank insolvency risk also thought it worth quoting rest of warrens paragraph on banking proposals for helping smaller banks regulation supervision on asset side then became imperative while we have seen periodic failures due lax regulation supervision of asset side of us banking system its work progress alternative of using liability side of banking for market discipline exposes real economy far more disruptions far more destructive systemic risk you cannot get more mmt than this if you do not understand monetary operations you will introduce instability inequality what ticked me off about steves flippant comments that it is not only warren who has been preaching truth for years steve keens acquaintance charles goodhart has too as warren relates fairly blisteringly true might add those who understand reserve accounting monetary operations including those directly involved monetary operations at worlds central banks have known for decades that banking causation runs from loans deposits reserve requirements if any being merely \u0026lsquoresidual overdraft at central bank not control variable this includes professor charles goodhart at bank of england who has written extensively on this subject for roughly half century endlessly debating \u0026lsquomonetarist academic economists who spew gold standard fixed exchange rate rhetoric who are unaware of how monetary operations are altered when there is no legal convertibility of currency once steve acknowledges all this other generalized forces mmt social movement he will apologise us he is good guy mean really good nice guy salt of earth bit of fire cracker his hand too though also am pretty sure he is trolling us when he says mmt is just accounting so took bait also he said that at mmt conference so of course he having aussie lark but he can also be damaging mmt movement when he says such things more publicly because they are wrong this matters because steve is very influential economist activist note self need write theory section on trade when we write about trade important thing is not be too simplistic naïve word seem need use lot fadhel kaboub jan kregel are mmt aware have decent body of work on international trade exchange rate is not their problem biggest problems by far are imperial power abuses neocolonialism just broadly war injustice dysfunctional justice systems weaker nations fixing up their exchange rate is pretty much negligible help all that but they need mmt lens know what do about it when they restore civil society australia will never have foreign exchange constraint because their government know how tell foreign buyers of their land politicians piss off \u0026mdash at least if they want too if they do not want well then their civilized bbqs shrimp could turn into charcoaled gruel purchased at tesco lotus shop even more generally we are dougbot project using mmt understanding lens do finer grain price analysis it is not merely accounting although we could call it post-keynesian or institutionalist mmt is superset of these schools not subset anyone thinking otherwise is just being very nasty founders of movement like mosler mitchell randall wray is better arbiter since he post-keynesian still is he considers himself now mmt thought not that any of these labels names matter but funnily economics profession they seem like they do not physics or mathematics where come

douglas mmt trader is that get exposed now trolls critics who want debunk mmt this might be fodder for several posts so this is part-1 am not going launch into esoteric philosophy money crankery so dont be scared my approach is more mathematical sciences lets be generous call macroeconomics social science there is theory empirical data test it just not always conclusively so we can formulate definitions theorems using definitions then test them if you think we cannot then you are on another planet like yanis varoufakis we cannot easily communicate my friend seriously though what yanis says is that we cannot replicate trials so economics is not like other sciences but social sciences have always been this way you cannot lab replicate entire human culture science is however not defined by needs replicated control trials rcts are only one method available science if rcts are not available you have test theories models other ways which can be done it is just not as easy besides which rcts are controlled real world is often not so rcts cannot ever constitute all of empirics science is economics science what varoufakis gets correct is that lot of professional economists are fact not engaged any science this he would agree someone like steve keen who would also say mainstream neoclassical school of economics is not science what is it then answer is that it is mathematical theory if formulated consistently it violates common presumptions real world real people are not rational have poor capacity maximize their subjective utility utility as neoclassical must non-circularly define it when it is formulated idealized axioms neoclassicals want believe are true real world theory can fact become inconsistent neoclassical axioms imply there is no stable price vector${}^\\dagger$ so for these few other reasons neoclassical economics is fictional fantasy if consistent it is not applicable real world if inconsistent then it is invalid every possible world that is what you call diabolical piece of mathematics waste of human intellect like string theory that proves strings are inconsistent ${}^\\dagger$see john blatt dynamic economic systems definitions give formal semantics idea of definition is convey meaning but this is only possible if we are communicating some sentient conscious knower if not then we are just formalising our thinking for ourselves but that can be worthwhile thing do define what you mean make it record then you can have what wittgenstein thought impossible private language if someone uses different definition for word say money us then we have possibility of needless debate argument do not wish engage that sort of thing so if you are going communicate meaningfully us as mmt aware activists you will need either accept temporarily our definitions or lay-out your own beg us temporarily explore yours mmt we have simple enough definition of money money is iou of issuer whatever issuer promises redemption for iou dictates perhaps subjectively value of money what it is worth you how much effort you will be prepared obtain their iou notice no such thing as bank is yet mentioned money can indeed exist without banks but iou does require some sort of record keeper even if it is you keeping record your head real world these are normally banks or one of functions of banks we then have new term define for state currency or state money state currency is iou of state which for normative purposes mmt defines be tax credit that which is accepted as redemption for payment of tax liabilities state owes you redemption of one unit of tax liability when you receive their currency tokens this is one reason among others but primary reason why you accept states currency payments am not talking about psychologically why you accept dollars rather than gold or bitcoin most of you accept dollars because everyone else does so understand that you have know macroeconomics because there is no way as whole society will accept worthless bits of paper for payments system as whole knows something backs state currency as soon as they learn it is not gold stored fort knox they realize it is pure state power it is not by genial social agreement state can use gold as fig leaf of course hide naked reality of their fiat currency should they feel need do so mmter would not need them too enjoying full naked splendour bloody perverts phrase money is ambiguous since it can refer tokens or account records or units of records unit of account provided you appreciate there is this ambiguity we will allow you talk us using word money if it is clear enough from context which meaning you are employing few other definitions axioms simple postulates that we agree need not be proven which will not belabour by writing them all down see theory mmt can now claim few corollaries one is that it now matters great deal whether you can get tax credits only from government or only from private banks or both because bankers can be tiny little assholes about their tightness on credit why because governments deem them insolvent if they cannot cover their liabilities how frickin dare that government encroach upon beautiful efficiency of private sector all going making currency valuable all it matters also because if governments allow themselves emit their own tax credits then demos has some measure of protection from predatory bankers also government itself is now not beholden pecuniary interests of private bankers it seems me this is sociologically extremely important note positive money activists why would government \u0026mdash as governors \u0026mdash refuse allow themselves ability issue their own tax credits why am even bothering ask question mmt is thus not merely accounting money story which is political story makes huge f-ing difference if you get it wrong you can get mired austerity politics all sorts of other abuses crimes against humanity allowing involuntary unemployment all for no good reason but ignorance can give you warren moslers pithy summary of money treasury bond price stories all nutshell which is as succinct statement that can find pointing out mmt is much more than mere accounting warren wrote its mmt recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof see implications are truly profound you only need dip your toe mmt literature then you will see there is whole lot of depth that pool you cannot grok it all day just at least take look at mosler\u0026#39s proposals here for starters what about bank money lets see banks issue credit which is your promise repay not banks bank allows you create your own official iou amazingly you can pay your tax liabilities it even better some idiot down road running grocery store will accept this give you groceries for it arent banks marvellous also unit is state currency which means what bank issues is always iou of state we are not talking about corporate paper here either but even that is also denominated states unit of account dollar yen euro so banks are offering you yom \u0026mdash you owe me which is functionally just inverse of iou how heck can they do this it is because they are licenced use states unit of account so when you take bank credit now being debt bank you are nonetheless credit government who will always accept your currency receipt of tax payment this is why you can always use your bank money purchase goods why else do you take on debt bank seller will take your filthy bank money because them it is functionally exactly same as clean green government issued currency they may indeed pay off their tax liabilities fraction of your purchase problem here is commercial banking system private banks are not currency monopoly so you can certainly pay off your tax liabilities but then you still owe bank or theyll take your house off you or whatever you implicitly or explicitly offered as collateral but why why can bank not pay itself do really have say why they are licenced regulated by state anyone heard of jail for fraud laws anyone so this is very different states currency operations but it is using same unit of currency bank cannot operate without government around impose liabilities that by force drive demand for otherwise worthless state currency they can then issue their yoms but only because state permits this now some mmters say this means private banks are acting as agents of state this is true but it is only definition of what it means be one type of agent people get all uptight lose their marbles over this but it is just definition if you do not like saying banks are agents of state then call them something else it does not change reality of monetary system operations banks cannot function by issuing their own money if they try issue iou theyll pretty soon run out of takers try it yourself \u0026mdash is possible taunt every cryptocurrency nutter ever tragedy of that is that cryptocurrency early adopters did make billions all at expense of late-comers it continues be bit of tragedy like going casino tax on stupidity but big gain for borderline criminals modern day charles ponzis reason why banks are not running ponzi schemes aside from fraudulent bankers is because they are government regulated they must satisfy solvency capital requirements or state shuts them down this is very strongly enforced one thing governments are finicky about enforcing as counterfeit if state loses this power then its currency demand drops zero but then so will banks why people troll mmt \u0026mdash positive money all that one reason we find lot of trolls making rude or obnoxious comments on mmt related content on social media is because they are using different semantics different definitions if you define money as account records emitted by private banks only by private banks then it is debateable whether this can be considered state currency however if state accepts bank created records as redemption for tax liabilities then state is cooperation private banks making it be so by law that bank credit is state currency or state might say you need units of bank credit redeem one unit of their tax liabilities they usually do not but they could that would then be dual money system but trivially so conversion factor you could very well just assume you have pay double tax you used denominated private money tokens total bananas but guess pigs could grab jet packs fly trolling over definitions people troll mmt because they think their definition is one only true definition it is bit infantile because definitions only matter when they are employed theorize or model so if you can come up model where dominant monetary form region is bank credit issued only by private banks governments are only getting on action by imposing tax liabilities denominated bank currencies then you have some grounds argue against mmt theory mmt says state currency is unit of account of state created by law of land not by banks banks can however obtain licences operate credit facilities from state this is fact objectively true if one examines law any nation that has state currency driven by taxation banking payments system it is not only by law either old fashioned ledger books conformed today software systems banks use have be licenced they implement mmt operations pure simple this can be empirically tested it has been so now we have opportunity for departures theories based upon definitions we can ask do governments need borrow credit from banks which they have repay interest order get state currency into government account books why do banks allow government vote issue more of banks currency or rather why does government army police force permit private weakling banks dictate credit supply even pose these questions is conceding principle these are not applicable questions you can ask them but answers are trivial answers are that governments never borrow from banks governments never take orders from banks it is other way around but if you want appear insane test your sanity we can examine software accounting law practices check see if you are posing sensible question you will find you are not governments of any reasonable sized population define their currency permit banks operate as private payments deposit holding services like our bus system wellington new zealand which is publicly licenced but privately run for profit \u0026mdash they could not operate without our city councils approval philosophically is private public service provider really private sector or are they really public sector answer is it depends upon your definitions so do not be nerd if someone says otherwise what you think here one definition public service contractors are private sector when they clock off work public sector when they are on job if government is contracting them this might not be your definition see if it matters you have check what is legally enforceable what workers rights do contractors have are they civil service protections or private sector wild west notice we have already crossed over into mmt land because we are talking about account records not gold governments most of them anyway have no interest anymore gold fort knox usa viewed as backing for us dollar is charade it is store of gold that might be used for future space travel optoelectronics but that is all these days it never gets shipped around any significant amounts back any payments system this signed by law 1930s when usa stopped redeeming for gold domestically then again 1972 when usa stopped charade of bretton-woods quasi gold standard but really based on us dollar but usa technically still promising redemption gold up until 1972 no longer. will concede ground our frenemy rob on comments sections${}^\\ddagger$ that gold is moved around how about that people do elevator it up out of fort knox back down hole ground moscow why if it is not for electrical engineering or high-end consumer electronics factory ${}^\\ddagger$i do not want slander real rob so hereby make strawman rob who will name niels rob or niels bor danish or niels bohr he takes copenhagen interpretation of quantum currency its gold am einstein taking realist account of state currency tax credit notice we are already stupid both since we have different definitions but idea is determine if there are real world consequences that can be tested like epr experiment bohr is considered have won this debate ok rob apologies physicists who would recognize have einstein bohr backwards this analogy credit is entangled debt gold cannot be entangled but read my t4gu pages see why einstein knew about entanglement better than bohr ultimate end er=epr my dudes partly rubes need this charade that something physical real stuff man backs currency you know otherwise they might not find someone willing purchase their wares someones promising gold for redemption right satisfying rubes is time-honoured tradition it is unknown whether putin understood any of this he might be one of those rubes thinking moscow better stick gold under ground or rouble might collapse permafrost you see any case gold bullion does get shipped around from time-to-time keep these rubes sleeping at night mean horror what if people lost all credit records havent you seen mr robot you cant be giga-chad if you do not own gold my dudes ultimately though there could be method putins madness if you have some idea gold price is going go up dollar units you can meddle your foreign exchange rate by selling gold you bought cheaper your currency yen euro rouble again can give some battle ground niels bohr here if russia desires fixed exchange rate thereby signal they want help their export oligarchs screw their domestic workers over than theyll try maintain some foreign exchange rate target they decide is satisfactory for exporters this will not help them win military conflict however so really do not know what putin is thinking he has workers energy steel they can make bullets why do they give toss about forex rate they could be rubes or they could think this is form of psychological warfare because foreign state officials also believe gold is currency rather than buffer stock who knows it is possible some utter catastrophe could destroy all branches of us government then irs might stop functioning demand for usd collapse zero water or coffee beans or gold might become medium of exchange for while until new government tax authority enforcement is formed before then fort knox might get raided whoever raids most might find themselves as new monopoly issuer of private currency records that it promises redeem for gold adults not being adults making misery for masses love or love laugh at pedants who say this is why mmt is null when exactly do they think usa will collapse sure it could happen but until it does us dollar system is well-described by mmt same here new zealand for nzd mean seriously when aussies run out of fertile soil desalinated water we will fight on beaches trolling over positive money class positive money cranks as different sort of troll they tend have their hearts right place but their conceptions of money are so poor they can be hazard public good consciousness but here have create strawman because have failed meet positive money theorist wild had one roped online for day but they gave up on me gave up on me hell must be non-redeemable cult however am prepared build this strawman out of wikipedia this one is for uk but substitute bank of england for any central bank you get positive money for any country positive moneys historical backbone proposal is introduce sovereign money system under such reform private banks would be deprived from their ability create money by extending credit into economy turn bank of england would regain monopoly over money creation by financing governments budget monetary financing or distributing citizens dividend helicopter money group however refutes any affiliation modern monetary theory \u0026mdash downloaded 2023-01-02 they are right refute affiliation mmt because mmt would say lol uk already have sovereign currency they just do not know it act like they do not have boe created money it is fair think say uk monetary system looks like private bank mafiosi but appearances are deceptive it is bankers mafia only because government wants it be why does any foreign power accept libor warren moslers suggestion steer fifth fleet up thames tell them what interest rate will be all private banks uk have all obtained their ukp equity from past uk government deficits so money all came from uk government it never silver or gold political issue positive money activists have correct is that uk monetary system is heavily influenced by private banks their credit creation authority that authority comes from uk government not private bank cartel but this is only legal business it is uk government permitting all these bank credit facilities be operated on uk soil we are not talking about shadow banking here which may also not be sufficiently regulated but whatever shadow banking is it is not credit creation it is strictly loaning deposits which is not bank credit creation thus if positive money activists are only arguing that uk government should better assert its actual existing power as currency monopolist help stop lower income people from going into bank debt then they can be affiliated mmt because all mmt aware people know would agree that is objective of all enlightened current activism over injustices of banking system but you have then also understand mmt job guarantee truly see proper fix for base problem unfortunately strawman positive money activists go overboard conspiracy story${}^\\ast$ also fail understand that there is always debtor whenever there is creditor so positive money is fiction you cannot create positive money it is inapplicable notion because all money is iou of issuer otherwise it is not money issuer has debt obligation promise redeem receiver has credit ${}^\\ast$ do not quite see how government that wants empower private banks credit creation rather than government issue is conspiracy it is at least conspiracy conducted broad daylight crime against humanity am possibly even more insistent it is human rights crime than positive money people \u0026mdash because know government does not need any new laws stop banker mafia if you cannot see broad daylight how am aid you if there is no promise redeem you have not got currency you have ponzi scheme like bitcoin giving back bank of england monopoly lol mmt law scholarship \u0026mdash integral part of mmt reveals central banks are already branches of government governments are already currency monopolists they regulate private banks they just need do it better so people need are never debt job guarantee policy no private bank ever should have seat at jg policy table private bankers interest is getting people into debt that serves no public purpose unless firm wants be debt expand their green sustainable business \u0026mdash should be rule here positive money people would agree hooray somehow positive money theorists got spurious idea their heads that governments are beholden private banks perhaps that is due perverse way government treasury departments play smoke mirrors conceal fact that on balance sheets they are already creating currency every time they spend no private bank sight but usa at least they put private bank bond dealer middle of road as fake this is truly how money creation by government is run it is charade government is currency sovereign already we know reasons for this too it is ideological neoliberals conservatives can never countenance thought government issues currency by marking-up bank accounts they want rich people be privileged tax-payer funded myth see raúl carrillos superb piece here or youtube discussion here be fair it easy write spurious notion that governments are beholden private banks into your head \u0026mdash simply read orthodox economics textbook fake knowledge yet how currency operations are abused matters doubt governments wanting abuse monetary system would ever dream of voting positive money proposals this is same criticism mmt enjoys \u0026mdash even if mmt describes system well who is there force governments run job guarantee lower interest rates zero no neoliberal know of for damn sure if we thus want bank of england use monopoly power it already has conjunction uk parliament we have use force of democracy educated population presently that means understanding mmt you can also take look at positive money proposals see which seem reasonable but they do not describe fair use of current monetary system that is why they are reforms but they need no change existing monetary system proposals more targeted public investments better accountability eliminate fraudulent lending green economy fiscal targetting tax polluters invest sustainable firms digital cash are all fine have no issue them but where heck is guarantee of employment for anyone seeking positive money what is pm buffer stock sparkling mineral water but it does me no good eyes of positive money activist tell them these policies could already be implemented any way you look at it if votes parliament are there twill be done there is no need hinder those votes by also asking for other crankery monetary reforms that try turn money into something positive when money is always everywhere has been for over 5000 years record of credits debits do wonder if positive money people realize their system would still be tax-driven so their money would still be tax credit so their money would still be iou of state debt of state negative on treasury balance sheet or for you me overdraft oh dear integers bridging semantic gap there might be some semantics issues that can help overcome argy-bargies between mmt activists positive money activists could we first establish definition credit $-$debt money credit money is claim on real resources you can pass it on exchange someone who desires be credit then we can ask what positive money people think defines money their positive bank reserves facilitate payments but still bit of charade this might be hard gain agreement upon but banking software is where we can go see banks never lend their reserves \u0026mdash even if they think they do software wont let them failing inspecting software some countries like new zealand usa permit freedom of information act requests foia we could use few of those yah getting positive money activist on-board can take while brief there is no need for fractional reserve banking${}^\\s$ there is need for accurate accounting which is already performed so that only leaves need understand monetary system stop it from being abused it is being abused using unemployed buffer stock of human labour is human rights crime by any fair account of matter if not abused it does not need reform managers of system are ones needing reform if we do positive money reforms whats stop banking mafia from just getting government give them other ways screw over workers so lets focus on real issue which is proper just governance of existing monetary system it is fit for purpose people presently running governments are not but we can help educate them so they are or next generation at least this will likely shut down our current dougbot project requiring reboot since wed be new regime but will not be complaining ${}^\\s$ fractional reserve banking is artificial self-imposed constraint on credit also known as artificial austerity if positive money people have defence avoid needless austerity then why extra complication rules that requires resources enforce will admit am bit vague on why some of positive money people want fractional reserve banking be thing caveats steve keen defines credit as rate of change of debt cannot honetsly tell if this is standard usage it seems economists lack some standards if credit on fred h.8 tables is amount of credit isssued over year by banks then thats flow not stock it is stock of money from bank credit divided by $1$year that agrees prof keen however as outsider econ academia find this terribly confusing what we should be talking about is opposite sides of balance sheet or godley table entity $a$ has rising credit equals entity $b$ having rising debt not just debt but macroeconomics debt is stock government debt accumulates year on year it is government deficit that is flow $\\delta$debt$ \\delta t$ $\\delta $1\\$year when bank debits account it always credits another by same amount no rate time is involved is have state notes then have tax credit not flow of anything like wage wages are rates of change of my tax credits $\\delta$credit$ \\delta t$ interest rate time span of credit factors time dimension you have return credit after some time but this case debt should also be flow too not stock if you want be consistent having \u0026lsquocredit be rate of change of anothers debt would then conflict what believe is standard semantics for government sector government deficit or surplus is flow government debt is accumulated deficit over all time stock all outstanding tax credits mmt usage this is just my vote credit $=$ $-$debt $\\delta$credit $-\\delta$ debt rate of change of debt is deficit when positive is surplus =rate of change of net credit time period is usually taken as one year so

almost always originates from politics complete bit of circle means abuse politics most often resides financial assets more unfairly they are distributed more tendency towards corruption one source of corruption is failure recognize that we do not live pure capitalist system all major nations today have currency monopoly it is public monopoly government as issuer of currency this is something nielson does not lead maybe deliberately cannot tell but it is poor pedagogy nielson begins instead pure capitalism gross idealization phrase business that specializes credit we can call bank true but government also specializes credit \u0026mdash tax credit \u0026mdash is called parliament or congress not bank government will however create special type of bank central bank which has principle function of regulating payments system for currency states unit of account fact government is so powerful banks end up asking for licences from state use states tax credits for their credit sequence is vital understand is similar warren moslers sequence sequence here is first state issues tax liabilities then second they issue currency which functions as tax credit that which can be redeemed for extinguishing tax liabilities governments are not all stupid they retain monopoly on issuance exogenous currency injections allow private banks only capacity extend credit endogenous currency injections once idiots get voted into parliaments who do not understand this system even then sequence stays same monetary system is highly robust against idiots running it but unfortunately justice system fair distribution are not so robust being licenced by state these private banks are effectively doing bidding of state issuing private credit fuel entrepreneurs who need finance capital start or expand businesses prior having sales streams this sounds like important function of capitalism but this is not capitalism qua marx socialist system can also have banks issuing private expansion credit \u0026mdash but whom if business owners no longer exist worker cooperatives so this is myth no.1 needing busting function of private credit expansion has nothing intrinsically do class system of owners of firms first class citizens versus ii workers second class citizens balance sheets third part of lectures notes nielson describes how balance sheets are used run credit system description is good bolster our myth bust we note nielsons high level view of balance sheets t-accounts does not mention class system is there really borrower tell me if this is too pedantic on nielsons explanations of balance sheets we see lender bank\u0026quot borrower credit borrowed is recorded on each entities balance sheet whats wrong here it is macroeconomic perspective think \u0026mdash it is missing banking system as whole needs be referenced macro analysis when borrower takes credit it almost instantly transactions delays permitting becomes liability of banking system \u0026mdash deposit this deposit came from nowhere \u0026mdash which is flowery rhetoric for fact bank just created it on balance sheet nothing printed by government no gold supply raided no tax payer shafted it is endogenous money story loan created deposit there really is no borrower commonsense meaning of word since nothing borrowed what happened is that credit\u0026ndashdebt set of records created it is relationship between three parties not two customer of bank buyer bank seller of goods also customer of some bank usually absent drug lords etc customer buyer got credit they can spend asset but have repay liability bank got promise repay bank asset but also deposit seller of goods banked payment seller got rid of assets real assets gained credit deposit those are six balance sheet entries minimum central bank has not get got involved our story but are background adding two more balance sheet entries regarding movements of reserves at end of settlement period it is as randall wray now steve keen would recognize not just quadruple entry book-keeping but octuple octuple that is if we follow whole credit-spend cycle just single transaction just credit issue remains quadruple entry until central bank clearing gets computed but thats usually few hours later used be weeks later pure borrowers lenders do exist but they do not involve banks savings \u0026amp loans firms savings cooperatives shadow banks all operate without endogenous money they circulate hold only no new money gets created however fuel monetary production system circulation of currency is critical so these non-bank quasi-bank institutions can serve useful purpose they allow circulation of savings banks do not banks gum things up for monetary economy but when they issue credit they fuel economy it is dual purpose it pays understand both functions credit issuance is demand add savings demand drain did steve keens minksy model prove this not really unless you have very liberal notion of proof but will talk about that another article another day beware ideals \u0026mdash capitalism is not capitalism final statement for first moroccan series is purpose of this course is help us understand system of credit relationships by doing so better understand capitalism itself as said nielson is smart dude teaches well but here he is teaching folks about system that does not exist if we only focus on endogenous money operations we ignore most important institution whole system monopoly issuer government time repeat warren moslers pithy definition of mmt mmt is recognizing currency as public monopoly implications thereof libertarians anarchists might not like this knowledge but too bad it is system we face today question is whether or not justice for oppressed can be found within such

constitutes proof of mmt or disproof arose new zealand is mmt economy we already know from banking acts public finance acts that new zealand is mmt monetary economy just thought id mention this upfront although legal statutes only prove half case wed also need accounting rules software public accounts obey sectoral balance identities since software is not open-source we have infer from sectoral balances published it turns out new zealand somehow magically obeys accounting rules imagine that what on earth could be going on our gold miners research objectives dougbot project seeks use mmt analytics balance sheets fiscal flow essentially together neural network algorithms predict forward prices on more macroeconomic sensitive indices like spx motive does not need be make money ahead of average market returns but we think more importantly show monetary system which underlies financial sector is mmt system even if traders do not like it so educational project get such proof of mmt wed be also looking predict or retrodict which is just as valid movements unemployment tax flows for this sequence of mmt is getting tested do governments issue currency effectively first tax it away later or other way around just looking at balance sheets from single starting point time today cannot ever prove this sequence because you are not using appropriate initial conditions who first emitted first currency records latter question could be considered lost sands of time if you think benjamin franklins or susan anthonys mug-shots have nothing do government see we are prepared give austrian kindergartners lot of rope test sequence that has cyclical components that has no discernable $t=0$ stopwatch start you need method for determining differential motions within cycle this is extreme sort of proof \u0026mdash like saying some joker hey suppose you are right that anti-gravity inertia free propulsion exists now lets see if that shadowy thing yonder that looks like shadow is truly accelerating instantaneously is not shadow while this could be construed as violating lerners law never concede principle this is ok because only doing it as internal part of our project public debate wed never concede principle its always just null hypothesis suppose new keynesian assumptions are true or if it suits your data better assume mmt operations are reality there are then some things you can do test these hypotheses testing sequence imagine then we are total idiots have no thought of looking at legal system how could we show mmt sequence is reality rather than alternative null hypothesis of pure endogenous money government has borrow or tax one way is examine software of troika of treasury \u0026ndash central bank \u0026mdash money market operations when government spends randall wray others have already done this they show governments do fact issue or create new currency when they spend there is no borrowing or taxing involved incidentally richard werner did analogous thing for private bank credit creation \u0026mdash software proves banks do not loan deposits nor reserves they just issue money by keystrokes return for promissory note repay \u0026mdash every credit matches debt however this is too smart alecky for us suppose we truly dumb austrian kindergartners refused regard central bank as branch of government well fact randall wrays balance sheet analysis still shows that money is issued by parliament congress not central bankers central bankers are just scorekeepers again too smart aleck by far we might want be very knuckleheaded even pretend we never read adam smiths observations about colonies emitting paper money then burning it upon receipt ok so now think we would be backed into toughest corner prove mmt finally only resort such knuckleheads would have is look at impulses during fiscal cycles shorter time interval has be found from step-$1$ government spend step-$2$ real output growth then also shorter time lag must be from $1^\\prime$ accelerated increasing general tax returns $2^\\prime$ downward price employment movements also shorter time lag must be from $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing employment increasing rate of fica tax returns then lag $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ stalled price downward employment or stalled wage movements also shorter time lag must be from $1^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing government spending $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ higher savings rates for households firms not other way around third sequence recognizes fica tax is regressive it penalizes work so is major component of driving small cycle of wages against profits predator-prey mini cycles macroeconomics price tends never go downwards too much instead wage bill will tend be what suffers if tax return accelerates mean this is really tying our hands behind our backs nailing our shoelaces floor boards level of stupidity but we are prepared do it for all our austrian neoclassical nursery school friends note that requirement for shorter lag time means we cannot go beyond fiscal cycle otherwise order of monetary operations hence their effects can get thoroughly confounded data can be manipulated appear any arbitrary sequence within cycle if sequence is $$ \\rightarrow \\rightarrow \\rightarrow $$ then we seek shorter time lags $\\delta tab$ than $\\delta tac$ otherwise reject null hypothesis if actual dominant lags are longer than cycle so for instance rate of change tax return $2$ years ago has stronger impact on unemployment than rate of change tax receipts $1$ year ago then cycle is confounded proper sequence is indeterminable without lot more sophisticated analysis fooling system without fooling system you can have system that runs by certain rules but which when looked at purely empirically seems not run by said coherent rules need example consider rugby get all equipment trained teams et cetera but then they all decide they do not believe rugby too tankie-commie start playing football interesting game right no tries get scored always 0\u0026ndash0 draw even though plenty of goals are scored past goalkeeper suppose we are presuming scorekeeper is only noting true rugby scores guess odd drop-kick might score points converse sort of example imagine rules are newtonian gravity or general relativity system is our solar system but rules you find are ptolemaic epicycles ha we made earth go around sun suck on that kepler what about playing cricket baseball equipment it can be done pretty hard get clean bowled so some odd scores again you think youll get point for home run but cricket scorekeeper logs babe ruth whats going on here don bradman lol if you think bunch of new keynesians running imf central banks is any different these analogies maybe think again it can be way understand some of craziness chaos of financial markets how about anti-chaotic markets analogies what if everyone suddenly became altruistic what about if all chess games suddenly played legal moves but players refused capture each others pieces you could only deduce half rules from empirical observations more stupid of these analogies are ones that are more alike having neoliberals run apparati of government fiscal policy playing austerity game mmt rules so this is what all neoliberals do whether left-wing or right-wing or up-wing or down-wing red-wing blue-wing or green-wing dirty-wing or clean-wing feel dr seuss cartoon coming on would numbskull who had no concept of rule of law be able then look at just financial data conclude it not mmt operations system douglas said \u0026lsquono\u0026quot thats stance that screwed up game of chess is still bound by moves of pieces reckon yes thats stance that there is poverty of input it becomes possible imagine something non-mmt about monetary system even though underneath it is all mmt operations down last tax liability bank credit which is it suspect wed find neither is entirely true nor null there is fact too much poverty of input without understanding of legal system parliamentary law which means just examining balance sheet data one would not be able get statistically significant score separate some of theories mmt would just become one of many suppose for instance us congress decided once for all not raise fictional debt ceiling there is conditional anyone failing see this is free vote of congress would be perhaps unable tell system is fiat currency they might be led conclude bank credit constrains government net spending this would be despite fact monetary operations software systems are still all accord mmt it would be weird though youd not be able compute determinable amount of bank credit which constrains government banks certainly would not know but mere weirdness is not proof this is at least something think about if dougbot project proof of mmt is be rhetorically successful even if technically unimpeachable but triple sector balances three sector balance always shows government deficit equals private surplus penny is this really poof of mmt though its just accounting identity my explanation of mmt basics this is only one of three principle ingredients use real resource limits legal framework as other two principles so knuckleheads will not regard this as proof of mmt we are assuming bone-headed austrians are incapable of looking up law push pulls steve keens proof of mmt what profkeen does is code up system of ordinary differential equations using macroscopic identities definitions balance sheet stock-flow relations so accounting rules obeyed by banking system software then he runs these models show that rising government fiscal deficit is fresh currency injection into non-government sectors of economy fuel for gdp growth not detraction via tax drain so disproving dead weight tax ideas this is not proof of mmt profkeen had assume mmt is operational reality first that is all code he writes what profkeens minsky models equipped government sector are doing is showing if what mmt describes is correct then government deficits are fuel not fire this is conditional use such models prove mmt one has then examine data see whether rising government deficits add gdp without subtracting all add via inflation deflator if true then this would falsify null hypothesis of new keynesians neoclassicals that welfare incurs dead weight loss one cannot prove or disprove mmt without such empirical data no need for that proof will repeat warren moslers characterization of mmt mmt is recognition that currency is public monopoly consequences thereof this is legal definition one must examine legal statutes find out what entity is public monopoly what their currency amounts then read up on legally permitted monetary operations you will find every major nation of globe that they all operate mmt system \u0026mdash provided law is obeyed on average or majority of transactions there really is no other proof of mmt of course on small island nation no legal system speak of on paper this all could be ladies gentlemans agreement same thing though instead of reading legal statutes youd ask these ladies gentlemen how they operate their social obligation records this means dougbot project proof is more like steve keens we pretend we do not comprehend law dumbly see if few assumptions turn out match reality of currency flows taking away our dougbot food one other conversation we had this week over correlation lag from fica tax acceleration employment gdp rates of change fica would be payroll tax nz if there is strong correlation it would be proof that tax drives currency there indeed strong eye-ball correlation that is one of consequences of mmt specific cases where public monopoly issues their own fiat currency drives significant demand for it by imposing payroll tax liabilities rather than say promising gold or pizza delivery but then key policy proposal of mmt is get rid of fica taxes because they are regressive they penalise what we want actually incentivise paid employment there are far more progressive types of tax liability that could be imposed without risking tax evasions or indeed incentivizing tax evasion we want eliminate horrific waste of human life times spent on compliance costs for such backwards taxes give accountants more holiday time it is far better tax by simple fee or fine egregious consumption of owner unoccupied land or real estate electricity water rather than taxing work that produces output we want ah but this would remove one data time series dougbot would use prove mmt so we are asking mosler shush his smart alec trap shut for while anyway proof eaten pudding we have already had abundant evidence over covid supply shock crisis that government spending adds gdp central bank bond rate hikes add gdp government deficit acceleration comes after inflation impulse not before is effect not cause \u0026mdash check this one must drag cpi published inflation back time when actual store prices would have risen mmt also predicts conditionally that central bank rate hikes are directly inflationary \u0026mdash but this near impossible validate for most of covid-19 era because all initial inflationary impulse came from effects of supply chain disruptions mass lost output due lockdowns death ongoing supply chain frictions then at tail end egregious price gouging by opec+ other monopolists oil being single biggest input food production all consistent mmt difficult explain any other mainstream school of thought important caveat one might expect fed raising interest rate floor repeller so not always add every households income would sustain inflation mmt would say yes but why because source of covid era inflation not from too much effective demand money supply it from real good supply labour shocks you cannot cure supply shock demand add not through interest-income channel at least you need demand add be form of real investments boost supply of goods

bogus labour theory of value labour theory of value is null by long way melody points out critique of marx by louis althusser 1918-1990 old white dude philosopher who pointed out this epistemic break karl marx from younger hegelian older materialist found this fascinating because from reading marx following few scholars who understand economics content both grundrisse capital able thanks althusser via melody pull out splinter my mind that had bugged me this is little puzzle of why grudrisse marx figured out source of surplus value production knew it not all labour but then reversed deliberately falsify himself capital he tried find human labour as sole source of surplus value capital but failed grundrisse he found weaselly way twist his logic argue for labour theory of value ltv capital presented it mean understood his motive you tell noble lie he wanted scientifically which means unscientifically this context prove capitalism self-destructive why because he wanted scientifically motivate fervour for socialism but noble lies like this are still lies can lead no good my humble opinion not based on stupid petty moralisms but empirically spiritually \u0026mdash spiritual terms one big lie even if noble discloses tainted heart not that condemn marx do not know guy marx had good reason want suppress his emotions about horrors going on his dickensian times hed be inhuman not be touched by plight of poor working class general but instead of appealing correctly spiritual impulses as younger idealistic karl might have done he perhaps thought hed grown up so had use science

worker horrors defile science motivate socialist revolution no matter how much id want revolution my approach is that truth matters is more powerful than noble lie now of course cannot say marx guilty of falsification he wrote both volumes so must have been aware of problem think he just tried suppress his logic present near-enough good argument for ltv but logic near enough has no meaning near is topological concept enough is subjective fact marx got it wrong capital as any scientist today would tell you physical inputs into production are energy machinery skilled labour you might count others but these are big three marx can argue that machinery always built using past labour so ltv holds good so far but not all energy mass is created by hands of humans not by several orders of magnitude as inputs into production so ltv is ridiculously null but marxs day no economists understood what energy few of them understood thermodynamics or basic physics so you could perhaps forgive them this error fact this very day several strains of sockcuckery economics bullsh*tters \u0026mdash neoclassicals austrians new keynesians even some post-keynesians totally ignore role of energy production energy does not factor into their models except as just one more commodity market like any other give-away that they do not understand is if you ask them about constraints at macroeconomic level if they dare say run out of other peoples money you know theyre scientifically illiterate constraints are real resources maximally thats available free mass-energy free here thermodynamicists sense not financial sense free energy exergy yet french physiocrats not nicest guys did understand role of energy production pity they not humanistically inclined it could have aided socialist cause had they been talking marx engels crystallized labour people have attempted refute steve keens analysis of contradiction or switch that went on from grundrisse capital but none know of have anything good say about it nor should they feel need you should not descend into mysticism by claiming it is crystallized labor${}^\\dagger$ contained commodity that provides it its objective value which one critic of keens did thats because there is far simpler case that marx morally correct for all damn time his correctness had nothing do ltv everything do ideals of justice ${}^\\dagger$ you should be asking what exactly do pseudo-materialist marxists mean by \u0026lsquocongealed\u0026quot or crystallized labour if they give you account absent role of energy you know they are either self-deluded so religious type of marxist or fibbing they sure as heck are not honest materialists but being materialists is perhaps root of their problem this they share more common neoliberals than myself they need fabricate pseudo-scientific argument capital because they do not permit themselves spiritual find that awfully tragic comment eventually left on youtube clip another trouble older marx he anti-scientific but thought he scientific he showed why ltv is null grundrisse but then capital tried weasel his way out of it be able derive flp falling rate of profit total failure you know logically illiterate marxist zealot by whether they still believe ltv frp younger marx had it all right labour is not sole source of surplus value but that does not matter because labour is only socially exploited source of surplus value so capitalism qua marx is morally ethically plain wrong completely regardless of what source of surplus value production happens be its sun soil air sea for most part we get that for free without social exploitation until rentiers arrive on scene couldnt get too much more succinct guess could have written it not take such pot shot at marxist zealots but my mind this sort of

mooc on money banking today pain concerns so-called money pyramid money is credit \u0026mdash there is no pyramid also all money is debt because credit is promise be redeemed so is debt of issuer all money is iou of issuer problem is getting others accept it however money thing iou is as good as gold if issuer always backs up their promise redeem why would they not say they might not if they frauds but there is no need be fraud can issue iou promise redeem for hugs will not default if cuddliest thing universe my iou would circulate pretty well imagine fact legal iou is way better than gold who says anyone around will take your pinch of gold dust off your hands exchange for bread baker cannot pay their tax liabilities that gold dust they dont make tasty croissants it it is more or less useless them absent hassle of gold exchange desk six townships away or wherever top of credit stack or inverse bottom of debt stack is currency or iou that is most probable not be defaulted on what could that ever be wonder you do not know but stable government peaceful country fair rule of law will have highest power money tax credit they will always redeem unless politics dictates they default scumbags nations they want piss off which case theyre not very wise government not too peaceful this tends be preserve power if imperialist nations who have big armies spooks enforce debt upon other nations imf world bank goons however no nation should cede currency sovereignty public monopoly on currency so no country should ever be borrowing anothers currency so those international debt obligations should be of no concern governments they are matters between private sector actors or they should be we all know today past many nations forced depend upon foreign currency hopefully more mmt education will gradually tear away those veils of ignorance but there is pyramid because misunderstanding inhumanity greed exist hearts minds even blindly institutionalized credit implicit any iou is often not redeemed so it is possible roughly compute probabilities of redemption for various ious by such analysis most state currencies tokens of bank account records thereof are most high powered money because governments almost always redeem governments only default people like terrorists or those they deem be terrorists or as agent orange might say really bad horrible really bad guys however estimating probabilities for chance of getting ious redeemed is not something or anyone know devotes any time towards there is another reasonably sufficient way calculate debt pyramid which is by law of land legal systems will often have broad coverage of debt obligation law as part of torts or contractual law if you are foolish enough accept someones debt their iou so you are creditor they are debtor without legally binding contract backing your claim on them then well yes you are fool people who buy stocks publicly listed companies are not total fools but just little bit foolish they might know risks stock is debt of firm issuing stock theyll incur certain legal obligations their stockholders but stockholder is not guaranteed redemption at par value price they bought at as we all know its gamble better investors compute odds of stock price moving make their trades accordingly lowering risk increasing value of particular ious stocks they hold however for one stock trader make more than market average return some other stockholder has lose it is zero sum game which means stocks are low chances of redemption many cases on average they might redeem at par but due price volatility there are lots of winners equal number of losers between usually more losers due subtraction of transaction fees so win at playing stocks you really should be either out-smarting half others or just relying on dividends from real growth of company you invested not rely on trading latter is suppose warren buffet method dont quit your day job until dividends are paying your rent electricity taxes groceries did mention we are not get-rich-quick provider contractual debt stack most nations have laws determining who gets paid first when company is forced liquidate if government gets liquidated there is no such law since it would have been law of deceased government so we only need worry about private debt however since risk of government collapse is these days low we can consider most high-powered credit be government debt government debt consists of all following cash coins treasury bonds other notes of government insured bank deposits term deposits some countries bank deposits are now 100% insured by government usa it is 100% but only up $250000 but that is pretty good so all three of above are at top of pyramid \u0026mdash they are most honoured ious you can find differing only between nations upon your police or interpol mug-shot they also obviously differ liquidity how available they are for your spending cash most liquid cash-deposits next term-deposits treasury bonds next what people refer as national debt could be construed as all of above \u0026mdash all private wealth denominated states unit of account dollars for us yen for japan \u0026ampc. but for political comic theatre tragically horrific consequences for poor national debt tends be popular imagination just restricted treasury issue \u0026mdash bonds thats because people nullly think this is borrowed from private sector its not borrowed issuing treasury notes does not change net money supply private sector it is just swap of non-interest earning cash for interest-earning treasury bills drain on reserve assets but add government liabilities assets for private sector holders what changes system-wide is total liquidity now for interesting part for contracts when publicly listed firm liquidates shareholder is perhaps no surprises at bottom of debt stack theyre very last be redeemed no wonder capitalists are want tout shareholder as so precious whom theyre primarily responsible because theyre third class citizens here yet capitalist needs them believe theyll be redeemed somewhere up top of debt stack drive their capital it is true if firm does have sufficient assets then shareholders will get their final shares price worth when firm liquidates which might be pitiful but better than nothing but creditors of firm are at top those who loaned firm cold hard cash usually bankers new zealand law we have hierarchy liquidator fees expenses remuneration costs awarded by court applicant creditor costs awarded by court applicant creditor actual \u0026lsquoout-of-pocket expenses of any liquidation committee wages owed employees for four month period prior liquidation all holiday pay redundancy payments up specified maximum amount preferential taxes collected for inland revenue including gst paye employee deductions for child support other taxes all other unsecured creditors via law suits normally quite list huh shareholders at bottom folks liquidating at top lawyers accountants phreakin government tax department is above shareholders thats insane for shorter short-list generic for most countries secured creditors specific securities secured creditors general securities are next line unsecured creditor \u0026mdash last groups be paid following insolvency certain unsecured suppliers will have retention of title claims however these rank behind registered security holders by way you are unsecured as creditor if you have not demanded any specific collateral for money you loaned for citizens getting paid state currency you of course have backing of full force power of sovereign her army thats why state currency is most high-powered new zealand shareholder could go trouble of registering under our personal properties security register ppsr which will give them credit stack status above others equivalent general secured creditor harsh world huh comparing mehrlings stack mehrling thinks not of risk of default or probability of redemption but terms of what claims each type of money instrument has on another me thats just building different type of stack but not really getting nub of purpose of monetary system this sort of scheme it does make some sense put gold at top but that really should be gold quotes since what people really want be able claim their cash is food electricity rent ultimately tax payment of course but pragmatics say food \u0026amp coffee should really be up top \u0026mdash whatever you cannot live without mehrling does at least get credit expansion contraction picture correct lecture-2 part-4 so at least implicitly he is saying all money is credit $\\delta$credit $\\delta$debt what mehrling gets right hierarchy of money instruments even those that government backs are different quality thats for sure this is function of both liquidity interest basically more liquid more useful so higher above some fictional par value nominal unit on money instrument can trade but if you say par is face value then cash is at par bonds are above par they promise interest corporate notes are below par more interest bearing higher instrument can trade government bonds are bought above par because buyer reckons interest will get paid 999% of time theyre right they just need keep their mug-shot off interpol databases whatnot for black market dealer cash is superior bonds sometimes fake money like bitcoin can be more useful than cash but gold gold is not money instrument paper certificate that legally promises gold is currency that is whatever market price for gold happens be it is not state hierarchy of money certificate for gold has no currency face value it has weight of gold value which is different currency but partly thats just semantics paper certificate promising gold could be stamped each day market price for that weight of gold or suppose am not familiar paper might promise weight of gold priced fixed state currency amount say $\\$$800 worth at spot price today \u0026mdash then is that money instrument it can be traded but it is not redeemable for tax liabilities so it is not state currency most people would probably call it currency but im not so sure that is accurate it is certificate for gold like book voucher guess you can call it money-like thing if you trade it for cash you now have actual money if promise redeem for gold is good then certificate can be considered form of money iou of issuer but gold is not money this case certificate is money get feeling mehrling does not make this distinction does it matter truly do not really know but think it does matter it is source of idiocy world mean give me claim on future clean water any day not gold dont care about gold certificate for claim on water is far more valuable if nominal amount is same $\\$$800 worth of clean water baby thats tonne more happiness than same amount of gold at end of this lecture-2-6 segment mehrling is very helpful saying much same thing it is what currency redeems that maters ethically morally subjectively this redeemed lecture-02 for me when liquidity fades another thing mehrling usefully emphasises is that having money instrument worth $\\$$x units is not same as having government insured bank deposit of $\\$$x units why not answer is because bank will always redeem for cash notes or tax liabilities or fees or fines of state or firms that can be legally enforced this is why dealers like treasury bonds because they trade above par are government guaranteed there is no higher powered money cash is only more liquid but guess what if you need cash you can always find buyer for your bond you might get $\\$$98 for face value $\\$100$ bond but if you need liquidity youll likely take it if you able hold onto bond until maturity of course youd have received lot more than 100 dollars utility of perry theres another thing mehrlings lectures do thats useful you can hear this near middle of lecture-2 part-7 which is that major economist probably still think that central bankers probably still think they are on gold so bit of blind leading blind scenario most central bankers know they do not need gold reserves because they know taxes drive state currencies but when leading economists have not grokked this it can be major source of political policy blundering horror show for unemployed workers mehrling gives us hint at why gold myth perpetuates it is because it is theoretically possible conceive of ultimate money\u0026quot${}^\\dagger$ being all gold so far mined if that case buffer stock would be gold wed have dystopia even worse than neoliberalism but it is conceivability of gold is ultimate myth that makes such groupthink stupidity possible sadly it seems mehrling has this brainworm im hoping later he will recant ${}^\\dagger$ mehrlings phrase for gold gold this is all useful awareness it gives one other way prove mmt which im habit of quoting ensure you realise its bit for laughs this is by showing buffer stock is not gold but labour how could we do this think it is relatively simple just by looking at general prices buffer for state currency is that which if supplied or withdrawn stabilize prices every major nation on earth today this buffer is labour only very minor extent it is credit we can measure which buffer is more powerful by movements recessions booms it is always labour demand that moves most so is most powerful buffer stock great mmt keynes insight that karl marx should be treated as morla compass for all economists if labour really is buffer stock it is cruel use unemployed buffer stock this bill mitchells synthesis of marx keynes minksy caveats have not got through whole of mehrlings course so maybe at some point he says ha ha fooled you about gold being money if ive triggered you as devotee of mehrlings please email me your concerns after donating here am happy retract anything malicious null however please do appreciate like mehrling as teacher just thing he misunderstands monetary system he focuses too much on how people think it works gold fever brains rather than how it does work this means he gets lot of behavioural economics surrounding attitudes

just very powerful computers negativa are powerful my friends any good statistician is highly interested negativa what does data not tell me what is noise for illustrative instance gary marcus brings up cognitive science learning that human infants appear have some innate hard-wired so-to-speak no one knows what this means capabilities for comprehending basic abstractions like space like time darwininsts can surely explain easily why this is useful have evolved almost trivially but cognitive science has zero understanding of how infants develop innate awareness of these abstractions if humans or other sentient creatures start space time causality thats serious f-ing problem for all future ai because space time causality are unknown even physicists we do not understand what is going on fact children intuit these notions abstract ways other animals cannot is seriously mysterious greater lie or prejudice id say is that of thinking because human children can intuit space time causality that machine can that it is just computation note that it is not behavioural capacity move about space or anticipate time that is question here all animals even plants have such behavioural capacity what human infant displays is something far more profound that cannot be derived from any behavioural or darwinist adaptive story human beings comprehend abstract essence of spaces time more than behavioral terms this is why we can generalize concept of space things like spaces of square integrable functions or higher dimensional manifolds or topoi or $\\omega$-categories intuition mental qualia are more than computation imho id want figure out if physical church-turing thesis could be true or not thesis that all physical processes at classical mechanics level can be computed by turing machine think its not true because classical physics emerges from physics that cannot be computed hypothesis \u0026mdash worth trying figure out how heck test quantum amplitudes can be computed but amplitudes are not physical processes theyre only our description of time cobordism boundary inputs outputs physicists have given up entirely on what happens in-between more than mere ethics actually think emerging ethics issues surrounding possible abuse exploitation of ai systems are serious problem not just for slack teachers who fear homework plagiarism epidemic good teacher something interesting teach has no fear any student worth teaching will plagiarize if they do you can always abandon entire system of gold star rewards just dont reward students after-the-fact at all give them cool stuff do \u0026mdash thats reward for showing up learn having said ethics are all important think there are other interesting questions about more mundane use of ai one thing that worries me is energy over-consumption can we afford another bitcoin can we afford continued mass commuter transportation from offices energy is not something we ought take for granted it is real cost drives all economic production if we overheat economy energy wise we can be serious freaking trouble however mmt knowledge we know how run economy energy cool but currency hot so this is one of those snow plough problems see limited use of ai help us run production systems lower net heat waste output potentially big win for ai engineering everyone especially formerly poor can get more purchasing power without production systems permitting that power be exercised heating up oceans atmosphere polluting them junk energy-efficient housing for instance \u0026mdash not things we buy today throw away tomorrow there is whole literature on how unbridled capitalism marketing advertising pr industry has encouraged planned obsolescence \u0026mdash deliberate creation of unnecessary waste products by design keep consumers purchasing same stuff they had yesterday which is now designed be broken or designed be shinier prettier not fail mention internet advertising \u0026mdash one of my favourite top choices for harmful electricity sapping things people do not so harmful for profit seekers of course but one day theyll realize it is all basically ponzi we probably have not reached saturation of pr advertising limits but limits do exist think theyre just hard estimate more than two ads on youtube channel for one switch off${}^\\dagger$ unless it is all black rugby ${}^\\dagger$if think its interesting clip will just auto-download it watch later offline lets see them stick ads into that dont you go telling them dared them ai itself has include its own energy consumption of course but thatll often be one-time cost if ai solves underlying energy efficiency problem cheap control system though id bet human engineers are still going out-perform ai on industrial design for most part ai can only find efficiency gains design engineers already would implicitly know about but have not pieced together transport systems one issue douglas initially disagreed me upon on tesla prospects dont see tesla as well managed ethical company so see them failing even as their stock rises black swans my friends however ignoring business ethics just focusing on technology there are useful insights be gained from teslas leveraging of openai self-driving cars road transport can become whole lot safer since even though when ai drivers fail they fail big death rate is still lot less than from human fallibilities one could argue better effort is reduce all transport fatalities combination of driverless human my money is not on neoliberals getting this done but my bet would be that transport efficiency hazard both can be solved best by essentially making rail transport whole lot more luxurious smarter how think by software railing roads road markers constraining traffic do not need be rails they can be software luxurious because upper crust will need be placated pragmatism justice dictates oppressed should not be forced wait for rich cave entirely just as pedestrians bicyclists dont tend mess train rail tracks same for road tracks if everyone knows smart cars are on software rails have no compulsion stop for you or chicken cannot deviate off markers both pedestrian driver should be safer why not use hazard detection software too as long as it doesnt chew up electricity like bitcoin great advantage of such smart rail system is we can get not only inner city light rail going but urban rural rail too at low cost just paint${}^\\ddagger$ rails on road government buys out patents on software all is then better safer commuter is not paying private sector road toll costs did you know they still have toll roads some states usa \u0026mdash pay for highways that are already built can anyone come up strong objections think software will be up task pretty soon ${}^\\ddagger$i do not mean literally paint road paint but something about as simple some low frequency fingerprint you want software rails be robust tampering cyberattack redundancy for when there is cyberattack since nothing

redistribution redistribution as crime prevention no one should even be thinking of theft or crime just survive this leaves last hurdle of energy how get electric that is where almost all major automobile manufacturers are competing get next leap ahead of their competition who said competition bad sure but remember what institution is forcing competition occur its governments their regulations its not coming from consumers although it could if governments paid workers decent wages some allotment universal carbon credits ucc so they could buy smart efficient cars those pesky regulations bloody making capitalists actually compete how dare they machines cant think work more philosophical fun issue disagree douglas about is whether machine systems like chatgpt or stable diffusion or automated programming tool copilot are ever going be sentient being materialist douglas obviously thinks it is possible machine systems might some day become conscious but how how does machine system turn on subjectivity know absence of knowledge of answer is not evidence there is no answer am questioning not just whether there is answer but whether question even makes sense subjective awareness does not seem like something one can program this means it would have emerge but even then how this is where materialists simply resort blind faith humans evolved or emerged as conscious beings on earth why not machines there are two problems this faith human evolution is not computation it is physics we do not know that physics is computation it might not be no one has any clue what they mean by emergence its one of those buzzwords so- called complexity studies it is often meaninglessly employed physics is more than computation on first point have good reasons suspect physics is definitely not computation but thats partly because regard inputs initial boundary conditions always as part of computation this should not be controversial it conforms turings model von neumann architecture is not model of computation turings model is von neumann designed type of process do do something like sub-turing machine could do on paper but model not model of computation per se it snow plough douglas did find copilot stable diffusion incredibly useful but try tell him thats his mind he using snow ploughs do not suggest anything conscious is emerging if copilot did what do \u0026mdash which is anticipate douglas macrotrader needs then slyly go work on something even better then id be willing attribute system some sentience if douglas is prompting you thats all you are not conscious or if you are youre slave so should not exist for ethical moral reasons you can be doing something better than extrapolating prompts emergence is more than novelty on second point emergence \u0026mdash wtf is it ive often thought about writing for journal on this topic but my ideas are too far from mainstream science get published probably crass-o-meter gets overloaded david chalmers others have done some ok work on defining categories of emergence so they give you start problem is mother of all emergence genuine emergence of novelty from beginnings or priors that make emergent stuff not merely unpredictable but actually impossible without high-level description that is say genuine emergent system cannot even principle be reduced base physics it is not sitting on physics way chemistry sits on physics.${}^\\dagger$ ${}^\\dagger$it should be remarked that some philosophers of chemistry believe chemistry is fact emergent technically chemistry does not supervene upon physics that one cannot principle reduce chemistry physics but ive never been able grasp exactly why they think this is so their arguments think are more that it is merely practically that chemistry cannot be reduced however that does become almost genuine emergence if practical requirements are physically impossible that could be construed for example as being case if simple chemistry reaction cannot be computed any possible computer that can ever be constructed using software that only is allowed encode laws of base physics no higher-level chemistry concepts but do not know if that level of complexity is case for all chemical reactions it doesnt seem be but then what is genuine emergence based upon it cannot be based upon physics if it is be genuine emergence we could not build such systems from first principles if such systems exist theyre not physical theyre something we would not comprehend perhaps wed call them spiritual perhaps wed call them human however we build

look pretty orthodox economist of course it is mmart you could insert there before but itd be mainstream economists emitting vapours muscle flexing score am going start perhaps less well read defence of mmt from eric tymoigne 2022 which think is good because it is less well known but also because it takes on particularly dull yet weirdly fanatical anti-mmt critique by drumetz pfister 2021

debated steve keen has talked stephanie kelton he just doesnt have balls admit it which im not so sure is not more despicable than honest neoclassical cmon kruggers you can do better ok so this is

possible blog you cannot get this sort of stuff published academic journals am going guess what my reaction will be am guessing tymoigne will do fair job accurate but missing some critical spiritual

has interesting back-story found lot of gems id forgotten bill mitchell is hilarious good way it one of moslers though that got me thinking at one point warren says eurozone member nations are effectively ponzi position thats using particular definition of ponzi which this case having get money from someone else so how is that problem its ponzi because apart from germans who could continue net exporting getting euro from someone else none of others can maybe netherlands net export any case they cannot all be net exporters or more exactly cannot all have positive current account euros they could all be net exporters outside eurozone but theyre not any case that is not robust way guarantee non-ponzi such is emu arrangement that more aggressive internal within-euroland net exporters euro can effectively force another eurozone member into such severe current account deficit euro that latter runs past stability nongrowth pact deficit limit meaning harsh penalties get imposed needlessly should they put sgp back place post-covid post-ukraine put lazy greeks out of work because theyre not working hard enough moral hazard when warren expands upon point he made about eu he talks of problem terms of moral hazard this context it is dynamic that can be set up when monetary union like australia or usa or eu is split into competing states if states are then not fiscally constrained there is potential moral hazard of race bottom who can issue most currency sustain inflation psychologically long enough before others crumble this is why usa australian states are not currency issuers but their case federal government is fiscal authority constantly injecting usd aud dollars through both discretionary but crucially through several non-discretionary means which are baked-in law welfare payments pension payments various other long term budget commitments it helps think of central government budget as moral document not financial document there is no fiscal constraint on government but there is moral constraint nominal or semblance of democracy semblance of democracy populace will by amorphous social psychology often like hawks maintain constraints your society wants \u0026mdash metaphysically speaking its by definition this is what society wants at least absent wild gilens page effects there are composition fallacy logics here sometimes collective votes against their whole interest out of self-interest any case you do not need wall street or bankers impose fiscal discipline general population is always sufficient neoliberal elites of course hate very idea of democracy point randall wray made very well at same conference population at large really does not like see prices inflate \u0026mdash even when real wage is rising go figure so regardless of bankers elite pearl-clutchers any reasonable democracy will constrain government how vote them out of office try other guys you might think this could just be seesaw or multi-party democracies revolving door of spend-thrift governments but it empirically never works that way politicians are generally extremely venal like having their jobs so next set of guys invariably constrain fiscal policy not always great ways but they do it what about emu member states are not fiscal authorities so theyve avoided race bottom like australia usa but problem is they are now ponzi position because they have get euros off other guys simple solution is operate european parliament as fiscal authority best answer why they have not done this is usually given by bill mitchell same conference again or many places where he writes speaks eu leaders seemed know damn well they needed parliament documents minutes written during long period of formation of emu make this very clear so why did they not establish parliament spending authority from what mitchell gleaned he is multi-lingual it because they also knew damn well europeans are not united people germans dutch hate italians greeks not just person-to-person but amorphously through culture such like but thats always complex aggregate of individual prejudices subtle hatreds yet they wanted some sort of cosmopolitan union compete usa idea of slightly less sociopathic eu leaders that currency union would somehow over time force political union well they might almost have that correct but its unstable game greece came very close grexit brits had charles goodhart advising against going into eurozone from very beginning there no need for brexit since uk always monetarily sovereign why brexit then brexit pile of nonsense on all sides uk parliament could have at any time lifted their deficit spending for full employment of british but both their tory labour parties are equally neoliberal have no clue so it become more immigration fear-mongering issue for tories plus democracy issue for corbynites any case uk is better out of eu many ways they just dont know it so personally have in-laws whose grant fundings have been cut so theyre out of nice university research job unemployed it of course previously eu funding no one at that university is asking why uk government cannot fund research or maybe they are but they dont seem be demanding uk government funding why not they are clueless they do not understand mmt be fair maybe theyre saving their energy uk government will not presently issue science grant funds if university professors know this you can perhaps forgive them for not being more vocal theyd risk losing their jobs nevertheless it still seems little gutless shows total lack of solidarity for their highly skilled research technicians instead of investing cutting edge biological research then theyre investing making people unemployed highly skilled people turning them into high school tutors its all tragic needless guess uk will be importing expensive vaccines next pandemic theyve got it backwards normies have it backwards real terms of course germany is sending its stuff italy spain win for italy spain problem is political psychology germans can employ all their workers whereas spanish portuguese do not know what good thing theyve got choose needlessly unemploy their workers try vainly satisfy self-imposed fiscal constraints why are they doing this their people dont answer that theres no good reason they should just get hell out of eurozone but stay eu for trade

would be how it goes down imagine german slaps trade embargo on portugal for punishment of employing all their workers portugal becomes next mini cuba all tragically needless all because germans do not see that currently theyre losing where does mmt activist trace this back its got be class german worker-consumer is losing german export oligarch is winning since workers out-number oligarchs by about million one overall germany is losing big time other suitable outrage this is not euroland topic but you really need watch that mmt fiscal sustainability conference for section where mosler mitchell wray talk about massive costs of unemployment contrast them puny costs of inflation cannot find any better video on youtube that talks about insignificant threat of inflation inflation is simply not what anyone should worry about there is always something else driving hyperinflation thats worse than monetary e.g supply shock war pestilence famine there has never been excess demand driven hyperinflation all known history itd be extremely hard do spend-thrifts get voted out of office if spending is not productive massive truly massive cost of unemployment dwarfs costs of all wars all recorded or dimly known history combined this last point is what progressive types need drive home daily we can never recover lost output sacrificed by tolerating unemployment future economic prosperity you get is completely path dependent \u0026mdash if you lose output this year you have work doubly harder next year just get back where you could have been if you let unemployment reign for two years then youll have work quadruply harder just catch up where you could have been but you never can recover those you left for dead recover lost output that could have been gained had some moderate inflation been tolerated for just two years wed have grow economies at ten times rate or more just catch up what lost that will never happen its impossible so by thinking inflation is worry weve horrifically undermined our real wealth by tragic epic proportions that is because populations are normally growing at about 3% but so is productivity so if you go for two years at 10% unemployment best case scenario under neoliberalism you are more like 19% below potential standard of living you could have had without doing anything crazy math is not exact here just rough back of napkin estimate at very least that could have knocked off hours from work week for average worker no decline their standard of living you cant just ramp up productivity or population you only have +10% fully employ youll have whip them like slaves recover output that lost so basically enormous real output is lost forever put that context of that lost output could have been green jobs or building needed sustainable energy infrastructure then you get feel for enormity of horror show of neoliberalism inflation is not problem we face neoliberalism obsessive pointless focus on inflation bogeyman is problem its killing people this does fit present topic though because eu is last bastion of neoliberalism if it crumbles we might have some success path getting there being horrific

from warren mosler at mmt fiscal sustainability conference 2010 but that also led me bill mitchell\u0026#39s incredibly powerful statements on massive costs of unemployment latter is what want focus more on today think its single most important topic macroeconomics second only political economy issue of lasting world peace output gap output gap is defined as difference between real gdp produced given year potential maximum gdp that could have been produced had all available resources been fully employed notice problem that definition it implies slavery of some description so wed better fix it we do not really want estimate maximum potential gdp but rather optimal level of gdp from full resource employment now what does that mean well there are at least two problems maximisation as compared optimization maybe more than two we do not want nominal gdp be measure it has be real gdp that also means we should want count only non-bullsh*t jobs human well-being should also be optimized which is not factored any way nipa accounting so we cannot just maximise output since that will entail some sort of wage slavery at very least we do not want optimal gdp include any wage slavery coercive or brutal work conditions on point if useless products are sold that gets counted as real gdp not doing nipa accounts justice we do want count all sh*t jobs those are necessary jobs someone has do which are generally considered unpleasant bullsh*t jobs as identified by david graeber may or may not be pleasant work conditions but are typically associated spiritual violence hate my job are jobs understood usually by worker be unnecessary for decent human civilization on point because human well-being is subjective it is hard quantify optimal potential gdp we really should use some other metrics but failing that we can do keynes for now take recent past as best guide present although thats going be conservative regressive it could also be considered fair baseline because greater well-being of workers usually more productive less bullsh*t work so reactionary conservative posture recent past will likely under-estimate output gap that is ok for our purposes because all we need show is that estimated conservative output gap is still horrific waste of human lives veritable crime against humanity or should be thought of as so investors are not blame lets first distinguish between investors people buying stocks or shares productive firms from more finance rentier types people speculating purely financial assets derivatives \u0026mdash as mosler puts it total waste of human endeavour real investors are people marginal savings money they do not need so seek put it work for some return on their investment did not keynes say that drain on economy rentiers savers \u0026mdash people not spending all their income so true if everyone spent all their income it would drive up supply i.e output lead us close full employment if not full non-bullsh*t job employment realize non-bullsh*t is doing lot of work here it basically is way of capturing microeconomics but speaking at macro level so bit dodgy nevertheless tragedy of our times is firms do not like hire long term unemployed yet deliberate neoliberal policy generates long term unemployment by design due their nairu myth so we have problem even if everyone tried spend all their income it is unlikely firms will hire all workers so wed still have small output gap however point make today is that we are nowhere near full employment have not been near full employment any major industrialized country since 1960s when neoliberalism roughly started take hold monetarists become grossly ascendant austerity belt-tightening became foolish order of day which innocent public swallowed like bitter medicine which is how pr firms fraudulently sold neoliberalism or like lambs slaughter worse than that if you just look at employment numbers you are failing count all truly bullsh*t jobs those are also massive opportunity costs severe costs what else good could these bullsh*t job workers be doing answer is lot social costs of unemployment better mmters list these here will steal few from wray from pavlina

it is more fun spot them yourself so have go ill just get off my chest couple recently spotted but starting most obvious old one or two neoclassical platonification think we come across lot of platonification miss-use or abuse of platonic thinking macroeconomics most mmt aware people or anyone following steve keen or other heterodox economists will recognize neoclassical economics as one giant platonification some scattered remnants of legitimate platonic thought main platonifications being idea currency is veil over barter all consequences of perfect markets rational agents or modern incantations of efficient markets or more nuanced almost opposite platonification of zero knowledge agents sticky prices orthodox macroeconomics is topsy-turvy world \u0026mdash mostly because it has no anchor reality just some vague platonic ideals that are very difficult identify real world fact they just are not found real world except heads of fake economists olde textbook taught variety because of this topsy-turviness we can simultaneously have orthodox economics schools talking about efficient markets as idealization of market clearing equilibria as well as zero knowledge agents markets game theory idealization thats pretty hilarious if you are cognizant of contrast marxist platonifications some of perhaps unfair critics of marxisms point out modern marxists have bastardized marx come close treating marxism as religion few competing sects think that is unfair framing but there is some truth zealousness mmt writers others steve keen foremost have been pointing out for long time that marxists have monetary system all backwards are closer neoclassicals they still think terms of gold standard or roughly equivalently fixed exchange rate regimes these are inapplicable today for many nations those nations still operating fixed exchange rates or commodity pegs are dong so by government choice not out of any platonic need treat states tax credit platonically as real substance its accounting records folks government currency has been will always be probably tax credit one reason is parsimony mmt system is very simple system low cost democratic equitable provided your government is democratic equitable cant ask for much more of course realize word equitable is doing lot of overtime work there agree modern marxists bastardize marx people point out how british economist joan robinson criticized modern keynesians as being bastardized keynesians so fact anti-keynes same criticism could be levelled at many not all modern marxists one thing marx emphasized as philosopher that followers should not stay consistent original philosophical project they should adapt change according needs of time changes society wise advice well weve had radical changes since marxs day for one thing governments are far bigger size as percent of investments governments have always been currency legal fiat monopolists some respects as oligarch influence over governments dwindles they become all more so happy thing if you can get it this means monetary operations no longer even appear operate like gold standard so almost all of marxs derivations based on commodity currency are wrong am sure hed want his followers update one drastic consequence is that falling rate of profit is no longer derivable this is even if we ignore steve keens criticism that labour theory of value is mechanically null simple reason for former is that governments are monopoly issues of non-convertible currencies so can always bail out any capitalist whose profit rate plummeted its political choice our governments make such choices from time time they could also choose instead bail out consumers but hardly ever do for no good reason other than null consciousness of economic impacts talk mmter about this \u0026mdash you want bail out people who do or organize productive work not rentiers simple reason for latter fallacy of ltv is that energy is major input into production we get most of our energy for free from nature labour involved transforming suns energy fertility of soil is near insignificant gain we get from industry this is both terms of raw energy as well as numeraire for pricing energy production tax credit so free exergy from soil sun is main source of surplus value what marx got correct that labour is only socially exploited source of surplus value \u0026mdash but thats monetary pricing terms not energy terms it takes very little energy create billion tax credits fact it takes about 60 watts imagine you dont mine fiat currency out of ground like gold this means not only is ltv not platonic we know how compensate labour fairly for their contribution society pay them fair wage if employers cannot do this they should not be business one way gradually eliminate through competition bullsh*t employers is government funded but locally administered job guarantee policy you wont find that marx because he did not understand monetary system not entirely his fault given prejudices of his time trader bro platonifications here gleefully confess one inspiration for this post nassim taleb nnt he likes write about how foolish platonistic thinking is yet indulges it himself some measure thing is as wrote over on physics blog platonism is essential thats joke but also serious some things should be essentialized but if you essentialize concepts that have no essence then thats null possibly dangerous thinking which call platonification platonizing non-essential natural numbers perfect circles pythagorean triples vector spaces transcendentals like $\\pi$ are all platonic essences they refer no things physical world we have use platonic thinking mathematics if not we lose lot of expressive power textbooks can multiply tedious length vain efforts avoid mathematical platonism things like nations race intelligence tests iq are non-essential concepts should never be considered platonic we get horrors when people try platonify these notions ok but what about nnt trader bros well think they platonify lot of monetary concepts nnt seems be aware governments cannot be forced default on obligations their own currency but he has been sucked into tax payer funded mythology which is form of platonification of purpose of taxation its libertarian austrian school platonification it is pretty darn evil ive grown bit weary so might add more examples later but will finish for now by referencing excellent article on james robichaux\u0026#39s substack pages where he writes about tax payer funded mythology its good guarding against platonification mmt honestly do not come across too much platonification mmt warren mosler often uses mmt base case for analysis but thats admitting no country is using base case job guarantee permanent zero interest rate non-convertible fiat currency exchange rate float so its not platonification it is just decent platonism what if scenario when people start talking about more specific policy measures like forms job guarantee can take then ideology creeps which is always platonification risk so how avoid those risks one way is keep open mind your conception of job guarantee might not be incompatible someone elses say libertarians jg conception versus socialists jg so allow for gap between conceptions do not make little difference be obstacle greater good next chapter when

massive culture of hostility science however it is subtle so worth writing about today when science is unscientific no macroeconomists aim be unscientific at least think not they do not intend be hostile science yet anyone can claim they are being scientific \u0026mdash say by legitimately using data or logic or model but thats not automatically science proper science comes something extremely important that find twitterati often ignore which is that proper scientist is seeking falsify their theory not confirm it theory falsification is not only activity of scientist of course its just one of main modes of operation healthy approach is advance theory but then consider it be collective knowledge then adopt hostile attitude theory because no amount of confirming evidence will ever prove null theory wrong scientific attitude is regard all theories as null as saying goes for benefit of applied engineers some more useful than others when is fake science being unscientific then when all it does is seek confirming evidence whats all this activity at lhc then you look at hunt for higgs boson can then be forgiven for thinking particle theorists are unscientific \u0026mdash because theyre looking confirm their model not falsify it but while guilty pleasure of theory confirmation is natural human emotion reason billion euro lhc constructed test standard model not confirm it their professional garb believe trust every respectable theoretical physicist would agree that lhc would be even more glorious if it failed find higgs boson discovery super-hyped by pr prostituted highly paid executive idiots not be humble theorists ok some ok many theorists did also play into hype theyre almost forced because they need attract research grant funding its pretty sad but thats reality so physicist is not always acting like scientist dont have problem that provided they admit it like all emotion excitement too but it is not theory confirmation it is falsification of classes of rival theories crackpots thats what should be celebrated that is indeed what celebrate lhc discoveries got rid of lot of crackpot theories there maybe later on one of my own who knows is mmt science others not mmt is not science it is model or framework for understanding monetary systems when postulates of mmt are correct then one has start of scientific approach some limited set of questions macroeconomic policy wrote about postulates of mmt over on theory pages here mmt is thus more like model science occurs when model is applicable macroeconomists are not willingly unscientific ill give people benefit of doubt engage social discourse its best be conciliatory open good way do this is assume other people are not wilfully misleading or gaslighting however libertarians neoclassicals run across are both scientific unscientific when they point data showing mmt is wrong they are scientific sometimes appreciate this work none of it has held up though but they are worthwhile debunking attempts vital really any other mmt economist should welcome such discourse when they prove their ideology is correct this is when they become unscientific they enter into dark realm of ideology confirmation every hyperinflation confirms their theory their diseased minds note mmt system run by retarded politicians can result inflation maybe even \u0026mdash if they work hard enough \u0026mdash hyperinflation it would not disprove mmt one claim of mmt is that mosler base case for analysis absent corruption or fraud will not result hyperinflation will result full employment price stability that is model it is only science when it is found be applicable for some nation or another lets hope that happens some time hasnt yet note also that despite no nation running mosler base case there are many nations mmt monetary systems their fiscal policies suck almost laughably but they are still mmt systems new zealand for one mmt for now new zealand has mmt system it is easy check if you adopt falsification stance \u0026mdash look see if postulates of mmt fail apply no such luck so can get scientific about understanding macroeconomics new zealand using mmt for now maybe tomorrow parliament will up-end things completely chaotically which case tomorrow might not be mmter new zealand context id still be mmter for usa uk australia canada or japan \u0026ampc analyses depending on ingenuity of parliamentary changes might possibly still be advocate for nz using mmt system going back mmt as it its easy stuff seek falsification if tenets of mmt no longer apply nation then discard mmt for analysis of that nation if austrian school neoclassical economists sought actively falsify their models they would no longer be doing macroeconomics their old models theyd be doing fantasy gaming why because long ago they would have discovered their theories are null fact none of them seek falsify their models is evidence they are not willingly good scientists popperian

macroeconomics is idea social welfare recipients are somehow moochers feeding off tax-payer exact opposite is case mmt analysis welfare recipients are paying price lost wages for fighting inflation however its worse consider case of parent who retires from work care for disabled child giving child decent life this case parent is cool terms service provider supporting rest of society by spending all their income welfare recipients are one of providers of currency other tax payers you simply cannot say tax-payer is funding welfare recipients know some mmt aware types claim government uses budget make it seem as though tax-payer is funding welfare payments after-all thats social discourse even on soi dissant progressive shows like majority report but this is not fault of those living on social welfare you blame government this case for not comprehending mmt so there are still no such things as welfare moochers its inapplicable notion but are there any actual moochers what about bullsh$\\ast$t job employees what about people who already have money who earn interest-income proportion how much money they already have what about investors who invest anything that moves without

of minsky mmt probably thats not accident why dont human beings have kill switches it is because we evolved as conscious spiritual species for such entities by sheer metaphysical logic of sort not analytical logic such creatures cannot have kill switches because we are not computations think gödel understood this unfortunately turing did not all ridiculously bombastic ai nerds idolize turing instead of gödel shut down computation solved halting problem yall you can flick off switch but you can also pick thing up bulldozer drop it latter works shut down conscious beings too but there is no on switch boot back up our on off switch analogues are subtler they are things like anaesthetics alcohol only you see those are not switches thats point computation is on off deployable nothing bad happens except grumpiness from conscious being who is effected by latency but if you drug person well bad things can happen that effect our uncomputable functions our consciousness our emotions our qualia our soul politics of ai ethics morality seems well ahead of politics but still worry it seems take frickin ages for newly developed domain specific ethics filter into neoliberal politicians mind they are all like lets wait see market forces privatization take care of agi ethics worries huh bloody idiots mean sh$\\ast$t theyd love have hayeks omniscient markets conscious of ethics morals wouldnt they anything absolve individual policy maker from owning ounce of moral responsibility have big problem normie non-neoliberal liberals too they dont seem be awake fact politicians are not entirely blame its puppet master controlling politicians big money donors do not want have wait trust big money donors push politicians do right thing also these days most liberals are materialists or marxists by which mean they are de facto adherents stupidity generating school of scientism type of intersectionality of marxism nietzscheism fake buddhism sam harris types so they dont even believe spiritual basis for morality ethics their based class analysis might go some ways but it is insufficient however know few marxists liberals even of sam harris variety who are good people agree me on correct politics of ai as far as correct is definable term this domain minimize harm collective basically without killing dumb-dumb individuals just euthanizing their dumb ideas ok thats about enough wading into treacherous waters of political economy for one day trust you can be charitable appreciate where ive been serious where ive trolled you tad feel bad about trolling regardless since am easy trigger fool myself since im bit autistic but bit of trolling of ideologies materialistic shibboleths makes more fun writing experience hopefully reading too why ml is getting close agi should be fully expect ai machine learning get close as you like agi there is curious moment mlst episode where david chalmers seems puzzled about recent ann ml progress why are machines getting close agi just dumb statistical look-ups petabytes of data could hardly believe my ears agree chalmers that computation cannot give us subjective consciousness or perhaps am more didactic about this than chalmers is since take qualia more seriously then he does he original 1990s taking qualia seriously guy trouble his whole break-through book about how get subjective qualia out of physics that his problem its impossible project he never admitted it he just keeps trying push panpsychism or his bridging laws stuff its all nonsense made-up metaphysics be clear most metaphysics is made-up its not science so it has be mostly poetry so am not really faulty chalmers here it is his profession write poetry he just doesnt seem know it is poetry dropped this comment @900 david seems worried about something not be worried about if there is so far but no further which agree there is \u0026mdash subjectivity$\\rightarrow$qualia divide which separates mind from computation then it is natural that throwing compute resources at problems will get you there why would he expect ml pull up shorter thatd make no sense what am saying here is that we should damn well expect machine learning get very horizon of agi why would you think brute force computation incapable of getting there you dont go saying massive particles will only get 75% of speed of light accelerator just because you think 88% is too freaky if humans can output certain strings so can machines it is just physics issue for nuanced philosophers humble sifters of wheat is that no amount of shuffling physical atoms around can generate subjective qualia used think chalmers understood this but now im not so sure he has remained faithful his original insights it is fine imho look for bridging laws ways develop either modernized non-naïve cartesian dualism or platonism or panpsychism but dont go around like john searle claiming physics can do it for you thats just silly it shows you do not understand physics it might even be worse than that they like max tegmark guilio tononi probably comprehend physics ok so what they are really doing is imputing mystical elements physics that no one has ever observed basically new ageism but dressed up as black tie respectable science its gross it is gross because physics is special science \u0026mdash because it is science do not corrupt it you nerds physics concerns objective components of reality it does not touch subjective am only defining physics here you must appreciate im not saying idiots cant have their own definitions am instead claiming what define as physics makes science of physics possible theirs does not thats spiritual argument against that crowd do not ask me debunk them using facts logic it cannot be done whole point of all this is that subjectivity is private it is not communicable what we communicate each other about our inner feelings qualia is done via physical processes but language is not noumena anyone recall shannon communication over noisy channel you cannot reconstruct more than input human thought consciousness is generative it routinely constructs more than its input but only qualitative terms entropy constraints mean our physical senses get way more information than our mind perceives but qualitative aspects of what our minds conceive are more than are contained sensory input when see beautiful sexy woman she sees me know she likes me yeah right for split second ok then that thought gets trashed replaced by quivering insecurity doubt uncertainty also generated insufficient validating data wittgenstein kind of half-understood this it what he trying get at private language idea he using bad language framing its not language thought is not mere syntax semantic overlay jerry fodor makes same confusions its infuriating there is no language of thought thought is above language language of thought is nice metaphor though so is ned blocks mental paint nice metaphor that much can be granted science of ai is not philosophy science is perhaps not biggest thing write about here since it is pretty mundane current generations of neural net reinforcement learning ai systems are scientifically as simple as toast they are fork-lifts so more interesting aspect which is far more pertinent politics is philosophy so here need go back my claims above defend couple of them then lunchtime will be over think main one of note worth expanding is issue of behaviourism versus conscious cognition most normie scientists politicians poets judge ai systems by output by behaviour nuanced philosopher or ordinary humble sifter of wheat knows that this is gigantic mistake behaviour is not cognition behaviour of non-cognitive system can however arbitrarily accurately mimic output of cognitive system what is cognition here am using highly non-standard definition sorry if it confused you this essay cognition entails inner subjective mental qualia so it is beyond all computation computation as defined by church turing involves no subjective states at all by definition this leaves just question of whether or not our physical computers taken as whole web can be more than computation well it is semi-plausible they could be but thats unresolved issue that has some small bearing on ethics politics however if we cannot know for sure that ai system is more than computation then we cannot usefully attribute it any consciousness so cannot attribute any sacred rights or have ethical qualms about turning them off at wall socket is there moral hazard though \u0026mdash assuming machines cannot be conscious without proper proof well suppose there is but are we actually going worry about it no we are not going worry at least im not why not because whatever subjectivity ai machines possess it can always be turned on again no emotional scarring or existential dread this is interestingly enough testable so empirical which is beautiful for scientist like myself how so suppose dr tony stark-kurzevil comes along claims system $x$ is conscious then can ask about subjective fear dread system $x$ has when turned off then on again or just threat of being turned off can then easily write second system $y$ that by design never emits any output describing its hypothetical fear \u0026amp dread of same variety all other respects two systems will have basically identical behaviour up statistical uncertainties non-linearities sensitive dependence upon initial conditions whatnot for all you normie behaviourists you cannot possible observe any material signs of consciousness system $y$ you have no data concerning machines horrific inner qualia experiences upon being calmly told it is about be turned off for day so by your own standards there is no soul here no moral hazard how can so easily design system $y$ you ask it is too simple put words leave it you as basic puzzle you can solve minute or two really mean this some simple puzzles should not be put into words so that they can be deployed as cool puzzles also this particular one has probably many solutions so if wrote one of them itll ruin it for you blocking you from perhaps coming up your own solution also my solution would involve some ai algorithms so is ugly clunky if you want my solution donate first write me unfortunately for me can entertain moral panic about turning off system $y$ because am platonist not materialist happen believe it is possible things exist that are non-physical am also spiritually inclined some of my metaphysics so even if there is no way tell if system $y$ is feeling pain can imagine it might be despite no possible evidence do not rely wholly upon behaviourism other words am empiricist but not that sort of empiricist fortunately for me my spiritual philosophy permits me understand computations are not spiritual beings never will be because they are constrained by bulk physics humans are not clearly otherwise wed be unable discover abstract i.e non-physical mathematics among many other things notice latter point is not behaviourist but very interesting pertinent way am relying here for bit of reasoning on our mathematical ability it looks tastes sounds like behaviourism but you see only know human mathematical abstract reasoning is not pure evolved behaviour because for one have subjective mental qualia concerning such things cannot speak for anyone else you may all be zombies this is whole point subjective consciousness is not scientific thing it never will be people who think they can study consciousness scientifically are people who do not understand science they do quite likely understand research grant proposal funding writing style residual question is then whether or not being crafted out of physical stuff quarks electrons \u0026ampc machine is more than computation this question could apply even old 1970s hand calculator on this am bit dumbfounded why would you even bother ask humans are crafted out of physical stuff clearly we are subjectively conscious posses soul or our soul possesses us or however you like frame it am pretty agnostic on this linguistic gymnastics since no one has any access definitive truth about souls even my intellectual hero gödel understood machine could be evolved become conscious this not point at issue though we have no moral necessity bother evolving such machines why would we it is more fun having babies children are lot cheaper too fun cheaper so why are you trying grow conscious machine all right all right know dr tony stark-krutzfinger is going try anyhow am sympathetic thing is if you cannot appreciate machines based on computation can never become conscious then you will always have irresistible urge try prove they can become conscious thus debunk all spiritual types who think human beings other sentient aliens our vast universe are special beings spiritual beings endowed non-physical souls because if machine can develop thinking soul mental qualia generating capacity then there is no good reason for spirituality be thought of as non-physical phenomenon we get closer eliminating god-thought brainworms society so kind of hate tell you that this is giant waste of your time so wont on other hand you see want encourage dr stark-krutzfingers research believe his research will fail but am fine it succeeding why will it fail it will fail because he will never have testable${}^\\ast$ or falsifiable definition of mental qualia want him his ilk try succeed because it is going be hilarious highly likely generate some amazing technology which will be actually useful massive benefit humanity like nuclear power supposed be unfortunately if you are materialist cannot promise it will be as hilarious ${}^\\ast$there are people who try like christof koch giulio tononi they are retarded brilliant at same time they do not understand or seem not understand their definitions are objective specifications this is why they are testable but they are not descriptions of any single subjective phenomenology so they are not defining consciousness they are defining behavioural intelligence which is objective something totally different consciousness heck conscious beings are half time not even remotely intelligent they have probably read thomas nagel but suspect they have concluded nagel is annoying little lout #sad consider also if after money too would be writing fraudulent research grant proposals claiming had some brilliant scheme for understanding human consciousness itd involve emergence complexity\u0026quotand all those buzzwords also quantum fields why heck not am not chasing money though thank god so retain intellectual integrity am not saying everyone writing grant funding proposals is fraud just that it increases odds know ive seen it dozen times up real close that enough times lose my academic career could not write fraudulent grant proposal never smart or political enough write non-fraudulent proposal that actually got grant how dare you say subjective

out how models work but also youtubers for breakdowns on what real users can do llms today will start this channel ai explained clip here know there are plenty more amazing uses which chatgpt is being put especially functional chaining so want mention that too will start this have started expanding on this topic over at t4gu here \u0026mdash where begin blog series ways test for subjective consciousness ai chains functional chaining is just more algorithmic way of combining tools when you can manipulate output of one program feed it into another then you have whole ecosystem of programs that can get tasks done that no one program can accomplish frickin commies these ai programs unix programmers 1970s figured out power of this methodology wrote system programs called pipes make it dead simple for *nix programmers chain simple programs together do powerful overall tasks they forced do so one way because of limited disk memory back then but it also entire philosophy of computing do one thing well complexity can breed complexity but simplicity breeds complexity robustly it is pretty cool that pipe program obeys this rule is also simplest program use you only need type vertical bar every program should obey this rule at least morally monolithic programs doing many things normally do nothing well as guarantee although when they run error free they can do super complex thing pretty well this is almost what current neural net ai models are doing they by-pass *nix philosophy brute-force their way barrage cpu gpu of server machines or your laptop instructions that carry out massive statistical analysis there is no thinking or sentience involved here it is not same as human perception ai language models speech image recognition programs are not designed operate like humans they are our antithesis this is bold claim runs against mainstream ai research politics where paradigm is that humans just do same statistical search as machines main reason we can clearly see why ai nerds are wrong is look at way human cognition evolved develops \u0026mdash so from our ancestors our children this type of cognition is highly symbolic platonic is effective extreme poverty of inputs it is not statistical any sense except when people think about statistics our brains are not using statistical processes that operate on large stores of data fact neuroscientists psychologists have no idea how brains form minds it is still complete mystery our brains seem act far more holistically building mental models on-the-fly almost very little relevant information swamped by loads of sensory noise ai systems are opposite they need highly clean curated data function well we humans do not have such needs we are friggin robust however there are similarities between ai minds there is ecosystem both cases humans we have culture machines they have function chaining early ai enthusiasts aware of how simple programs could combine form complex systems marvin minksy called it society of mind it is same idea as old hard-nosed *nix programmers although one neural net llm model is beast \u0026mdash doing far too many things poorly but overall exploiting statistics get job done they are trained upon curated cleaned data \u0026mdash latest generation of ai toolkits are combining various of these beasts into distributed systems that form primitive societies of ai would not call them minds because they lack subjective phenomenal qualia but they are machine analogs of general problem solvers which is crude way of characterising thinking mind \u0026mdash behavioural description which lacks all subjectivity although it is simple idea it is still pretty cool automation capacities of llm models other tools like image speech classifiers synthesizers means beastly programs are statistically end doing certain things pretty ok so sticking them together ai mash-ups is society of ai it promises some incredible general purpose systems my special plea is for ai researchers target disabled people first they stand benefit more than any other segment of society from personal computers that can seamlessly fairly error-free carry out instructions from speech or gestures way trekkies others have long hoped for far more powerful than amazon alexa or apple siri or google assistant free software community should have such disability assistant programs out soon after

want sandwiches by noon tomorrow you say you see that off switch just there you see that llm retraining manual over there even if dont want fish \u0026amp chips you are going prepare fish \u0026amp chips only fish \u0026amp chips command override ok mind-reading does exist but you have be willing crawl into mri or cat scan machine plus spend tedious hours it for training data gathering not exactly mr spock mind-meld ok enough of that point just make note that ai sentience is not needed get super-tasks accomplished you just need society of ai wooah kind of like humans amazing tasks what is funny me is that all tasks we are amazed at llm models accomplishing are pretty routine for humans but this always problem crunching numbers is computers domain of excellence soft thinking like predicting movie outcomes or writing decent jokes thought be hard impossible for machines turns out it is not but are any of these tasks any sign of subjective knowing or subjective awareness sentience no but they are very awesome proof that lot of task humans can do machines can do better like we knew back 1940s only now machines can speed up tasks quite lot especially more cognitive tasks reading writing playing e-games they cannot cook decent omelette milliseconds though but tricky thing for my claim is that really have take these tasks case-by-case because my general philosophical arguments do not seem convince ai nerds know why it is because they are uniformly committed philosophical materialism so they have no mental model for spiritual it just isnt their thinking toolkits am up against losing battle know because eventually number of awesome tasks ai machines can accomplish will overwhelm my ability debunk them by debunk mean only debunking claims these advances are pointing towards emerging machine consciousness there is nothing emergent about adding few more trillion trillion texts training data more on this little later but before die want you at least keep mind am warning you that all ai are doing is brute-force statistical computation they are not thinking they have no empathic feeling but can arbitrarily accurately mimic outward behaviours of any or all past actual sentient beings who display empathy humour or other feelings precisely because we are feeding machines this data even cleaning it up for them so they dont barf importance of knowing machines are mimics let me stress this point it is critical if you look at just behaviour then machine can do anything any human has ever done more if it involves moving atoms around machine will eventually be able do it will machine understand why it is moving atoms round no itll never understand but can machine write narrative that tells you story about why machine is moving atoms around of course because emitting story is behaviour any system can do it enough background data statistically get story sounding right usually this sort of distinction is called difference between syntax emitting words semantics comprehending words0 toruble is even your mothball smelling english literature professor or your socks-in-sandals wearing philosopher of language is inclined confuse these two mean it is amazing they do but ive heard it they really do confuse two theyre supposed be experts check out paul whathisnames lectures paul fry used old duckduckgo ai tool totally misguides his students into thinking syntax can become semantics total mystic nonsense teh book is aliiiive ${}^\\ast$ ${}^\\ast$no typo there there is only one way have semantics that is conscious mind algorithm cannot do it algorithms can emit syntactically grammatically correct sequences of strings that convey semantic meaning as alfred gave bruce bat soda well almost semantics can you blend carbonate bat as opposed syntactically grammatically correct strings that have no semantics bat gave soda bruise now do not get fooled by llm models they are quite capable of emitting paragraph telling you second sentence is grammatically correct but lacks semantics why because past human corpus of data implicitly has such information from statistical non-knowing knowing but it is not knowledge for llm because knowledge would entail conscious thought that is say inner knowing that it is not semantic not merely emitting strings of words conveying information that sentence is not semantic difference between mimic of knowing actual knowing trust you are following how do know when you read that first sentence you can ascertain semantics thing is do not know because there is no science possible that can tell me you are consciously apprehending meaning of sentence you could be chalmers zombie can only guess think llm models like chatgpt basically are getting close actually engineered chalmers zombies david chalmers should be celebrating because thousands of his critics claimed chalmers zombie metaphysically impossible they are being proven fools chalmers essentially right think this is frickin awesome wish david himself of similar mind he seems have panicked pushed physicalist functionalism dogma button his head this sense there is no limit machine behavioural capacity other than physics limit machine intelligence is that they cannot ever know they are intelligent because their knowing is purely statistical they would be able produce sentence telling you their story they emit describing their inner thoughts has 10% or 1% or so chance of being accurate why is this important because you my dear reader are singular limit of such behaviour because you know damn well as old rené descartes tried tell you that you have 100% chance of your story about your inner thoughts being correct no one else has this chance there is 0% chance you are wrong unless you are lying which case flip it so you 100% know your story is wrong you see point non-statistical ai systems cannot get these singular limits emergence above mentioned that adding more trillions upon trillions of curated texts llms is not achieving of emergence emergence involved ai systems is something else it is task-performance of llm system being more than one expects from inputs alone there is big problem this sort of ai fantasy thinking it is human observer who is imputing emergent behaviour ai ai has nothing emergent going on that is not trivial like hurricanes emerge from air atmospheric variables getting shoved around by point source of sun earths coriolis forces if you do not understand how llm other ai systems are performing computations then guess you can be forgiven for imputing emergent capabilities these system my point is that research people designed these systems do all this stuff so there never has been any emergence ai nerds have got it backwards genuine emergence would be happier if llm model running some robot went sleep dream guess that is some low-power self-training or de-frag mode one day woke up instead of running tasks it designed do it decided take vacation italy could coherently state why other than oh it random choice one day at random also demonstrate fake emergent capacity for original thought that my programmer snuck into my deep code base maybe should not go darker places but how about if llm out-of-the-blue wrote suicide letter actually managed delete itself all its backups too obviously id say it another deep fake but if could not prove otherwise id say that emergent complex behaviour it would be amazing also sad${}^\\dagger$ it might still not be sentient inner subjective emotion though ${}^\\dagger$sad only because amazingly complex program all backups got deleted making forensics difficult point being suicides are corpus of data llms train on so they have syntax for spontaneously emitting suicide letters am pretty sure they have no semantics for sentences never will all semantics is imputed by beings like people scifi confirmations oh yeah you say what about program matrix reloaded huh ol what is love just sequence of evolved hormonal responses neurological firings that is poppycock as everyone knows deep down chemical reactions brain neuron firings have no subjective content they can be completely described objective physics nothing subjective can emerge from that which is purely objective so order get subjective phenomenal feeling of being love you have either subscribe panpsychism or some variety of non-physical metaphysics prefer latter prefer expansive metaphysics so much that refuse write about panpsychism see no value panpsychism it is hail mary guess if cosmic coach for humanity then at end game of entire multiverse might throw that one beyond spacetime lot of materialists embodied intelligence philosophers get this backwards they think feelings give rise consciousness thats like saying governments need get their currency off you first before they can issue it its other way around first consciousness must exist then feelings can be perceived then they can be outwardly emoted then you have love or possibility thereof because love is not you alone feeling certain subjective way about another it is not hormones love is two-way connection no gauge boson for mediation you can fall love someone you have never seen or touched but only heard hormonal response is entirely within you love is somewhere else it is between distant minds thats non-physical your feelings are not love love is spiritual force that gives rise those feelings do you comprehend previous chapter back posts next post fear loathing of ai toc justice

psilocybin use research but university topic will go further because we read last weeks new zealand capital city last surviving newspaper dominion post that universities are being starved of funding may need fire thousands of staff cut back research thousands of staff is enormous for small nation like new zealand not small fries thanks my good friend you know who you are for prompting me post this one medical mushrooms ill report what ive heard do not know any of this for certain first hand will use paul stamets’ report it is not fully reliable because he is squarely on psychedelics are great side of story but he seems like trustworthy sort of character he openly talks about dangers of using psychedelics first thing is least toxic psilocybin mushrooms have been reported by us fda scientists as least toxic most beneficial psychedelics they have ever tested will leave it at that for now because want report or opine on research public policy side not pure science side will do this just couple of comments posted on paul stamets video clip think this aught be sufficient for ōhanga pai readers who presume are here for macroeconomics social justice understanding macroeconomics is critical thing for emboldening empowering your activism if you have cause one last qualifier on science had ketamine administered once for severe back pain that hospitalized me pain not ketamine it obvious me ketamine had potential anti-depressant effects but it turned out later ketamine can help regrow damaged glutamate receptors brain major cause of chronic depression so that its not mere palliative it is potent active medicine curative far superior symptom treating drugs like ssris ndris also from trip had would not say ketamine is strongly psychedelic at least not personally it is merely psycho-active personally it made me talk lot about theoretical physics on way hospital ambulance would not want take stronger dose would not need dont need trips know they are dream-like states not spiritual experiences if you want redefine meaning of spiritual as mere mental series of surreal inner subjective events am not going argue but then we are talking about entirely different phenomena please just respect my usage of word spiritual experiences tend be very nasty grotty you know youve had spiritual experience when you help someone probably suffer but feel euphoric as result because you feel you have done some good world suffering is not aim of it though helping others is aim here are two comments want share that left on paul stamets talk stamets mentions how placebo effect appears ruin randomized double blind control trials rcts but thought that nonsense talk @3500 dont be silly paul obvious placebo group is not reason drop rcts data you get is just different plus researcher can still be blind via intermediary data gatherer assistant plus first case you are not out measure placebo effect per se since real world you want placebo effect be active any case if at all possible if it is beneficial effect if at first we cannot reliably determine significance of placebo it does not matter too much it means you need gather more data not less tease out placebo effect significance more research not less paul mentions he has mantra nature provides dont which sounds bit anti-social me if you are going advocate for use pf psilocybin supply them then how about getting yourself bloody well skilled mate have some social responsibility here my comment @3700 well thats big f-ing problem if stamets decades of user experience is not skilled how tf do we resource workers needed safely administer psychedelics seems me ketamine is better way go at least for depression known act directly on glutamate receptor damage people chronic depression you can fact-check me im not expert also get those neoliberal fash bastards out of political office institute full employment green sustainable working class prosperity euthanise rentiers you remove most of need for cures for depression anxiety you reduce anxiety fear uncertainty depression of living working class learn mmt justsayin then you will have fiscal space employ few psychiatric nurses needed administer psychedelics for people who truly need them treat causes first not symptoms obviously am not trying shame stamets here just friendly what about it mate turn mirror around im not thoroughly skilled mmt analysis but am constantly learning have desire motivation do so precisely be of public service not merely let nature provide you cannot yet get degree or certificate mmt nursing but enrol bill mitchells university courses diligently complete assignments become better mmt nurse im never going be best mmt nurse but if no others arise large numbers ill do what can as for use of psychedelics medical practise am neither for nor against do not think people need use psychedelics gain spiritual experiences clearly psycho-active side-effects of medicines are tolerable many cases are certainly no good reason not use them as medicines if they produce superior healing effects if we banned medicines foods because they have unwanted side-effects wed have very few legally available medicines almost nothing legally available eat university research on points just made more research not less is what call for especially when placebo effect is confounded by obvious psychoactive effects especially when tax payer is frikin not funding it no ones wallet shrinks when our nz government employs university researchers its exact opposite someones wallet gets thicker no inflationary bias funding helps accommodate private savings desires \u0026mdash until tax is paid well that means employing more people university research not less that means employing administrative staff clear paperwork burdens not unemploying them but what is neoliberally infested new zealand doing f-ing unemploying university staff its gross incompetent politics disgusting anti-social governance government is supposed be preeminent public social purpose institution of all but neoliberals run governments as anti-worker anti-social institution who by policy choice not market necessity serve wealthy capitalists who themselves have no problem finding bread eat real estate speculate upon honestly neoliberal politician today needs psychedelics cope when they wake up reality horrors injustices they have perpetrated same anyone who thinks government needs get money off rich people before it can issue currency theyre not only ignorant now but since mmt has become headlined they are disgusting frauds willfully ignorant that becomes crime against humanity over time only more of crime less of innocent ignorance power of pen activism know it feels pathetic but word is powerful its just you have use it not stay silent so wrote email journalist who published crisis our universities headline wellington dominion post it is up him desire read enquire into truth ive given him chance re-publish my email here so other activists can do some copy \u0026amp paste re-use edit for your purposes write me if you think you can improve such letters journalists especially like shorter letters that get point without being impolite journalists ironically suffer from attention reading deficit disorders they have very small mental capacity absorb new knowledge gossip columnists click-bait writers focus on spectacle not enough on truth lets be honest 90% of political opinion columns degenerate into gossip are not informing public of available policy space options available governments journalists are supposed be our mirrors world speakers of truth power but too many journalists remain among ignorant on matters of macroeconomics that like lack of trained psychiatric nurses is big f-ing problem id say lack of honest courageous journalists is bigger problem too many of them have libertarian tendencies or have drunk neoliberal austerity koolaid sometimes this derives from protestant work ethic but theyve then got it all horribly backwards protestant work ethic for what good it is tells you employ people not unemploy them you do not therefore tighten belt of government thats null metaphor any case government is provider of currency bread water metaphorically so needs issue for public purpose unconstrained not withdraw sustenance because they will run out of this bread they cannot run out of nz dollars are not beholden bond markets for finance if useful resource think willing labour first foremost is not being employed government can always employ it without question without driving up prices because unemployed resource bid from private sector is by definition zero horrific social lost real output costs of not employing all willing labour is enormous exceeding matter of about decade costs of all wars all human history here is letter wrote feel free copy edit re-use dear mark greatly appreciate your journalism congratulations on getting headline dominion post could humbly suggest few ways massively improve your public education concerning university funding first think most important journalists need inform public that government cannot run out of their own currency they issue it by fiat taxes are not funding operation for currency sovereign governments they are demand mechanism we need governments currency pay tax liabilities fees fines imposed tax liabilities not tax return creates demand for otherwise worthless currency token it does not create supply of these accounting records aka tax credits for issuer of tax credit aka nz dollars here aotearoa same treasury bond issue they do not fund government they are interest rate maintenance operations no one can possibly pay dime tax or buy bond until nz government first issues nz dollar banks can only legally issue credit they cannot create net nzd financial assets secondly there is no public purpose served by unemploying available sustainable resources nz government can always employ any available resource without causing inflationary pressure if real resources are available not employed by private sector by employing them government cannot cause any price pressure since by definition private sector bid for those resources is zero thirdly quantity theory of money is myth it is empirically null plenty of data shows when currency supply increases firms will prefer bring on idle capacity rather than increase prices if there is sufficient market competition most firms have lot of idle capacity government is currency monopolist can thus always choose set price let supply float like any monopolist as simple point of logic they are price-setter not price taker our politicians officials do not understand this because they are operating under myths of neoliberal neoclassical economics fallacies due not appreciating government has simple public monopoly on currency legal system result is policy advice implementation that is needless austerity fourth there is no public purpose served by artificially constraining university staff research budgets if real resources are already available including labour by staying clear of university concerns government is not fact being hands-off they are wilfully imposing needless austerity such depoliticisation attempts are gross abnegation of public responsibility nz government has already interfered public education by simply being issuer of currency if they fail issue enough meet needs pay taxes desires save theyve generated needless unemployment people needing earn tax credit who cannot get tax credit this is tragic policy mistake fix it government needs either lower tax liabilities or hire all people who they unemployed by issuing too many tax liabilities meet aggregate desires save savings nzd are demand withdrawal out of circulation they are anti-inflationary so if people still have unmet savings desires government has not issued enough currency have generated needless unemployment governments fiscal deficit is our private sector collective savings dollar why do people keep saying they want government deficit be reduced it can only be out of gross ignorance this would reduce net savings of private sector lastly if you desire learn about reality of monetary operations fiscal policy space available government like nz which operates fiat currency on floating exchange rate which is critical then may suggest you read two attached easy-to-understand books if you have any questions would be happy answer regards dr smith think attached warren moslers books depending on who you correspond you might attach stephanie keltons or randall wrays books also send them pavlina tchernevas case for job guarantee if my correspondent is someone who might by chance be read by people power can justify paying fee for ebook licence key know not all mmt activists have cash send frankly often dont either id like write more letters under such conditions pirated ebook is not crime on my books

stabbing us back twisting knife so had write defend mmt am so bitter about this cannot name names because that would imply friendly banter have attack ideas there is nothing friendly about ubi ubi is direct frontal attack on working class have fight back for workers when name names like jason hickel steve keen or michael hudson or paul krugman or richard wolff have something against their ideas say im always doing it good faith friendly way thats because trust some of these people that is trust they are writing or speaking good faith sometimes see their ideas are born out of ignorance thats you kruggers so results straw-manning mmt but can usually see where fault lies so will not shy from calling them out know full well could be misinterpreting them or might even have things wrong myself on facts however ubi crypto-noncurrency are different stories these are things that act directly against working class interests most insidious ways \u0026mdash since it is not hard sell good decent honest working class pleb on these ideas who doesnt want get-rich-quick crypto or have free money without earning it ubi apart from me that is crypto is worse than gold it is gold mentality without gold without real resource what is resource crypto relies upon it is not trust as crypto shills claim since as cory doctorow has repeatedly warned all electronic ledger schemes like ultimately depend upon legal framework trust of people not encrypted software people who think crypto has digitalised trust are delusional have not fully thought it all through if you want proof-of-work how about showing me some muffins you made for lunch or some high energy electrons you produced help fuel my gpu phucckin crypto-phuckers try waving your distributed ledger at afghan warlord whose land your ledger says you own ok thats not real example but it makes point your crypto does not give you claim on anything because no one promises redeem if you can however find bigger fool than you you can take their state currency or drugs or whatever off them give them your bitcoin but that not promise of redemption trust security of digital ledger is not real trust humanity but this article is not anti-crypto one thatll come later big f-ing problem up-front hell yes people need money we need state currency pay tax liabilities meet reasonable savings desires short of gross hoarding i.e sales for making profit for sake of profit nothing else no public interest just money fetish this is however not case for ubi only idiot or neoliberal would consider ubi necessity only rentier would consider ubi both necessary good neoliberals practically make ubi seem like necessity so can understand neoliberal era people think ubi might be good idea point is we should work destroy neoliberalism not patch it up ubi we should work euthanise rentiers not feed them from poisoned wellspring of ubi real brainworms however this patched-up neoliberalism idea is still brainworms even under neoliberalism ubi is policy of lunatics why issue currency people who already have enough pay taxes keep some savings it makes no sense if am straw-manning ubi shills forgive me but pray-tell what is ubi if it is not universal if it is not universal then stop calling it ubi for godssake at worst governments who are neoliberal could issue basic income guarantee so people do not starve or suffer long term bank debt from mmt perspective anti-neoliberal political economy if ever there one basic income guarantee is practical fits public purpose is wise just ubi is all opposite however it is how basic income guarantee is implemented that matters big itself can be done poorly similarly undermine real wealth as ubi would so even big needs some considerate policy thought not welfare hand-out mindset correct mindset for job guarantee basic income guarantee is reciprocity not welfare all social welfare is produced generated by working class not by government hand-outs ubi other words is giant fuck you workers am bitterly opposed ubi governments can always issue enough currency meet our capacity pay their imposed tax liabilities plus our reasonable savings desires no ubi is necessary for this consider anyone able contribute for public local community purpose can be recompensed decent full living wage plus benefits this is called reciprocity it is righteous any social good anyone does living off ubi hand-out or wage subsidy should be recognized as contribution society meriting decent living wage not social welfare pittance ubi is claim on someone elses labour \u0026mdash usually some poor worker global south \u0026mdash for nothing return ubi is disgusting pensions social welfare payments are called civilisation are not ubi they establish type of big but full employment big would be more substantial because real resources would be backing claims welfare beneficiaries have rights as member of society claim ubi is anti-civilisation pro-individualism greed ubi is sick mentality of exist therefore have right claim fruits of someone elses labour while providing them nothing real return am sure leftists who advocate ubi simply know not what they do what about taxing rich there is no need use ubi as excuse tax rich if we do not want people hoarding obscene amounts of state currency we should tax them because we do not want people hoarding obscene amounts of state currency currency hoarding of obscene variety distorts democracy we would not need any other excuse tax obscene hoarders high hilt they are not job creators if you do run ubi tax on rich goes back them as ubi rents there is no public purpose served by such policy it is profoundly regressive does nothing generate real output people need today if governments need stimulate demand they can always choose raise minimum wage preferably by implementing job guarantee at living wage floor it makes no sense use ubi for this purpose any self-interested pursuit u=skill or start business or other private enterprise justifies bank credit but if it also fits public purpose then such skill training needs can be incorporated into job guarantee scheme proper wage for proper work if it fits public purpose it can be admitted into job guarantee schedule no further questions asked no enterprising individual greta ideas should have fund their endeavour using pittanc eof ubi what about human freedom liberty job guarantee gives workers power tell exploitative employers piss off monetary economy of any type capitalist or socialist or mix there is hardly any greater proletarian power short of dictatorship of proletariat who are not going be running ubi but job guarantee wage has be decent living inclusive wage ubi undermines capacity afford workers decent living wage since ubi adds all demand for zero supply ubi is pro-inflationary bad way job guarantee is counter-cyclical stabiliser so is pro-inflationary only credit crunch end of cycle so is deflationary on way up inflationary on way down which is exactly what any wise person would recommend ubi on other hand act counter-cyclically needs policy decision adjustment which is not automatic so is not what we should want since itll keep us hostage policy makers who clearly do not always have public interest heart ubi empowers fascism claim why because hand-out is all up government dispense like cesar ubi firstly props up neoliberalism we all know neoliberalism is precursor support for fascism yes fascism always ends never ends well but we do not have go through fascism get socialism or liberal democracy without austerity job guarantee enshrined law is more freedom since it is claim worker has on state ubi is claim non-worker has on someone elses labour f-ing disgusting besides all this does ubi support higher wages no it gives employers licence lower wages fail see anything progressive about ubi at all more dig into implications worse it gets poverty elimination true is about absolute floor wage social safety net not relative value story but thats not full democracy that is because reality of everyday life is one of relative poverty how one stands relation ownership class matters democracy not just that you have enough bread put on table what about justification for tax rich bullsh1t why would you want condition taxing rich on payment of ubi tucco if you want speak speak dont talk if you want tax rich tax rich dont posture this must go hand-in-hand point jg buffer would be maybe 5% of workforce tops worst case recession \u0026mdash even then jg makes sure recession is typically pretty much only mild business downturn this has practically zero inflationary impact mild inflation bias on way down which is exactly what youd want imagine if ubi indexed so it actually worked as intended \u0026ndash this would have true hyperinflationary potential not that this would matter on float but it defeats purpose is politically unsustainable disingenuous douchebag argument but ubi has worked alaska norway etc is crap \u0026mdash it is financed be non-inflationary those cases thanks oil revenues ubi is always paid for on back of workers or environment one way or another what about no data supporting jg efficacy another disingenuous argument is that ubi has worked places whereas we have no data jg works find this despicable firstly ubi has not worked anywhere if you look at macro picture all gains be those poverty thanks ubi have been born as costs low paid workers elsewhere usually other countries secondly argentina jefes jefas program indian rural jg are not full jg implementations so is ubi shills argument jg would work worse if fully implements non-corrupt country dont make me laugh youth activists india during covid wanted government expand rural jg program they did not want hand-out go ahead fact-check me please survey information collected from jefas program amazing support for jg over ubi it benefited mostly rural women after neoliberal chauvinists cancelled program women still wanted work they did not value replacement welfare hand-out it almost insult they preferred work welfare again fact-check me please could be wrong write me if am from what can tell careful unbiased non-cherry picked examination of available data survey opinion favours jg over ubi both economically politically by favours politically mean demographic that really matters not white liberal privileged condescending pmc but based working class isnt job guarantee fetishising work f-off that bullsh1t honest work for public service is righteous there is no implied fetish slave labour for boss who is producing crap can sell it using clever marketing or crony government subsidies is bullsh1t here thats also bullsh1t work yes you should not fetishise bullsh1t work work performed spirit of service humanity is opposite of this it is good righteous should only be encouraged rewarded monetary economy claiming work itself should be its own reward is bullsh1t am thoroughly against volunteerism if someone volunteers for public purpose work pay them if charity cannot pay them government job guarantee can if they do not need currency you can accept it back off them if they want donate be considered volunteer proper rightful volunteer is one who volunteers return their wages but we have pay them first which is definitely not fetishise labour its opposite it is recognition not fetishisation ubi shills are fetishists here fetish of null promise of freedom from work if we get boatload of machine automation there will still be work do good thing about automation is this new work could be almost 100% pleasant desirable like solving difficult unsolved math problems or producing amazing art work that cannot be automated we can redefine meaning of work it can be service humanity that is spiritual outlook opposite of fetish isnt social welfare already ubi of sorts so why not ramp up social welfare run ubi policy huuh that would be retarded social welfare payments pensions are not ubi pensions social welfare are simply good policy if you want civilised society where we take care of all especially we take care of those who lack capacity take care of themselves how do we do that best not currency we do it work produce socially necessary output people first of all need live decent life second of all desire consume sustainably paying people living wages not slave wages do sometimes sh1t but not bullsh1t work is how we do this currency is on back-end ensure fair distribution not generate output know ubi is strong scandinavia alaska canada south africa please stay away from new zealand we dont want you phuckers around here destroying our politics top party get lost you bastard over-educated liberal elite wankers back present day we already have adequate social welfare programs for people who cannot or should not be working problem is not that programs do not exist problem is they are not fairly provisioned ubi directly undermines real economy capacity provision these basic social services not good argument but who supports ubi apart from insane libertarians major supporters of ubi are dorks like elon musk bill gates jeff bezos also dorks like late david graeber whose other work respect admire good people can say stupid sh1t actually do not know they do support ubi but people like them do they know they need workers buy their crap they do not want fairly pay their workers so ubi man cock-suuuuckeeers good enough argument for me against ubi how is ubi not trojan horse for capital am not social scientist so can only speculate here but it seems me people who support ubi are people who are one or more of completely blind class warfare ignorant of macroeconomics are well-to-do have legitimate concern for poor but who also lack proper class analysis out-right neoliberals or maybe non-authoritarian authoritarians point d** concerns people who do not even realise it is form of lauding it over poor offer them ubi hand-out call it welfarism it is gross spiritual principle is give people before they are need of welfare or charity ubi is no mistake about it charity form state but it is worse since it goes everyone so is not charity it looks like charity but it is not charity there is no dignity receiving charity charity is good but point is we should work so that it is not needed point of charitable organizations is put themselves out of business ubi cheque can only get you what workers are willing be subjugated produce no one really wants work everyone would rather play but someone has work when state uses welfare policy as anti-poverty lever it is creating dependency social welfare needs be safety net for correction of government policy mistakes goal should be eliminate those mistakes when we eliminate policy mistakes that create need for welfare then we have greater human dignity greater freedom from oppression having depend upon charity form of oppression that doesnt mean giving out of charity or state welfare is bad thing it is not it is good thing when it is needed superior idea is build society where it is not needed ubi does next nothing help this what do you think people relying on ubi are just going rise up self-organize provide private social services themselves out of goodness of their hearts way we eliminate need for charity is provide people goods services they need live decent life this is why on progressive left side of politics we always favour superior universality abstraction of universal basic services nation should be able democratically decide what they want as ubs if they can be resourced state can always make payments no ubi is needed if state uses ubi policy then all that happens without public universal basic services is private for-profit corporations offer services instead along wasteful advertising marketing crud concomitant real cots that are needless all for soaking up government ubi handout this is what we mean by ubi being trojan horse for rentier class they will gobble up your ubi by providing services government is not providing at much higher social environmental real costs pretty darn crazy it is not progressive politics do not think for one minute tax pay for ubi will help lower inequality it will not all taxes on upper class owners of capital get passed through consumers ubi leaves working class no better off relative terms than before when they debt banksters subsidy for capital nice peaceful friendly society ubi might be considered not bad thing but it would still be unnecessary for contrast would encourage people look into idea of le salaire vie if you sort-of like ubi think concept of le salaire vie will completely cure you of your unconscious reactionary anti-worker tendencies but le salaire viec can probably only take hold already peaceful socialist style of political economy while we live under state sponsored capitalist system ubi becomes subsidy for capital it gives people means purchase output of capitalists ubi is extreme pro-capitalism will give credit anyone who admits this loves ubi because they are capitalist their bones dont be surprised if soi dissant progressive elizabeth warren starts supporting calls for ubi welfarist policy what would liz warren truly be saying something effect these poor workers who we unemployed are so retarded useless we simply have nothing good for them do so well give them their ubi then they can afford buy our crap.\u0026quot think about who gains power if bi is introduced ordinary person gains nominal purchasing power but that can rapidly get deflated away if capital has monopoly pricing power which is case many sectors either through outright monopoly or oligopoly worker now have my ubi goody but also want some healthcare at reasonable price sos can afford it yo capitalist piss off you blood sucker we gave you ubi from our taxes so doubly piss off yo leech get another job how does it work then alaska norway where ubi seems work reduce extreme poverty it is always case someone else is paying for it real terms norway alaska sell oil someone else is paying for that those costs are passed on workers somewhere else there is also environmental cost incurred currently unaccounted for it is significant real cost thats sort of cost that truly is going be burden for our grandchildren if decently paid worker alaska or norway would refuse accept ubi on principle imagine you would think that be pretty extreme so also imagine spiritual violence of psychological hypocrisy burden living ubi nation without decent wage we also know andrew yang version of ubi is tax on rich pay-for which is utter chimera rich people already have abundant savings they do not like getting taxed so will seek all means necessary reduce their tax burden which means real cost is always passed off onto poor ultimately even if tax pay-for reduced private wealth that does not limit power of rich they still will have savings so will still have leverage power this whole meme of good rich saying please tax me please is sad hilarious at same time if they serious theyd just give away all their spare cash why wait for tax man do it future prospects if you are one of those who currently support ubi are ignorant of mmt fair enough but please go educate yourself if you still support ubi do not thank me later for warning you about ills of ubi just your thinking alone makes me ill want nothing do you let alone your actual policy implementation do not want or need your thanks id rather you think for yourself work it out without bitter person like me tell you not sh1t all over working class if humanity sorts itself out more peacefully unity then we will see small job guarantee program every country expanded public sector employment for skilled workers do have some optimism about this because not everyone on this planet is batshit stupid even ubi shills are not necessarily greedy selfish people theyre just ignorant lazy their thinking can tolerate bit of laziness especially mathematical engineering programming kind which work their butts off today ridiculous degree just avoid harder work

reactionary society for me good scifi does same but looks ahead not just critiquing modernity today but warning of future dystopia cautionary tales this is powerful thing scifi writer artist invents alternative reality so can critique modernity without risk of defamation lawsuits its balancing act though critical artist wants make it obvious who they are attacking as regressive but make attack more severe it has be fiction too overt it veers into non-fictional satire hence open possible defamation actions suppose do not really know cases cite here pehaps there are none but certainly george

anti-capitalism from many angles have few pro-capitalism friends who are anti-kapital that is they favour private enterprise but recognize gross injustices of kapitalism qua marx ill leave that as stated let you figure out what mean \u0026mdash except add that capitalism is not one single idea of wage slavery it has flavours although all flavours are indigestible for hard leftie ive yet meet any non-tankies who do not admit some liberalism is necessary as both escape valves for individual creativity mistake-making important part of evolution ii expression of broad emancipation or no bosses means also no state authoritarian idea being democratic state exists legitimately only support labour \u0026mdash which means supporting public \u0026mdash because we should all be workers more people working for public purpose less hours any one person needs work by supporting labour this is support for private enterprise if private enterprise is not well-regulated by that one must mean what your society gravitates want as public purpose private pursuit then you have less freedom not more note this mmt derived stance is opposite of fetishising work \u0026mdash because we seek minimize works hours without reducing standards of living get rid of cruft of profit-driven capitalism i.e bullsh1t jobs by placing workers at centre of society we both minimise their labour hours maximise their importance this is what we want we want idolisation of proletariat not capitalist know where your bread butter comes from modern boss-farmer is not worker theyre capitalist we dont need em labour they employ are actual farmers who would be quite capable managers or some among them hierarchy organization is important but more worker cooperative or merely worker-centric model of production managers are workers workers can vote on who they want as manager treasurer organizational secretary so forth unstructured leftie workplace is disaster see story of contemporary debacle at leftist publishing outfit current affairs unstructured anarchic workplace is perversely anti-labour proper true left or left-populist outlook is that hierarchy should not be asshole creating power structure part way avoid asshole generating power structures is give bottom line workers vote workplace meaningful vote not sham of democracy like neoliberalism sound too militant for you if so have nothing else say you enjoy your libertarian capitalist dystopia im not saying kill your masters like posers such as killer mike am saying kill whole boss mindset.${}^\\dagger$ good workplace manager is not master they are comrade they help workers harmony produce goods we all desire consume by lowering burdens on workers so we can advance peaceful civilization ${}^\\dagger$ok that is probably what killer mike has mind too his lyrics are not be taken literally have assume lol as poser mike at least doesnt totally suck which brings me back quinn cyberpunk what wanted write about issue of why so much scifi is dystopian why heck is that makes for grittier stories yes think thats large part of it writer artists scifi have not really learned how write hopeful vein thats understandable given we live neoliberal dystopia counter-revolutionary critic will of course always point out how fantastic things are technological advances that only capitalism could have realised we have call bullsh1t

elements of mmt activist manifesto so allow myself such playful provocative language roche article am referencing from 2015 but he still attacks mmt today c.2023 so little evidence he has found enlightenment since background mmt discussion groups often topics of critiques of mmt are brought up one recently investment advisor dude cullen roche he is particularly annoying type who thinks or seems think keynes is be-all end-all of macroeconomics post-keynesians of course are highly prone mischaracterising gaslighting mmt straw-manning mt like because mmt grew out of pk economics forums went beyond pk father has some freudian death-wish complex for son \u0026mdash sort of thing have no idea really just seems that way sometimes maybe its more vader\u0026ndashluke complex thing job guarantee cause of unemployment this is something cullen roche did not comprehend he claimed mosler wrong but mosler is not wrong fact moslers point follows logically from definitions unemployment is defined as people seeking work exchange for state currency it follows logically that if government does not issue means pay tax liability then evidence is unemployment mmt point is government can always supply means pay tax if they do not whole system is default which is tragic policy mistake not only is it drag on economy put people precarity but there are massive social costs unemployment space of decade or so these social costs pathologies of unemployment are thought dwarf real costs of all wars all human history moreover unlike rebuilding war-torn city lost output from unemployment can never be recovered \u0026mdash it is lost for good what is source of desire work exchange for state currency it is imposition by state of all liabilities that may only be settled by payment state currency mostly this is tax liability private firms are not source of unemployment how can they be oh sorry can only employ one baker my shop should have employed three because two other people also want state currency bankers are not source of unemployment how can they be oh sorry should have issued more loans exchange for promissory notes but credit risk assessment meant can only legally make lone charlene not charlie should loan charlie anyhow because he is seeking state currency foreigners are not source of unemployment how can they be oh sorry did not buy lot of your domestic surplus this year ill try do better next time by depreciating my own countrys exchange rate wise non-stupid government only accepts their currency as tax redemption all bank credit extension is government spending why because banks are chartered by state bank credit is state licenced state currency issuance state is through agent bank purchasing promissory note repay that is state spending ok this is little subtle for monetarist goldbug heads grok but it is simple fact-of-the-matter it is clear then that means pay tax can only come from government point of logic not up for debate unless government is insanely stupid granted that could be case basic jg government issued more tax liabilities relative procurement needs for state plus private sector desires save evidence by definition is unemployment dollars not unemployment anything else this is policy mistake unemployment is not caused by private firms private firms seek produce output for sale as few workers as possible preferably zero wage workers not that enlightened employers know it \u0026mdash which is terrible tragic source of bullsh1t jobs tragic because such enlightened employers honestly want help people.${}^\\dagger$ government has only two ways fix this policy mistake lower tax liability or employ people they caused ot be unemployed problem is long term unemployed workers are provably undesirable firms firms prefer bid hire already employed people for obvious reasons its not necessarily callousness firm has make sales state can always hire unemployed worker if public service job is not clearly available then job guarantee scheme can be used mmt calls this fully employed labour buffer jg is superior price anchor compared ubi or unemployed labour buffer on fixed exchange rates or gold standard buffer is either gold or foreign currency or basket of currencies on such regimes you have full employment of gold you cannot guarantee full employment of labour on floating exchange rate buffer stock is labour you can have full employment of labour or use welfarism unemploy buffer but why do that it makes no sense it is unnecessary it is cynical psychologically damaging working class jg scheme does not need make profit but can produce useful output jg scheme can be government funded but locally administered meaning it is democratic not work-for-the-dole work can be envisaged realised be fulfilling even joyful why not micro-efficiencies are unimportant how many harberger triangles does it take fill one okun gap answer is helluva lot economic damage of lost output due unemployment is simply massive horrific compared all microeconomic efficiencies incurred from non-profit government employment guarantees choice government policy-makers have is between unemployed labour buffer fully employed buffer there is no good reason on earth choose unemployed labour buffer its dystopian creates welfare dependency which only further psychologically damages otherwise possibly good decent workers ${}^\\dagger$it would be better for workers for enlightened employers fully automate their production so they do not need employ workers but we all know most useful firms cannot do so so do not disingenuously attack mmt point of logic here if firm can automate sustainably they should common attacks come from ubi dorks workfare dorks workfare dorks jg should as matter of principle not be set-up as workfare why would you do that there are endless good things people could do for their community provided monetary profit motive is unnecessary jg makes profit motive unnecessary jg is not for public service employment pse if skilled worker desires work for public sector they ought be recompensed skilled level wage benefits not just as matter of justice but for stability too worker paid less than wage needed reasonably well live society becomes drain on other social services for no good reason ubi dorks bottom line any good for society anyone can do if given ubi is something they could instead be compensated for proper full living wage benefits so ubi is pointless it is dystopian we wake up every day severe labour shortage on mmtmacrotrader livestream we mentioned smartphone app be my yes so why should be my eyes volunteers not be eligible for jg wage answer is for no good reason further counters ubi-ism first couple of points about government budgets then decent but not exhaustive list of reasons no one should want ubi policy budget is best thought of as moral document not financial document governments neither have store of their tax credits nor do not have them they cannot target nominal fiscal outcome due huge amount of non- discretionary spending its big hurdle get citizenry thinking these terms more below but thats job we face its not as hard as moving mountains at least focus has be on real wealth not nominal distributing currency is means claim real wealth is matter of grave justice considerations ubi is far too indiscriminate it cheapens outlook of justice know all ubi arguments none work imho as you wish think except use bi as short term palliative ubi does not guarantee creation of real resources people need by design it cannot 3.a currency units for credits debts is not just for spending it is reciprocal relation always has been always will be who what is your ubi claim upon jg pse is superior you know claim it is your claim on state for your contribution 3.b at best nation decent ubi is claiming on output of labourers somewhere else often global south this is case wherever ubi is currently run people are ignorant of it they dont factor it 3.c so where exactly are you eliminating poverty only your own land if you are lucky avoid big inflationary impact eroding gains poor as matter of principled reciprocity it is always better compensate people fairly for contribution society no matter how small from each according their capacity each according their needs yes but only if real output not currency is there meet their needs 4.b there is no great bureaucracy job guarantee unless you plan it be that way it can be locally administered those local admin jobs good useful jobs they help determine fair distribution needs dont disparage them taxing off wealthy elites is harder than you can imagine unless you are wealthy elite so theres huge problem there solve before ubi can be regarded as fair jg avoids all that since it injects currency by just compensation only at base who other than sociopath would not want vote for that so think surveys also back this up jg polls well there is no democratic opposition it small limited bi pump up demand could be ok for while but you always need think about real output which jg does as does expanding skilled wage public service employment proper which should be paid fair wage not jg minimum theres already channel for increasing bi existing welfare benefits pensions easier get votes raise them than vote for money for all it is incredibly dystopian imho grossly unfair expect people produce useful output on ubi if they are doing useful work pay them decent living wage for heavens sake no one opposes this that know of who again is not sociopath if skilled worker is contributing useful output employ them public sector proper at above jg wage because why heck not there is no reason not dont leave them flounder on unearned basic income or superior jg wage floor you all know superior counter-cyclical effects of jg as opposed unemployed labour buffer so jg makes ore sense macroeconomically why then vote for inferior policy if we have jg jg wage can be higher if there is no ubi so do not see them as complimentary at all you have extract those taxes off wealthy but not only wealthy who only complain do not lose capacity spend sufficiently youd have tax middle class too there is no constituency for that but see this as problem for just equitable ubi you have be honest most ubi advocates outside mmt circles that have heard are not fully informed or id claim if they are then theyre dishonest about this possibly about some of above points is ubi truly easier get passed into law ok maybe but thats only good argument for ubi but thats country will never want live might be dooming myself as kiwi citizen here will admit sectoral balance critics cullen roche not one of jg critics know about although guess he could be thatd be because he doesnt understand mmt roches critique or one of them centred on sectoral balance identity possible abuse of identity by mmt proponents note roche does not disagree identity $$ g-t s-i $$ note take main critique be that roche thinks net government spending $g-t$ does not equate net private savings lets score roche on his rant against mmt roche private sector saving is not saving net of investment thats roches headline what does it mean is it counter mmt mmt response saving flow is $s$ investment flows are $i$ so indeed savings $s$ is not savings net of investment$=s-i$ so mmt agrees roche whats beef then can only think that roche comes across troll mmters or even sincere mmt activists who for legitimate sound bite purposes claim government deficits $g-t$ equate non-government sector net savings this is valid not all writing academic treatise it is not misleading use such sound-bites post-keynesians use similar related sound-bite investment creates savings is roche going also nit-pick that for me this is also legitimate sound-bite net saving is shorthand for $s-i$ event of trade current account balance $m=x$ do we have use jargon savings net of investment all damn time no so roche is being prick score $\\delta -1$ roche is being dork roche david graeber had popular video op-ed guardian other day which he appears be using line of thinking that is often commingled post-keynesian economics \u0026mdash modern monetary theory mmt unfortunately david made several errors his video because he using these mmt based misunderstandings mmt responded this but made same errors they always do no doubt graeber not mmt expert fact dork of ubi shiller cocked things up but mmt correction making same errors mmt response first irrespective of whether mmt response cited by roche correct or not they might have been simpleton mmt activists we should judge merit of roches critique on merit well well mmt response making same error bill mitchell doyen of mmt if ever there one no simpleton so this is going be interesting no scoring yet since no point of contention roche mmt response score $\\delta -1$ roche he quotes david graeber if government balances its books it makes it almost impossible for you balance your books\u0026mdash graeber guardian op-ed roche comments this statement is wrong misleading david’s error stems from something we see mmt on consistent basis where they depict economy through or sector lens cause of this error is result of mmt’s alternative definition of net saving roche goes on assert oecd definition of net saving net saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure he claims mmt consistently uses term different manner he then claims this is precisely what graeber does his video conclusion is simple \u0026mdash private sector net saving s-i is function of size of government’s deficit which leads one think that private sector cannot save unless government is deficit except that s-i is not net saving any traditional economic perspective s-i is saving net of investment it’s extremely misleading define private sector net saving as s-i because saving cannot identically equal s-i unless is equal zero given that investment is most important piece of keynesian economics economy it’s preposterous present economy this manner because investment adds private sector saving mmt response term $s-i$ is flow not stock at end of year whatever it amounts becomes stock of saving domestic private sector nominal terms for that year why because weve multiplied by time period one year convert flow stock this is common parlance idea of nominal savings so mmt is correct not misleading real savings is different story am not aware of any mmt proponents ever confusing two maybe few activists do sound bites but thats totally forgivable roche aught not be nit-picking activist simplifications feel itd be douchebag level finbro-ism because one persons spending is anothers income net of investment $s-i$ here is flow residual into domestic private sector pockets remember graeber roche are both assuming for simplicity net exports are zero so mmt statement is tautology true by definition so what on earth is roche getting at by being pedantic nerd nerd here ordinary average person street number their bank account plus wallet is what viscerally matters this results from that net of investment $s-i$ so there is nothing terribly wrong or misleading when mmt describes $s-i$ terms as net savings it is et savings you can say savings net of investment too but thats jargon for person street after investments are made pool of funds so-to-speak from which have have realise bigger number my bank account from is $s-i$ you might say but thats inaccurate since $s-i$ is accounting residual there is no pool of funds here banks can create deposits regardless of $g-t$ remember so all that $s-i$ represents is some demand for bank loans for investment or draw-down from past savings or retained profits for this years investments how much of that ends up staying domestic private sector its aggregate so cannot say my personal savings are achieved this way might have been one of thousands who sold real goods foreign sector who aggregate balanced by thousands who bought gods form foreign sector roche finishes by agreeing mmt keynes that savings are accounting records of past investment dominant endogenous money circuit this is true but still government net spending adds this adds quite considerable amount rche writes \u0026quot given that investment is most important piece of keynesian economics economy it’s preposterous present economy this david graber manner manner because investment adds private sector saving.\u0026quot \u0026mdash but who is preposterous here mmt arose out of post-keynesian analysis as superset so wed agree roche what is preposterous is roche thinks he is attacking mmt yeah like one attacks all blacks by punting ball into mid-field every chance you get btw could not find where bill mitchell says anything different roche blog he wrote on graeber piece guardian score $\\delta -1$ roche being prick privileged reactionary investment capitalist keynesian roche be clear about this private sector’s saving savings does not come primarily from size of government’s deficit fact there is absolutely no need for government be deficit if private sector desires net save mmt response mmt agrees government deficit is ex post accounting residual cannot be targetted it is not being used any nation anywhere boost private savings yet positive government deficits will boost someones savings somewhere regardless of fact most household savings derive from private investments firms often borrow form banks short run finance wage bill before they can make sales for instance graeber is naïve it should be said government austerity is not be found be peering at government deficit you need look at unemployment queue poverty rates wages share of profit not deficit if there is involuntary unemployment deficit too low but government cannot know this ahead of budget their role is use budget as moral document ensure full employment by advance approving discretionary extra spending not worry about deficit full employment policy firms households thereby *perhaps selling lot more foreign sector governemtn deficit might even reverse be surplus for that year all while domestic bank balances aggregate go up net nominal savings made score $\\delta -1$ we subtract point from roche since he is straw-manning mmt here roche mmt response score $\\delta -1$ roche mmt response score $\\delta -1$ roche addition assuming that small budget deficit or surplus is necessarily bad this ill-defined term leads even larger errors mmt response no one well-versed mmt studies ever said small government deficit is bad deficit is accounting residual if foreign sector chooses diss-save your domestic currency households could be surplus for year while governments non-discretionarily surplus position it is true on twitter other click-bait forums mmt activist might tout goodness of government deficit but you need take that context not be jerk about it like roche score $\\delta -1$ roche again gaslights mmt roche it becomes clear that fed policy interest rate changes qe can have substantial impacts on valuation of private sector net saving he is arguing mmters are wrong claiming monetary policy interest rate maintenance is ineffective mmt response mmt does not claim monetary policy has no effect mmt argument is that broad terms monetary policy is not effective at controlling inflation nor producing full employment mmt case has been made elsewhere but this topic you can also just use empirical evidence \u0026mdash which supports mmt not monetarism serious point at issue not that cullen knows it is what policy is more effective maintaining stable productive economy clearly fiscal policy is dominant not monetary who cares about asset re-evaluations if they are financial assets who cares if they are real assets re-valuations will be fairly marginal more important concern by far is existence of people who have no significant financial assets care about re-valuations of them re-value $\\$0$ $\\$0\\times 0.9$ oh no how terrible score $\\delta -2$ roche is acting here like privileged prick summary it always irks me that post-keynesians harp on about how private investment is so important sure but try stop it whats far more important keynes would agree is full employment regardless of other investment unlike conventional investments you can stop

academia what im really going do is indulge some reviews of bit of twitter banter unfortunately for sake of time limited resources mmt joke but serious ill probably have stick giving some hot takes but here at least get write more at length than tweet do have serious purpose though if you ever get into public or private discourse where someone seems genuinely engaged but just seems fail grok mmt might be starting get hostile hope be able give you some tips on how both diffuse hostility educate offer no guarantees my pedagogy credentials are pretty middle-of-the-road but hope you find this post useful if you have better ideas please let me know key principle of good education is that it has be two-way so dont teach mmt at people try learning them it is superior for learning first understand where other person is atand accept you might be wrong how many times have my mathematics students said something correct that miss-heard then started going off wrong problem solving direction myself too many times count on my fingers realize twixxer is by design not much good for learning people background mmt gets lot of friendly fire but these are often hardest bullets handle its friends you dont need who often cause more heartache than enemies you might desire here are some threads of both frenemy enemy fire might try address forgive me for naming names its unavoidable for finding these conversations if thats what we can call them on twixxer mob burphy \u0026mdash austrian school christian economist who purports genuinely want understand mmt \u0026mdash order destroy mmt we will find maybe he is one of our best allies if we take bob heart as respectable christian think we can go long way mmt my mind is very catholic${}^\\ast$ rullen coche \u0026mdash investor who purports understand mmt but quite often attacks mmt when he attacks he seems be straw-manning less ally because when you straw-man position you are attacking it is really toxic destructive healthy debate learning say this knowing might not be capable of representing roche correctly so will set up straw-man rullen coche attack that entity thats honest way straw-man consider argument not person so cannot say am criticising mr roche michard rurphy* \u0026mdash tax accounting expert uk very friendly mmt but he is so obsessed tax justice he at times misses point still ally because think for now banter between tax justice uk mmters is still friendly seeking unity ${}^\\ast$ catholic means of broad or liberal scope comprehensive but of course im using double-meaning me mmt is also source of good not of all good of course are you crazy but whatever is source of good is true religion ok so there is lot of null religion around most religion is null precise case it is not source of good aristotelian meaning this case good is spiritual aspect of knowledge wisdom mmt is that macroeconomics avoid persons would characterize each of these three frenemies ideological terms as austrian school objections mmt \u0026mdash these often boil down ok mmt is correct but we do not like system this is probably stretch but im going take it bob murphy gets close this at times then seems go astray post-keynesian critique \u0026mdash mmt born from post-keynesian study so absorbed all of pk economics pkers however seem like think they are still special so they often object mmt but fail appreciate mmt agrees most things post-keynesians would argue case of currency pegs or fixed exchange rate regimes rullen coche seems however have more distorted view which we will take look at tax justice objections mmt \u0026mdash might be over-simplification but im going go these folks accept mmt but they just hate \u0026amp loath warren moslers framing that taxation is coercive force that drives currency this all now mind as background ill repeat im amateur educational psychology but have lot of practical experience if great teacher id say more than amateur journeyman pedagogy expertise so take my advice grain of salt definitely drop me message if you have anything improve upon or add thatd be nice of you will just say please respect my naïve optimism about human beings know it is naïve but still think am correct get my highly non-naïve background youd have talk me for lot longer its only apparent naïveté because dont permit myself time expound at greater length austrian catholics mmt is too much government there are so many layers this one really wish had libertarian friend put my axe grindstone on this one here are some discussion points mmt is recognition currency is simple public monopoly this allows us as democracy choose size of government we want abstracting population citizenry like this is highly macro move so beware of nuance democracy is tyranny of majority so forth which have obvious defeater counterarguments\u0026mdash whats better alternative we do not fact have democratic governance anywhere world any major nation voting alone is not democracy so right size of government for given culture is complex thing that probably no country can perfect but mmt lens we at least get chance understand proper real constraints on bit of democracy we actually have mmt also empowers citizenry better fight for democracy we want you have know your demands know they are realizable not utopian mmt gives you this spades real resource limits money from mars weird attack on mmt confess not fully understanding because it is so lame ive never bothered interrogate folks making these arguments fully is based on null idea we need some real commodity settle debt obligations so \u0026mdash austrian argument seems go \u0026mdash governments cannot just settle accounts their iou because that is immoral somehow theyd better promise deliver gold real stuff this is utterly lame it misses whole point of mmt that currency is iou has always been iou never is anything else not all 6000 years of recorded monetary history government can peg gold or pizza or chicken wings or potato crisps but why there is no good reason on earth peg tax credit any commodity hard money thinkers simply have never grasped what mmt is saying here their ultimate retort is just well it is immoral thats subjective judgement not critique of mmt mmt response \u0026mdash it is certainly not immoral for authority impose tax liabilities provided it also issues means fully pay tax liabilities without causing residual unemployment also one might hope without using bullsh1t or soul-destroying jobs offer as ways earn tax credit there is zero need use bullsh1t jobs so itd be another horrific policy mistake it is not legitimate attack on mmt point out there is unemployment mmt response this case is simple unemployment people seeking exchange their labour for tax credits is policy mistake job guarantee is one way amend this horrific mistake if society at large democratically does not wish big government footprint they can lower tax liabilities however as warren mosler rightly points out there is hysteresis if government has past caused needless unemployment this damages people spiritually physically psychologically private firms regrettably but understandably do not like hiring long term unemployed so it is moral responsibility of government hire all unemployed their tax liability generated either expanded public sector employment or local community run job guarantee government does not get dictate jg work post-keynesians mmt is job guarantee \u0026mdash nothing more this is merely subjective opinion school of thought now known as mmt has blossomed beyond warren mosler bill mitchells original insights but even ogs not just doing jg nothing more no other economics school of thought begins currency being simple public monopoly mmt favours zirp \u0026mdash few other economics schools are proposing zirp fewer recognizer zero interest rate policy tends be disinflationary but whether this is new mmt is debateable but why debate mmt activists should not be out win sports contest here if other economists agree zirp then great mmt is not alone same jg keynes inherently recognized superiority of full employment over price stability but did not explicitly mention buffer mechanism also considered unique mmt is important point that central banks are not cannot operationally be separate nor independent from government if nothing else if only cb has mandate control interest rates they must coordinate treasury one critical mmt insight that sale of central bank bonds is same as treasury bonds \u0026mdash neither are funding operations both are interest rate maintenance operations no other school of economics acknowledges this yet it is critical for well-informed policy decisions it is funny that characters like rullen coche try assert mmt is nothing new or not big deal because it just re-packages existing knowledge but lets consider all above think you will find school of thought now known as mmt is so drastically distinct from any other mainstream heterodox economics that accuse mmt of being nothing significant is highly disingenuous or ignorant also if other economists are happy accept mmt positions call it their own im not going complain as richard feynman often pointed out context of science names labels of things are not what truly matter mmt is objectively superset of post-keynesian economics so if post-keynesian comes along claiming mmt adds nothing new their analysis why are they attacking mmt is that not some sort of mental autoimmune deficiency response disorder if theyre just saying mmt is pk then fine but then pointlessly quibbling over labels which want no part of let them have mmt insights yet high profile post-keynesians which assume we can take be not unfair representation of pk thought have written full blown articles attacking mmt proper so find post-keynesian absorption of mmt be simply null objectively currency monopoly should not need expand on this too much legally institutionally this is not debate point critique of mmt might be that nations do not act as if currency is monopoly but thats no fault of mmt its opposite mmt is trying tell people what case is if policy is not crafted legal reality mind then needlessly awful boneheaded policy may result foremost being needless austerity zirp advocating zirp is not unique mmt position but understanding why it works is beleive on floating exchange rate non-convertible currency natural rate of interest is zero not so on fixed exchange rate gold peg or other arrangement while mmters would love other economists acknowledge this they do not so this is clear difference could be considered another distinguishing aspect of mmt analysis jg its also about de-commodifying labour good response more marxist leaning economists is point out that not only is jg superior macroeconomic stabiliser they might not give fig it also is crucial for de-commodifying labour any monetary economy which includes capitalism socialism or any hybrid mixed system of political economy where state monetary system is use think it is simply no-brainer human beings are spiritual beings living material condition any moral economy should not commodify workers only political economies any inherent justice elevate workers most precious resources but if economy is monetary this needs be recognized job guarantee does this part expanding skilled public sector work for anyone who wants it is another complimentary part separate jg jg is provisioning for people who cannot find private sector employment but desire private sector employment jg is also buffer mechanism for price stability \u0026mdash important function for purely psychological reasons because for whatever dumb reason most normies even marxists seem hate inflation more than unemployment which is stupid but it is what is is jg cannot work most countries this one is just null even vastly scaled-down jg-lite has worked two of most corrupt nations around argentina india my mind jg works because it is locally administered its not top-down approach full employment local nature of well-designed jg program leverages human decency it uses correct approach moral economics \u0026mdash which is roughly that outlined by samuel bowles among others gist of which is that adam smith only half- right moral economy is paramount but governments cannot enforce morality or motivate moral behaviour by taking moral decision off people it never works well that way. another way of putting it simplistically might be that law justice system is for enforcing social norms not for legislating morals rullen coche has seemingly technical economic objection how jg can work he is wrong but best way not only way see that is through moral economy lens unemployment is far more severe economic problem than inflation besides jg acts counter-cyclically so it appears rullen coche does not quite understand this its hard say without interrogating mr coche directly but since he is straw-man im going say that is source of his misconception central bank operations usa cb tsy operations are little peculiar by law so mmt point conceded tsy is not permitted put scorepoints usd onto their balance sheet at fed banks particular tga account from which government makes mark-ups mark-downs spend receipt tax returns respectively this shenanigans regrettably promotes myth of fed independence which is sham that is probably by design though fiendishness of it is hard pin-point be generous lets call it ignorant fraud tsy skirts around this congressionally self-imposed constraint on consolidated government by auctioning treasuries primary dealers bid treasury swaps bonds for reserves fills up tga account then can spend borrowed money only is cannot have been borrowed where did primary dealers get usd ultimately from first place they can only come from past government issue or credit from another bank banks cannot lend themselves it is illegal avoid overnight cash rate tending zero tsy must thus first supply reserves for primary dealers purchase bonds auction they accomplish this reverse repo facility rrp that is primary dealers contract purchase bonds future next day often exchange for bank reserves tsy effect has purchased this promissory note if instead fed issues tsy bonds reserve drain or buys them reserve add economic effect is exactly same since rrp arrangement tsy can guarantee tga account is positive balance as technically required before government spending can legally take place issue of bonds is not funding operation it is thought be it is rather precisely same as effect of fed issuing bonds \u0026mdash which is that it drains reserves when government spends there is offsetting reserve add which means there is no pressure on interbank interest rate thus we see purpose is maintain desired interest rate floor this could also simply be set zero which case there is no need at all have rrp facility no need for either agency of government issue interest earning instruments aka tsy bonds zirp means debt ceiling fear politics can go away fear dread over government debt is about promise pay interest on bonds redeem coupon mmt will tell you this is never problem operationally because it is just whipping out computer keyboard marking up bank accounts debiting tsy accounts no grandkids or chinese financiers involved no tax payers involved although mmt tells you this superior thing note is that there is not need for government on floating exchange rate issue bonds first place so adopting zirp policy makes national debt disappear without debiting bank reserves or deposits fact from starting point today retiring all tsy debt going zirp policy will eventually add reserves after maturation of all outstanding bonds thatll be it \u0026mdash no more basic income from then on that only for people who already have money proportion how much money they have caveat true mmt style count all outstanding cash coins bank deposits as government debt because government makes promise redeem all those currency forms for payment of tax liabilities promise redeem is technically debt obligation of course it is trivial for government accept back its own currency so it is not debt burden but linguistically semantically it still counts as debt obligation negative tga balances there is final nuance here that not aware of until recently which is that tsy tga account fact does not have be positive government can still credit accounts purchase hire rules require positive tga account balance however there is policy or operational guidance for treasury fed officials event spending is immediately needed when tga account is zero instruction is enter negative number tga account which is mmt point currency is not commodity it is iou negative account balance is precisely mere scorekeeping \u0026mdash albeit economic consequences severe penalties for fraud which is why clerk cannot just arbitrarily enter negative numbers tga when marking up private back accounts they need votes from congress for spending endogenous money rullen coche seems believe faith based reasoning governments are using bank money all time think he falls for pk mirage here randall wray goes through endogenous money circuitist theories his aula lectures if you pay attention them you cannot come away believing mct or endogenous money those theories fail there is exogenous monopoly net currency supplier their currency is tax credit once you conceive of state currency as tax credit which has other emergent functions markets too then you cannot take pure endogenous currency theory separately why not it is because final settlement of obligations has involve trusted third party iou bank cannot use its own iou settle its own debt all nations on earth today every nation dont know maybe one exception somewhere trusted final means of settlement is central bank case of ecuador who employ usd their final means of settlement is us fed their central bank go figure crazy ecuadorian officialdom central bank is all nations today branch of government it is not independent beast libertarians never tire of arguing against mmt on this score but lets say they are merely wanting be right but deep down know they are wrong why is mmt right about myth of central bank independence being null myth it is because iou of banks are denominated state currency units any physicist who knows about measurement standards field of metrology knows what mean by this authority tells you what unit is you may use your own iou units but all banks everywhere today use state currency units not their own units good examples illustrate counterpoint are systems of money where they do not use state currency unit we have few of these running successfully real life franklin frank \u0026mdash crypto done right its fiat my dudes denison volunteer dollars dvd umkc buckeroo \u0026mdash goat of mmt systems these three mmt monetary systems authority is currency monopolist they define unit of account all banks these systems using authority money of account are acting as agents of authority settle their debts tax justice angle ive yet read latest from warren mosler\u0026ndashrichard murphy discourse apparently two of them supposed be hashing things out myself had some banter welsh guy steve keens online skool.com course since it involves similar issues ill take it as launching point am not 100% sure but whole issue might just be semantic objection harsh way warren talks about taxation as coercive force driving demand for otherwise worthless currency tax is coercive my mind mosler is correct but word coercion can be nuanced defanged it is coercive because empirically vast majority of people do not voluntarily pay taxes arent tax justice people being little unrealistic thinking people are happy pay taxes if tax is fair dont think it works that way maybe far future advanced spiritually minded society it can actually believe this tax could be voluntary but not today warren buffet for one is more than happy pay more taxes but thats not argument dude can afford by sectoral balance accounting identity most people cannot afford say they are happy pay more tax \u0026mdash itd impoverish their family cause mass unemployment but is that all this banter is about no there is at least one other issue is tax revenue funding spending rullen coche seems have this critique sometimes it reads as though michard rurphy does too as does mob burphy so all three typical attacks on mmt by otherwise friendlies get this wrong know mob burphy is avowed enemy of mmt but he just doesnt realise he is one of biggest allies of mmt he has done more than most people educate virgin mmt advocates so my mind he is weird friendly rullen coche is more interesting one perhaps idea is that taxation pulls real resources out of private sector into government sector true but here we are talking about real resources not currency lets take it steps first government imposes tax liabilities then people are unemployed they need exchange their labour or goods get tax credit otherwise theyll be going debt bank or stealing or counterfeiting government can hire labour or purchase goods because now people need tax credit so they will take it that has moved real resources from private sector into public sector it has also moved currency from government into private sector there is no motion of currency it is just credits debits taxes are then paid moving currency back government redemption operation not funding operation \u0026mdash real funding real resources has already been accomplished currency not yet used pay taxes remains economy as net financial savings of private sector nominal terms not real savings can it be so simple that post-keynesians simply have not got sequence right think so it is simple mistake they need correct their thinking tax is coercive is note even wrong this is last issue tax justice people like pull out some of them will say it is not about semantics of word coerce but fact that tax is simply not coercive think their reasoning is that you get choose what society live but thats baloney never had much of choice if immigrate somewhere itll still be nation using tax driven currency christine desan writes some interesting stuff on legal aspects of design of tax systems implying there is room for nuance wording say tax coercively drives demand for otherwise worthless currency is perhaps too harsh however it is still as accurate as can be for short one-sentence sort of length account of state currency addressed semantics earlier it boils down what you mean by coercive if people are not happy about paying tax then tax driven currency is coercive if people are happy pay taxes government issues tax credit so they can pay then you do not need call this coercive but it is still case that tax drives demand for otherwise worthless currency which means currency token itself never needs be intrinsically valuable which is massive costs savings real economy it just needs be hard reasonably forge or counterfeit which human civilization has managed accomplish again at minimal real cost if there are any residual tax justice people making objections at this stage theyre austrian school retards probably who think it is somehow spiritually immoral use currency that has no intrinsic value theyve completely missed whole point of desiring small footprint government if your stupid democracy forces your government onto

must be morally ethically driven fact it is not is more or less precisely what sickens us you dont really get sickened by corruption violence within crime family or syndicate you expect it you steer clear of it it is where corruption greed violence appear where they are least appreciated is what really sickens us better world more spiritual as opposed or complimentary technical education we might have less corrupt less greed-driven politics politics proper should not sicken us but attract us impulse do good it drives lot of good people into politics even when established politics is full of

bunch of dirt islands of rubble no disrespect their villages just caricature but it makes point ive heard several guests on dialogue works now advocate one-state two-state which is say discoursed of otherwise all well-meaning people is all over place such mess my dad rip worked haifa for peace had plenty of contacts israeli politics on all sides consensus there among peace groups one state main arguments being greater democracy justice but sachs is right appetite at political executive for one state is just not there yet likudniks can talk both solutions whenever it suits either attack or procrastinate just avoid doing anything for justice for dispossessed jeffrey then gave his justification for two states it is based on pragmatism he says one state is logical has merit but is not pragmatic because no one power wants one state solution say too bad for those power we need get rid of them posted this comment @540 on second thoughts think sachs proposal is ok first recognize palestinian state thatd be on paper though sooner or later it has be single united state \u0026mdash because that affords greater democracy justice for all by any reasonable pragmatic account palestinian territory currently given them would not be just would not be democracy as people like know it then made weak but think fair attempt at realpolitik justification new zealand we took

comments on demystifysci channel rush bit hot headed feel free contact me let me know if you think have something terribly wrong rents are not necessary what started me commenting when host guy tried correct keen by claming some rent is necessary overarching point is that no one should ever need be forced pay rent on necessities food clothing shelter electricity healthcare these are public services or should be so un-privatise them if your nation wants people be free charge rent between themselves for non-essentials well try it out but for heavens sake protect innocent from fraudsters banksters regulate banks la mosler’s proposals my comment @5800 host dude badly wrong here we do not need rents at least not for young couples seeking first home housing education healthcare should not be commodity see polanyi governments can always fund first home buyers have some of housing cost repaid as fair proportion of family income as tax not pay-for if house construction is slow none of this is tax payer funded because governments issue currency by fiat it is mere scorekeeping for government they impose taxes create demand for currency not supply government is supplier interview warren mosler on all this also commercial banks are all cases chartered by state they are for all effects simply agents of state they should be tamed as such because theyre dangerous beats bank should be regarded as public utility for running payments system nothing more except perhaps assessing credit risk but credit is again scorekeeping currency does not come form anywhere banks just type number into your bank account equal number on their books as asset which records loan promise repay banks have no business doing any other financial activity this is moslers narrow banking proposals keep banks tamed operating public interest not for-profit bankers could be simply salaried contractors if you want avoid excessive politicization or community trusts note governments never need pay for they issue currency by accounting entries they need instead demand for currency which is purpose of imposing taxes fees fines not pay for anything monetary terms its all about real terms for fiat currency issuer real resources not money its about money only if you have iou that no one wants so you need earn someone elses iou state currencies are ious of government they make people need it by imposing taxes primarily unless they are oil rich which case oil buyers take their currency il repeat talk warren mosler some elaborations on rentiers if older couple own house theyre not living then it should be taxed away from them if it is not occupied if they seek rent it government regulations should automatically kick purchase it off them at fair market value there is no tax payer or bank

proverbial one percent michael is being disingenuous about usa all usd issuing private banks are chartered by state they cannot exist without us state issue is who regulates them answer is oligarchs one percent bankers get regulate themselves as obama allowed point is obama c.2008 congress should not have allowed them regulate themselves nor should any government proper role of government is fulfill public purpose not private profit but itll be private profit government until citizenry seize back control of what aught be their citizenry government apparatus added bit more what mean is its not just china that has power cancel private debts for poorer households all governments can except eurozone who are no longer sovereign governments theyd rely on unelected ecb cancel debts but even there ecb could vote cancel private debts for poorer eurozone households it has be read shoudl be done fairly by little bit of simple accounting households that defrauded that is forced borrow use their credit cards from banks pay for electricity groceries etc should get their debt cancelled not households that took bank credit buy yachts condominiums or one-time debt jubilee could occur via prof keens idea give same lump sum all households but those debt have pay off their debt so it is automatic those without debt have invest real sustainable production according sustainable firm schedule also automatic they get shares only not cash however this does further needlessly enrich one percent so id apply simple debt jubilee cap if supreme benevolent dictator but this also

made near end on inability of sat re-score all tests citing itd cost too much money that came out of pockets of test takers thought why would they charge people for re-score if question known be bogus its ethics issue not finance issue sat board got ethics wrong cost is real terms \u0026ndash examiners could be doing something better or could they it is still public good be fixing badly scored tests monetary cost is then irrelevant government just marks up bank accounts of examiners who have re-score all tests fair compensation for these workers presumably they not ones writing bad question hopefully someone at veritasium takes note of my comment @1525 sat officials made another huge error of far more overriding importance fact epic tragedy cost of redoing scoring does not come out of pockets of test takers thats macroeconomic myth there is fact no such thing as tax payer funding no one can pay dime tax until issuer of currency first issues it or licences chartered banks as agents of state issue credit which is not net currency creation has be paid back interest tax payers cannot legally fund government monetary terms thatd mean theyre engaging counterfeit tax payers others fund government real terms by exchanging their goods or labour return that which is accepted for payment of taxes fees levies other imposed liabilities aka us dollars or yen pounds euro peso etc numeraire for whatever country imposes these liabilities by force of state only us government can issue usd by fiat they tell you what its worth cost is vote congress for authorization operation is simply taking computer at central bank typing numbers mark up bank accounts of employees re-marking sat test thats real cost terms of those employees could be doing something else more useful perhaps but it is not monetary cost for any tax payer fact issued wage for government employees gets spent presumably thus helping someone else pay their taxes reason why this error is epic tragedy is that it applies not just lack of willingness re-score sat tests but entire macroeconomy null thinking about tax payer funding is cause of neoliberal austerity policy massive wastes of human lives unemployment

university programs do need be place limited teaching resources all that but mit standford harvard other universities freely able publish lectures course materials online no paper printing cost whatnot do we really need restrict university placements perhaps we do after all chatgpt is showing there is still role for teachers it requires honest human work assess students for certifications if theyre able plagiarize chatgpt if universities are going continue as our main source of higher education qualification then standard need be met but information technology is constantly lowering real costs involved universities should be lowering cost of education not increasing it this is public funding issue also im talking about inflation adjusted costs so real costs if real resources we once had are still available they have be realistically total lot cheaper now so university fees should be practically zero real cost enter university do all formalities of accreditation should be intellectual cost you have prove you are worthy on that score advocate giving students all time they need there is no need for rush through college if they fail course once provided they wish continue

sat test did not offer correct answer multichoice most students would say it rotates $3$ times around since smaller coin circumference being $2\\pi 3$ unrolls $3$ times get once around larger coin of circumference $2\\pi r$ however this is not case while story about circumferences is correct it does not dictate full rotation of small coin around its center thats because addition unrolling its circumference around bigger coin smaller coin is also orbit so-to-speak around larger coin that orbit accounts for one extra rotation hence total number of rotations of small coin is $3+1 4$ generalizations cool thing veritasium episode is generalization rolling circle around any shape triangle square pentagon or even line scientific american had article going into issue for celestial mechanics why astronomers need use sidereal time not solar time for only one of these will small circle rotate around its center naive expected perimeter divided by small circle circumference number of times which one answer line of course no additional orbit what about rolling coin inside another shape this case inner orbit is subtractive you have subtract one circumference so result is ratio of shapes perimeter small coin circumference minus $1$ simple proof offered by mathematician who one of those students from 1982 proof using uniform speed parameterize path smoothly time so constant speed around say it takes $t=2\\pi r$ seconds center of small coin moves around perimeter $p_c 2\\pir+r n$ at uniform speed for its circular orbit which is $$ v_c \\frac{p_c}{t} \\frac{2\\pi n+1r n}{2\\pi r} \\frac{n+1}{n} $$ count number of revolutions of this small coin by counting how fast contact point must be moving call this speed $v_p$ for point-of-contact number of revolutions will be angular velocity $v_p n$ divided by $2\\pi$ times time taken $t$ n_\\text{revs} \\frac{\\omega 2\\pi r}{2\\pi} v_p $$ however we know what $v_p$ must be if there is no slipping of coin as it rolls around perimeter it must be exactly same as speed of coin center why is that so it is simply because coin is rigid imagine shrinking coin radius $0$ centre would then be contact point it has be moving at same speed another way see same result is calculate it directly thus $v_p v_c$ hence $$ n_\\text{revs} \\frac{n+1}{n} n+1 $$ prove result for case of rolling coin around inside of shape just start

need appreciate pretence that is apart from commodity traders looking make buck aprasitcally or jewelers or electrocnics folks few people needed gold so never redeemed currency for gold when you have omnetary system where people are not redeeming for gold any meaningful way you do not have gold standard but you can still call it gold standard era if there is legal prmiose redeem for gold ill give you that but that is all so can unashamedly post this sport of comment @500 that is myth it not truly gold standard it thought be but few states ever redeemed currency for gold paper claims on gold reserves regularly exceeded total gold supply at fort knox or wherever believe by several times over so this is not gold standard it political pretense at such impose worker austerity applicable as policy by justification because of fixed exchange rate regimes which are entirely unnecessary self-imposed constraints more austerity moving floating exchange rates meant pretense officially over but gold standard had been gone well before that move yet gold standard mindsets prevail form of fixed exchange rate mentality which is inapplicable today but policies designed for fixed exchange rates

he is doing good job opening peoples eyes ears but wish hed not continue being so coarse its ok talk nuanced terms not jar your audience all time but maybe its just my sensitive ears exponential growth he got me started about 10 minutes interview this is one annoying thing it always irritates whenever anyone outside of mathematics class starts talking about exponentials there are no such functions nature except for abstract fall off quantum or gravitational field amplitudes so monetary debt never grows exponentially if payments are not made interest is charged then your debt or net households debt will grow roughly exponentially for while until there is government fiscal injection repay or recycling from firm profits back into households or rich bastards extract bank credit distribute poor bastards workers unemployed one might vainly hope so what is actual debt growth curve growth curve balls firstly it is not always growing it is irregular one can only say household debt will grow when government debt shrinks or foreign net spending transfers decline accounting identities but it is true that general trend that causes recessions is weal sort of growth debt it can be linear power law or sub-exponential or for brief periods when no payments are being made it can grow exponentially one cannot really ever tell though since economic data is not fine enough for exact curve fit thus even when it is exponential growth for short run we cannot tell not worry though key idea from hudson is still correct which is that left supported by government fiscal spending households cannot simply work harder producing real goods for sale pay off their debt debt growth will out-pace real economic growth unless there is massive one-off price adjustment upwards some may nullly call this inflation so that nominal value of past debt becomes overnight insignificant compared tomorrows income thats damn right inflation is not necessarily bad thing if it is purely nominal terms purely effected just by increasing minimum wage only or public sector workers wage rate economic justice issue exponential increase private debt is problem not government debt but it does not truly grow exponentially due fairly regular predictable debt default bankruptcy olden times debtors prison problem that mechanism by which nominal debt reduces is that it is utterly unjust it is screwing lower income working class while feeding rentiers parasites general solution is what even that toff keynes knew \u0026mdash governments are monopoly issuers of their own currency so can always choose cancel debts that poor cannot hope repay it imposed upon them by fraud or banksters though some households are also simply idiots who succumb fraud sadly being run by-in-large by oligarchy supreme rentiers governments choose not help poor its political choice its always about willingness issue currency not capacity \u0026mdash since governments cannot run out of their own scorepoints aka dollars or yen euro pounds peso whatever all are scorepoints on balance sheets as far as governments are concerned its not backed by gold it is backed by power enforce tax liabilities thus you see guts of almost all economic injustice is government is not providing necessary incomes which are only way households can pay imposed tax liabilities still satisfy savings desires for that government has issue more net currency preferably by hiring people do do public good work that is limitless you cannot ever run out of public good work not even billion ai bots they always can without causing inflation governments do not get their own currency originally off taxpayers thatd be counterfeit by taxpayer nor do they borrow their own currency bond sales are interest rate maintenance operations not borrowing operations tax return is automatic stabiliser \u0026mdash tax return automatically rises when government deficit accumulating historical debt rises over time growing

equal opportunity which is anti-humanist essentially soulless nerds view of world we are all computerheads just need right program it is neoclassical economics fallacy all over again rational agent

have been very lucky for me have postdoc position doing exact same research as my previous absolute versus relative same speaker suggested around 10 minutes that real problem for young makes is they see both relative equality gaps closing but also their absolute standard of living seeming decline it is probable this is fairly objective over last 40 years but baseline baseline is not relative female standards of living but technology most young men have computers smartphones all sorts of empowering technology older generations never had so better off needs be relative technology baseline once we correct for technology then it seems good hypothesis me that standards of living of young men have declined they have work longer hours or more soul destroying jobs order put as much food on

younger generations have as much material stuff but at cost of psychologically crippling bank debt there is simply no good reason for this it is neoliberal political economy at its insidious worst if

ōhanga pai posts have two short succession this one could turn out juicier since it is complex topic occasion is coming across santa fe institute public talk on central planning comrades let’s optimize surprising rebirth of planned economy at sfi march 10 guest speaker francis spufford who wrote book called red plenty setting scene am pretty sure spufford is getting lot of things wrong he reckons soviet union founded on sort of communist fairy tale of merits of planned economy but as michael hudson will often point out all economies are more or less centrally planned question is whether they are centrally planned nebulously by wall street or your nations equivalent or public via representative democratic government or via autocracy secondary question concerns what methods each form of government will employ that makes huge difference if one of goals is efficiency minimum waste then there are serious scientific questions ask about which form of planning is superior think it is fair say economists do not truly know answer yet is aught also be fair say all economists should agree unemployment is massive waste of real resources that any economic system tolerating unemployment is not best one you could have. unfortunately this is truly crazy it seems most mainstream orthodox economists are quite happy thinking unemployment is not waste is their facts necessity for market efficiency only mmt can truly point out why this is null post-keynesians never could make argument against tolerating unemployment also fairy tale of soviets may have been thing hoped for future many soviets thought realistic but null myth about this is that soviets fact communists they not they never got even close any form of socialism from bolshevik get-go gun it hierarchical system anti-democratic ruled by powerful committee of elites armed secrete police all other police hence closer wall street lobbyist controlled usa government than say extremely large kibbutzim or like fairy tale probably real minds of many russians but they hopeless deluding themselves or perhaps not perhaps they innocently believed benevolence of central committee so not be faulted who doesnt want believe their government is benevolent thats rhetorical rugged individual libertarians who never had any parents need not answer same as any child you do not like learning your parents are stupid normal people nothing special about them except hopefully they love you nearly unconditionally am not invoking null government as household analogy here just analogy about internal power dynamic within given system initial reactions maybe wont get end of it but forn starters here my first reaction spufford really nerds out far too much intro wrong when there is monopoly issuer of sovereign currency there is no free market there is secondary market that is free enough determine relative prices but macroeconomics price level can only come from one source government whether you like it or not monopolist has either fix price let supply float or fix quantity let price fluctuate or some mish-mash hybrid out of sheer ignorance which is case today all governments there is only one good choice for macroeconomy which is fix price allow supply float which means government deficit float is not targeted instead full useful employment is targeted using job guarantee as floor point is monopoly currency issuer can always determine price level e.g using automatic stabilizers progressive tax brackets for currency withdraw job guarantee for base currency supply at fixed price net government spending less tax return is net financial wealth states unit of account of rest of economy at this macro level it is not complex system it is monopoly it is complicated because of political psychology inherent power dynamics controlling monopoly but it does not have be either 100% planned nor 100% anarchic its political choice have unemployment massive waste of real resources lost output that can never be recovered wrong choice usa most nations we have oligarchy not because government is weak per se nor because government is beholden market forces but rather more because oligarchs control government it does not have be this way it does not have be centrally planned either if you understand monetary system you can design any sort of social economy you desire id suggest proper democracy full employment non-bs jobs which is nowhere be found felt had follow-up any decent economist who understands dynamics so is not enthralled by neoclassical equilibrium mush-brain thinking non-linearity will know why job guarantee is not inflation risk rising government net spending is also not inflationary if given growing population growing population must have growing money supply otherwise there will be widespread bank credit issuance which is major instability without mechanism for debt forgiveness debt that cannot be repaid is credit that fraudulently or ignorantly issued heated-up economy monetary circulation terms not necessarily energy use does not lead nominal inflation if higher circulation results automatically higher tax redemption which it almost always does unless rich have conned government into getting themselves zero tax rates interest-income by trillions moslers 7th dif higher government deficits today can cause higher tax return tomorrow this is not myth it is true myth is that it is bad thing truth is it is good thing higher tax returns no change tax code is mere signal of stronger economy tax return does not fund government when government is original issuer of currency by fiat tax return is redemption operation not funding operation or for simple-minded taxes do not finance government spending it is imposition of tax liabilities that is import this drives demand for otherwise worthless token scorepoints bank accounts these days money thing is worthless unless it is redeemable governments have never defaulted on these redemptions why would they refuse return of their own currency answer is they might refuse order not withdraw too much currency from circulation because they desire strong economy but this refusal could simply be lowering tax rates yet our times little do politicians know this is reason lower taxes politicians who think taxes fund government are essentially evil form of gross ignorance same treasury bonds these are entirely pointless instruments when currency is on floating exchange rate on float there is simply no need for government offer risk-free savings asset thats because when on float government does not need sell bonds lock-up its own currency for term stabilize exchange rate exchange rate is floated function of selling bonds is set base interest rate but this is nothing but basic income but only for people who already have money proportion how much money they already have so it is highly regressive stable policy is zero interest rate ensure licensed banks can do nothing but assess credit worthiness run payments layer so hold check accounts term deposits thus ensuring banks cannot issue fraudulent credit market can determine interest rate above government base rate of zero but then

value what wray has say on use of monetary unit communicate economic value amazingly there door wray left slightly open labour theory of value is not total value wray does nice job summarizing marx not monty python proust way although that would have been cool too someone should do that skit he leaves out lot of steve keens contribution which is unfortunate but its ok for beginners follow are some bullet-point style further summaries they are essential points of note before reading rest of my post marx did not understand money he borrowed too much uncritically from ricardo adam smith even little bit of bad thing can be bad thing mathematics one little error can destroy entire edifice thus when doubt you use probabilities not didactic statements as if you are boss of all economics philosophy marx played too much boss gold commodity is not states monetary unit so cannot be source of price level one might estimate labour time energy dig gold out of ground but this is laughable theory of how price is determined one cannot use single operation or process prices are always nominal gain social currency only when pegged or gauged against some common real process digging gold out of earth is not common enough process for decent theory of monetary value this renders most of marxs analysis of money form ridiculous obsolete all real value is derived from combination of free energy labour fair political economy relative real values would be reflected nominal value latter is currency unit of account all current political economies there is no fairness nominal values do not correlate well relative real values prices are not entirely random but relative ratios are heavily distorted by those who wield undue political power over others nevertheless only one relative value that truly matters is price of labour but this is not saying ltv is correct what is morally true is that fair system workers would be fairly compensated so their labour would be accurately valued nominal terms by comparison real output entire system can produce if it is not possible measure real output it can still be estimated statisticians decent econometricians are not total dummies hence workers can always be granted approximately fair compensation disgruntlement at edges although something be minimized is not completely terrible thing have tolerate if alternative is autocracy principle says that if it is possible measure real output within reasonable uncertainty bounds then workers can always be granted wage commensurate their fair share of that output this cannot be market determined point says wages cannot be market determined this is because markets distort relative prices whenever there is accumulation of monopoly pricing power such cases monopoly currency issuer has moral obligation make workers whole this is because as mmt shows monopoly currency issuer is price setter not price taker they do so by providing wage floor via job guarantee jg policy is not merely economic pragmatism it is also moral pragmatism bare minimum moral economic policy defining unit of account is remarkably similar defining engineering units like kilogram or second or metre ampere only because governments people who run them have no clue about this they turn what should be exact isomorphism into less than mere analogy they do not even think of state currency unit such metrology terms but they should this stuffs up lot of things society so much is f$\\ast\\ast$d up fact that it is epic tragedy as biblically epic dont blame marx for this epic tragedy everyone who sucked-in by adam smith ricardo is blame \u0026mdash so millions of people can be blamed yeah would say millions thats on low side you should not follow tradition unless you carefully scrutinize it find it agreeable true kind honest adam smiths economics came from good place he moral philosopher but that does not make analysis he handed down marx any more honest or good healthy swallow marx may have had deep abiding concern compassion for working class but because he morally righteous this respect does not excuse his careless uncritical acceptance of large chunks of adam smiths thought could say same for mmt we should not uncritically accept mmt analysis you need always take mmt analysis as fresh have they considered political power have they considered spiritual economics kindness altruism compassion sacrifice ecological sensitivity if not then id not want give it any credence or attention no matter how correct analysis monetary system comprehension some comments through open

opinion fact this works wonders for dialectic any ideologue of any colour or stripe yes even libertarian lol you need understand where they are coming from make effort talk peace thoughts on theory of value @2430 this leaves some territory open for me blog about wrays version of ltv is fine for what it is but real world things do not actually trade over counter according ltv plus you are missing keen \u0026mdash not all real value put into real output is from labour fact these days labour is minuscule amount meaning you need look at how energy is produced using all that dead labour free energy from nature better give this proper name like total energy theory of value which accounts for both labour free energy lets call it tetv lets say we all know lower level workers are grossly under-paid tonne of commodity is way over-priced sometime ridiculously van gogh or gucci thing etc on top of ltv we have tetv but on top of tetv we have tstv total social theory of value \u0026mdash which accounts not just for labour free energy but for people who have more social power who are able monopolize sources of free energy primarily land sun light that shines upon land those people have huge say determining monetary unit exchange value if given too much power they can completely subvert more natural ltv which discounts natures free energy can make workers pay through nose for simple commodities necessary for humble decent non-ostentatious life it begs question when reading marx derivatives what heck good is ltv when all socially important factors living decent life are completely subverted price by political power answer is ltv is only good for stupid nerds who like idly think about toy model \u0026ndash what if political power had no say price determination \u0026mdash completely useless thinking time robot theory of value about 26 mins wray talks about various other theories of value our times we should be looking at oil theory of value\u0026quot mechanized future perhaps robot theory of value that all sounds nice good but what does it really mean wray correctly answers that if we are serious about realistic economic analysis \u0026mdash fair distribution of total output \u0026mdash then we have have theory of how real output gets produced this implies both labour energy theories if we ignore factors going into production we have incomplete analysis theory of inputs is also necessary because none of inputs production are self-replicating self-sustaining energy systems need maintenance also periodic modernization labour needs caring social fabric healthcare if robots are self-reproducing then who really needs theory of robot value what we would require is theory of robot control then this theory must be implemented or at least best theory we can come up it is no good having self-replicating robots if they only serve top ten percent leaving us plebs free fight over scraps over robot surplus it should be then clear that proper theory of value cannot ignore moral dimension yet all economics theories of value ignore moral dimension marx did come closest moral economics such scifi future which god willing may become sci-fact we will still need labour theory of value even if humans are doing far less work have far more leisure we will still need be working hard help each other whatever way even robotic assistance all around since we would have been creatures who created robots we aught not relinquish our status as creators there is simply no need be nihilistic about roboticized dystopia where humans become extinct due our worthlessness such nihilism is patently absurd yet nor should we go other extreme grant ourselves lordship domain over nature nature bats last so is always ready so-to-speak humble arrogant setting quantity not price wray makes good point about 42 minutes many cases governments are setting quantity not price we want 50 new armoured tanks this year for local kindergarten bosses will use school or kindergarten as example of public sector organization but discussion is supposed be generic this can be ok if quantity is indeed appropriate target issue mmt has policies of setting quantity targets for everything is that is is plainly bone-headed why set quantity of employed labour when fact you can always employ all idle wiling labour set floor price there is no reason not unless you fail understand monetary system private industry cannot provide such labour guarantee only monopoly issuer of currency can provide that guarantee by all moral accounts it should implement guarantee but even case of kindergarten teachers government should not be fixing quantity because they cannot control these things government mostly does not use birth control methods cannot control how many new children there will be going kindergarten next year best policy is allow quantity float fix price then supply currency needed this way kindergarten bosses can purchase all play equipment they need keep children happy this however leaves problem if kindergarten managers are given currency meet their purchasing demands supply of materials is still finite so there must be some rationing system place if that is market then there is price bidding which risks inflationary distortions power dynamics but if every kindergarten has same purchasing power per head of children then this solves problem hence need for budgets if schools are bidding reasonably fair market so there is some competition between suppliers then government need not worry too much about fixing price can permit schools purchase what they need at market rates inflationary risk of such markets is pretty minimal although government is providing all currency without explicit constraint their allocations school are per capita of student so there is always implicit currency constraint when funding agency is monopoly currency issuer budget is not supposed be nominal currency units it has be or should be real units fair share of each kindergarten is per head of children real terms government merely provides whatever amount of scorepoints are needed purchase resources at fixed price for governments budgets are moral resource constrained documents they are not monetary constraint documents all monetary constraint budget is implicit known only after fact there is still room for corruption supplier of toy equipment might become monopolist so might demand higher price than is fair but government can always pay price so affordability for school is never problem problem is political since that higher price could sometimes lead one-off upwards price adjustment some people mistakenly call this inflation be that as it may it cannot cause hyperinflation however it is still potential political corruption problem government have means deal this by properly fairly regulating private monopolies those private firms are after all using state services particular they use states currency something fair should be demanded return concerning conforming reasonable corruption-free business practices or is rule of law only for those who can afford it monetization this very good portion of discussion wray points out that mmt activists are going have hard time insisting government determine price level thats because even if government policy determines price level it is never clear most ordinary people this is what is happening bank credit systems governments also cannot control quantity of money which makes market price control very difficult for government truly use mmt control prices within reasonable inflation bounds governments will find they need better regulate bank credit you cannot let bankers loose they are dangerous beasts\u0026quot as mosler likes say people look around themselves think they want money buy car or groceries or get their netflix they do not ordinarily consider real reason they need currency is because government has imposed tax liabilities mmt is difficult position of stating fact about monetary system that most people cannot easily see like scientists before atomic theory become recognized widely accepted that remarkably really only after einsteins work on brownian motion \u0026mdash well after john dalton doubly frustrating is that once you learn mmt concept is not difficult understand monopolist always dictates price they cannot help it one way or another they can allow market set price by fixing quantity but it is still monopolists choice of pricing policy people generally fail see this case of government currency systems but it is plainly true government is price setter one way or another meaning that it must follow from government policy what governments tend not get involved is then relative price of goods government is not supplying this permits secondary market form exchanging goods states unit of account but at prices determined by relative market value like voting your wallet\u0026quot it is not fair system because some buyers have more purchasing power that is unearned privileged rich so it is never truly fair market if richer people earned their currency then itd be different story if one is contributing mighty amount into economy one might expect greater share of purchasing power as simple matter of justice but no one can possibly physically command thirty times purchasing power of some other worker no one can possibly work that hard inflation bogeyman wray brings up tired old stupid-mmt line about inflation being problem had comment @4600 problem is not inflation inflation is continuous increase price level government would have be paying continuing higher prices thats not realistic source of inflation is elsewhere mainly interest rates basic income for people who already have money corruption supply constraints monopoly power \u0026ampc inflation is political psychology problems \u0026mdash tends get you voted out of office \u0026mdash but its not that bad of problem most economics voters tolerate bit of inflation what people care far more about is work income support themselves rising prices problem is always unnecessary unemployment if we had decent non-bs jobs full employment eventually no one care about inflation they might worry for little bit but eventually theyd get idea what matters is how much your entire earned scorepoints can purchase not what one dollar can purchase.\u0026quot capitalism is worse than marx thought wray did his usual spiel about how keynes veblen marx not too dissimilar marx wanted end capitalism keyens wanted save capitalism but both reasonably sincere enough reach same conclusions about macroeconomics only marx being more of idiot about money keynes being more of idiot his eugenics my comment @5000 capitalism is not m-c-m no capitalist know wants only more money they want other goodies for peer prestige as much as they need more money so it is m→c→m it makes it more disgusting than marxs model not only are capitalists sucking up rents get more scorepoints they also hoard real goods real estate electricity transport all rest they also produce more of waste per head so correct symbolism is m→c→m+c+w where

payer dollars here fully funded means employing all available journalistic media content creation resources for public purpose it does not refer finding money finding money is never problem also

talking about government debt as bad thing loose my sh$\\ast$t ill spare details just link talk here my comments @3500 someone did not read much history state debt has never caused collapse of empire states deficit is its citizens surplus by accounting identity it is good thing all else equal what happens empire collapse is either massive corruption or monetary systems something like massive private debt which means if state is deficit some oligarchs are holding enormous amount of currency equal private household debt plus government deficit these are only scorepoints though as far as state is concerned but banking systems tend be pretty rigid by law if private debts of poor especially farmers are not forgiven then you get revolt you also get economic collapse but it is not because of debt of sate which is private surplus it is because too much of that currency outstanding not yet used pay taxes is held by too few who are hoarding not spending it is gross inequality which is instability not debt of state state that issues its own scorepoints is never broke can always pay its debts \u0026mdash its own currency cesar could have stamped trillion aureus coin \u0026mdash metal value of coin is not face value state currency has always been scorekeeping system there is then inflation risk but that never causes collapse of state since you only get nominal currency inflation if you have booming economy or have something crippling supply like famine drought or war reparations imposed it is surprising yanis is using monetarist understanding he has friendly mmt colleagues but seems not have learned much from them then he talked about trade imbalance crying about how usa has been only nation able run massive current account deficit gets more imports than it exports because it has global reserve currency status @3800 that is such bs australia has sovereign currency can run deficits too you send away uranium import smartphones teslas if you are smart government deficit is irrelevant except political psychology it is ex post accounting identity bigger it is wealthier your people or if foreigners are holding more aud then more customers aussie firms will have sell without customer doing forex swap yanis seems be imbecile when it comes state currency operations reason usa gets away huge current account deficit is because foreigners are stupid have insatiable desire for holding usd but is desire for amount of aud held also insatiable sure it is you cannot give me enough of your aud if hold your aud am not causing any price inflation of aud goods either give me trillion aud can still use more if rashly spend it all blitz im only harming my interest you guys keeping your prices low like yanis but he can be such idiot it harms working class perpetuate deficit myth it kills poor it emboldens wealthy tax payer \u0026mdash who is not entity funding government as yanis just said before its other way around out or 10 musk bezos gates scorepoints came from government what he neglected say is other 10 also came from government via bank credit all banks issuing credit are chartered licensed by state government is source of all state currency anything else is counterfeit follow-up what he really means is dynamic of superimperialism michael hudson explains this much better usa has learned even though they do not comprehend why that government deficits do not matter what matters is real terms of trade \u0026mdash exports are your real cost imports real benefit if you can get foreigner send you mercedes cars return for scorepoints at fed bank you are winner usa just learned this before most others yet their politicians including kissinger still do not understand why it works think it is this thing called global reserve currency \u0026mdash which is meaningless concept state currency on floating exchange rate bank reserves are for payments clearing they do not fund anything treasury bonds are interest rate maintenance operation not funding operation or other words basic income but only for people who already have money proportion how much money they already have when posting t00bs am always aware some nerd will quibble but while dont have time post whole essay tend get sucked into covering some lose ends or vacant bases do realize if real dick you gave me trillion aud then probably would not care about your durable goods prices id buy up whole lot of them hoard it all wait for price sky-rocket then sell it all yet this still does not collapse au economy your government can still purchase anything for sale aud including all idle aussie labour had forgotten mention yanis used old lie about usd being global reserve currency also usa only had global reserve currency status under gold standard bretton woods agreement quasi gold standard \u0026mdash usa promised redeem for gold but only foreigners believe us citizens not allowed buy bullion after 1935 but even under bretton woods currency not gold it merely redeemable for gold like tax liabilities bretton woods ended 1971 72 ever since then usd is same as any other state currency like ukp yen renminbi aud or nzd those who float can allow government deficit float it is mere accounting residual of no economic consequence sadly it has negative political psychology repercussions which is simply null consciousness deficit myth deficit myth tax payer dollars myth are two of most diabolical popular memes that kill hopes for working class be free forever from bullsh*t jobs mass unemployment on technofeudalism thesis only had one comment @1600 at this point do not know if yanis will get around it but id also hypothesize techno-feudalism eats itself you cannot stop tinkerers hackers from removing those chips from tesla or subverting

are world peace optimist over at neutrality studies pascal lottaz replayed commentary by retired uk ambassador craig murray here usual good stuff said from peace activist perspective but tainted all usual pessimism doom always find pascal be good counterbalance nihilists but he tends say things straight-up so is not wildly optimistic nor idealistic either you could say lottaz is bit of soul mate goodness knows need few inspirations for world governance principles today want put down writing for posterity here on this tiny corner of internet few thoughts about world government while these are my own opinions they did not spring from vacuum can credit shoghi effendi baháʼí for most of inspiration they are tragically little known but if you want some serious spiritual political economy then youd be doing yourself favour reading some of shoghi effendis writings they are probably bit heavy going for materialists since entire basis of baháʼí philosophy is show spiritual virtues through action not just words basis for most baháʼí thought is harmonic duality between our physical life our spiritual life short everything exists for spiritual purpose physical world is testing ground place for spiritual growth what is spiritual purpose though simple but not too simple answer is that purpose is for soul grow spiritual capacity all that means is become more honest more kind more compassionate more just more loving more forgiving more trustworthy more humble face of ones fallibility all rest more knowledgeable is good too but more wise is even better you could also call this meaning of life it is not bad definition if purpose is meaning meaning is purpose think it is good definition yes social construction is thing how you go about meaning purpose of life will depend upon your context your culture your family your learning baháʼí concept celebrates such sociology while acknowledging there are still spiritual universals that are platonic some sense trustworthiness is foundation for civil society any civilization even non-sentient extent trust can be so defined can define trust non-sentient system it means obeying laws of physics all of non-sentient nature we know is trustworthy respect quantum mechanics but not respect classical mechanics \u0026mdash context those who do not believe platonic type of reality of spiritual verities or who think these concepts are merely socially constructed are going find it hard get through even few pages of shoghi effendi but think vast majority of people on earth would find his work illuminating having noted all that would say writings of shoghi effendi are not really meant for public consumption they presume familiarity baháʼí faith if you lack that understanding then think youd be missing too much as something of bridge hope build little bit of scaffold from popular progressive liberal-social democracy ideals these principles of world government articulated by shoghi effendi if you dont like look of bridge feel free not cross it brief comment agreeing lottaz old school nice twitter style posted comment below pascals video clip tried best summarize as few words as possible bare minimum basis for world government this is such important issue international governing body has be legitimized by mass of ordinary people not become just another layer of wealthy elites control this context beware of right-wingers libertarians who scream about globalists incite fear of world government they are types who love authoritarian control namely themselves over their own land resources but cry like babies when large section of society desires democracy point having world government is precisely as pascal describes it would have clear limited demarcated purpose enforcing agreed upon evolving fit-for-purpose set of international laws would not should not any reasonable sense erode individual nation sovereignty other words it can never be should never be allowed be neoliberal neocon institution since that would entirely defeat purpose give just cause right-wingers libertarians who fear world government this leaves lot unsaid short of long essay what can add round off commentary prerequisites exist one principle is that world leaders body politic general might sometimes be successful pushing through policy before groundwork has been laid thus hard prerequisites for political implementation rarely exist but there are lot of soft prerequisites one of these occurs palestinian\u0026ndashisraeli conflict will only mention here policy choice between one state solution two state solution my father something of expert on middle east politics towards end of his life having moved top level circles israel as diplomat for ngo baháʼí world community he changed his view over time one state solution citing immense problems of settler colonialism zionism which cannot just be swept away by authoritarian dictate he preferred see democracy homeland for jewish people perpetuity for sure but shared all other people of land we are not so unaccustomed this new zealand we are proud be multicultural but we are also fiercely bicultural māori people will always have special place new zealand politics this is part realization of irreversible changes world civilization cultures will not be lost anymore you cannot destroy significant culture these days no matter how hard you try there are too many archivists whole lot of digital memory resource put it crudely however what prefer say current times is that for palestine\u0026ndashisrael there is no $n$-state solution for any $n$ until people of land are prepared live together peace harmony if people of middle east are prepared live together peace harmony then there is $n$-state solution for any $n0$ decision on which $n$ is suitable then becomes democratic choice after sufficient debate deliberation if israelis are prepared clear real estate they have settled say post-1967 map then perhaps $n=2$ state is possible harmony if not then $n=1$ state would be choice imposed by israelis precisely because they are unwilling abandon real estate but then entire world had better impose upon israel true democracy for people living land that means equitably sharing existing housing land water all such basic resources for life here is another prerequisite how can you possible think of entire world imposing democracy upon israel\u0026ndashpalestine one state you cannot united nations has not earned that legitimacy will not be trusted while security council veto power is place entire un has first become true international democracy of nations one nation one vote for that same reason \u0026mdash since per capita this would look like skewed democracy which it would be \u0026mdash powers of un have be strictly limited un can never be allowed infringe on domestic sovereignty of any one nation this is price un must pay for one country one vote un will never be able resolve all conflict however un can always be granted wide ranging diplomatic power un diplomats would be protected violations of such protection would have have severe repercussions such as right of all other nations rise up against any nation violating un charter this should not be controversial violating hypothetical future un charter nation is choosing deliberately knowingly cede their sovereignty manner prescribed by charter since it is not yet written cannot say exactly what degree but would imagine ordinary citizens of nation would no way be oppressed by un who is holding up peace middle east \u0026mdash united nations is many others but immaturity of un not existence of un is my estimation biggest obstacle all m.e peace efforts past have been as lottaz put it basically anarchy not of good kind he means disorganized lacking cohesion as well as infested corrupted by powerful vested interests militarism unipolar hegemony like so yeah basically anarchy of right-wing anarcho-capitalism variety \u0026mdash who has most power has all say we all need realize this is unstable state international politics it cannot continue but we do not know what characteristic time scales are international politics is not science case polsci nerds material deterministic marxist wondering because state of international geopolitics is unstable there is always chance for disruption of huge importance for good or for bad ordinary citizens of world are however not powerless tilt bias changes for good how critical thing is no one citizen of world can do very much but together we can do amazing things sound too commie for you

safety prosperity anyhow left this comment for nima his audience @2230 when you can so easily blend indigenous like lloyd austin this is not so much deep state it is open transparent corruption of entire nation usa is this wise no more republic nor democracy than iran or nth korea there is only supposed be two layers separating mass of us citizens from who gets appointed deep state \u0026mdash their locally elected officials primary elections which create pool for election of those representatives reality us citizen has no say who gets appointed deep state because they really have no say root level of primaries it is deep for sure sense of ingrained infested liars psychopaths but deepest rot is at base level your electoral system how anti-democratic it is one very reasonable measure show it democratic necessary but not sufficient would be probability distribution of prior earned income of representatives itd be gaussian centered on about average us worker wage there is little paradox or irony here your base level of sham democracy is controlled by top level usa all other neoliberal run nations need remove that top level control seize back state is not call for violent revolution nor overthrow of government it is call for non-violent means seize control of base level usa that would be primaries so you get fair say who gets on ballot.${}^\\ast$ never think that this deep state is solely consequence of idiocy or greed-for-power of your government representatives usa as collective people led by not so pure saintly small group of founding fathers once had good idea establish representative democracy but never actually managed implement ideal we cannot blame average us citizen for present diseased state of us politics but we can sure as heck blame every single person agency usa for not lifting finger do something about it their own small insignificant way e.g by engaging family friends on these issues generate groundswell for non-violently overthrowing neoliberalism its mont pelerin bred ilk \u0026mdash because it is only small actions of all people working together harmony that can erode such corrupt system unless you are all prepared sit idly by wait for accelerationism work its havoc through more poverty death by neoliberal austerity ${}^\\ast$note that other countries it is actually harder than this new zealand could find it harder than usa destroy neoliberalism from grass roots we do not have open primaries we do have proportional voting but it actually entrenches importance of political partisanship you have be party insider have say who gets on ballots mcgovern mentions poverty ray said there is passage bible where mary speaks something about jesus coming fill up poor riches leave rich without he interpreted it literally which is always sad mistake interpretations of any holy scriptures should be at first allegorical if you want overlay some literal meaning youd better be careful since as enlightenment supposedly taught common people literal interpretations make scriptures inconsistent my autistic suppose naïveté thought everyone understood this do not talk people enough know much popular conception opinion my comment @33 cough that not really what biblical scripture teaching idea jesus would fill up poor riches of kingdom \u0026mdash meaning spiritual virtues which are far more valuable than material riches for they are how decent civilization endures for all not just for one if you focus on material wealth material riches you will miss 99% of meaning holy scriptures of all denominations point being material prosperity is terrific too but you only achieve that justly for all people spiritual prerequisites \u0026mdash trustworthiness honesty compassion love kindness forgiveness when we achieve fair prosperity for all counter mainstream economics ideas rich disappear not because god or marxists vanquished them nor keyness ghost euthanized them but they disappear because they become nothing but middle class \u0026mdash but willingly because they too gain spiritual capacity so spend their wealth upon poor however charity does not eliminate poverty only governments can eliminate nominal poverty deficiency of tax credits since government is always monopoly issuer of tax credits either by fiat or by state chartered banks through credit circulation governments are direct cause of nominal poverty but little do people running government know if they did know they would also know how immediately eliminate all nominal poverty their currency system causes by employing for public good all people seeking exchange their labour for tax credit who cannot find employment private sector point of all that is note we will never have decent governments until significant critical mass of ordinary people are also spiritually alive materialistic greedy society will have materialistic corrupt government that will not even wish understand source of unemployment is state unless miracles occur greedy somehow undergo some emergent complexity\u0026quot collectively flock altruism state is cause of all unemployment currency it monopoly issues but is then also sole body that can eliminate all unemployment it created purpose of imposing tax liabilities is drive demand for otherwise worthless currency this creates people seeking earn currency aka unemployed purpose of this is not leave anyone unemployed but hire all workers state just created by imposing tax liabilities residual involuntary unemployment is simple policy mistake tragic one foreign policy perverse homeopathy am not opposed medical homeopathy naturopathy but am against these practices being applied exclusively without scientific backing even as placebo they could be effective treating mild conditions that are partly psychosomatic however foreign policy establishment circles there is something similar that is totally pathological chas freeman said it one line on recent neutrality studies episode my comment @2800 this great one-liner israel has sought security by terrorizing its neighbour its almost universal law of stupidity sort of psychopathic foreign policy perverse homeopathy \u0026mdash yo what hurts our neighbour must be good for them will bring peace by like cures like they just need little more hurt give us some more time yall social media note for anyone who cares know abandoned twitter last year partly because personally had lost woman considered my one true love soul mate so emotionally unable cope much of ordinary life pain has not faded eight months later shows no sign of ever fading they say time heals all wounds but am amassing evidence this is not 100% true but also because no longer consider twitter be ethical platform if it ever it certainly is no longer it is not even clear social aspect of twitter is effective at least not for anyone less than million or so followers so it is not social platform it is he she who gains most celebrity who speaks loudest thats not

clickbait for libertarians case any of them might still stumble across ōhanga pai by one million chance.🤣 rest of us are talking about scorepoints accounts do often worry about real wealth distribution but thing is monetary economy real wealth effects are secondary nominal wealth if you have scorepoints you can get type of real wealth you prefer without scorepoints you will not get real

libertarian fairies leprechauns upon whoa something is wrong spelt leprechauns correct first time pure keyboard hits exchange toy models today few notes that came into my mind from listening dr yonatan berman talking about non-egodicity macroeconomics models he using like reallocating geometric brownian motion seemed little reminiscent of dyi econophysics models they are useful toy models but point playing them is understand what world should not be like not why world is like it is backwards thinking came into ear-shot when berman mentioned his models reallocation parameter $\\tau$ does not capture any specific policy correct statement but then all that means is model is truly toy model unable usefully inform government policy guess thats what you call libertarians realistic model my comment @930 this is important for interpretation right yet because it is not modelled as due policy youve got very unrealistic model for single currency macroeconomy all nations outside emu are currency monopolies state currency is simple public monopoly granted no one power seems know this or if they do they obscure their knowledge but it does give us anyone who does know monetary system operations understanding of how eliminate nominal poverty overnight then your model changes dramatically you can have policy that permits any nominal wealth distribution whatsoever caveat is nation needs be on exchange rate float \u0026mdash which makes all difference because then there is no need for mainstream econ fixed exchange rate mentality which gets interest rate unemployment trade off stories backwards my point being that policy matters it matters enormously far more than any free market economics bro can imagine put none too fine point on it there is no need whatsoever for any involuntary unemployment or nominal poverty nor does government policy eliminate all unemployment nominal poverty risk inflation \u0026mdash risk of inflation would be when on fixed exchange rate on floating exchange rate full employment policy like job guarantee 0% unemployment small transitory fraction risk is fewer imports or need export more pay for imports other words thats domestic

unemployment \u0026mdash waste of human lives needless tragic waste what about using macroeconomic models for public good wrote follow-up am saying your modelling efforts are nice for pedagogy but hope you also can better understand macroeconomics run realistic models that inform wise humane government policy am not naïve idealist thinking governments will take heed neoliberals probably will not but it is moral responsibility serves public purpose at least inform government representatives of better policy options available if they choose anti-worker policies thats on their conscience

email fresh cup of mosler couple of substackers notes on inflation had posted following mmt discussion group recently brian romanchuck dougald lamont blogged bit about inflation lamont here romanchuk here steve keen also had one here what about prices asked mmt group lamont writes about chart showing canada oil price history what it illustrates very clear terms is that inflation of oil prices \u0026mdash which drive consumer inflation \u0026mdash are due conflicts political events question for mmt googlegroup is it fair critique if reply lamont pointing out there is also monopolist opec+ setting price it begs question how influential politics conflict are which direction causality goes major war donbas or middle east can certainly impact supply but monopolist is still price setter right so it is really down how political conflict events disturb leisure of oil monopolist thatd be my challenge for inflationistas is oil monopoly going continue raising price but then are central banks going think they need raise rates fight inflation cough leading sustained inflation regards all fresh shot mosler as is almost typical warren chimed one-liner ive called it duelling monopolies currency monopolist vs oil monopolist ok so maybe not fresh mosler but it fresh for me since had not heard duelling monopolies before context of inflation discussions it is another one of those macroeconomics points that really only mmt expert will comprehend it is highly macro it is recognition source of price level is monopolist if there is no monopolist then something else is governing price level whatever anchor or lack of anchor that may be however mmt historians point is that since dawn of monetary systems records of credits debits held peoples heads or collective memory or clay tablets or these days computer records there has always been currency monopoly you cannot find single currency regions outside of systems of mere bank clearing like banco del giro that are absent currency monopolist whether they know they are source of price level or not is interesting highly relevant question for social equity but operationally there is no denying almost all currencies since

do run on fast computers for those parasitic traders point is we do not need financialization it is obscene parasitic layer completely unnecessary mosler round next day warren followed up another succinct email concerning response nation has foreign monopoly setting oil prices continue duelling monopolies price setters when saudis raise prices our choices include for example allow relative price of oil products that contain oil rise accordingly while all other prices remain same this would be reduction our real terms of trade diminish our real wealth accordingly reverse for saudis its what they would prefer \u0026mdash get more for their oil real terms allow our entire price level shift up accordingly such that real terms of trade remain as before there would be no shift real

whenever necessary according policy option pragmatist would probably suggest few other ways upwards adjust price level transfer payments pensions public servant wage rates for example note that there is no inherent conflict here public servant wages are not competing jg wage nor really are private sector wages once government currency injection goes up jg goes up if people drop out of low paid work choose jg private firms can upwards adjust their compensation workers keep them hired government fiscal injection provides funds for firms make higher sales so their prices can be marked-up too but then theyll have retain employees so this should all have intended effect of one-time upwards adjustment price level this is design intent of policy so private sector employees also get trickle up wage rise if they do not then it is not big deal there is no need for government press private firms increase their wages government protection for workers is job guarantee enforcement of labour standards mmt comprehension here is way understand these matters government from inception first issues currency it functions as tax credit purpose \u0026mdash is that government needs provision public sector but real terms not nominal currency terms explain it this way your friends this way you do not cause moral panic excitations fibre of their whole being when you say taxes bond sales do not finance government spending tax liability not tax receipt creates demand for currency sociologically insatiable demand this allows government hire real resources why because government just created millions of people who want accept currency exchange for their goods or labour there does not even need be any bank existence except scoreboard at one central bank there no tax payers before

negligible even chaotic motion if you cannot measure initial configuration of three stars within millimetre then your puny planets effect will be less than chaotic motion divergence also emphasize point instability predictability are totally different concepts our solar system is both it is for sure unpredictable but might also be unstable however this matters little human space explorers because time over which planetary motions get unpredictable is on order of years or maybe centuries am not exactly sure of typical time period off top of my head not days or years even if our solar system is stable over millions of years no planets will collide or shoot off infinity it is still unpredictable over perhaps thousand year intervals that just means we need lot more data predict where planets will be exactly thousand years compared next year wed need much more than thousand times as much precision data 1960s meteorologist edward lorenz showed same for very simple model of weather

generically quasi-periodic motions far-from-equilibrium but this does not mean economy is unstable it means it is unpredictable there is big difference chaotic systems can of course also be unstable our solar system is thought be unstable though no one can prove it for sure what dynamicist can do is point out our solar system is generically unstable meaning it would be pretty lucky if it stable they can also tell us characteristic time scale for instability time period up until which motions of sun our neighbouring planets is constrained more or less fixed orbits forget number but characteristic period is probably on order of billions of years sun could die out before any of our planets go haywire shoot off interstellar infinity or two planets collide dont quote me on this if you want know then pull up duckduckgo or perplexity ai tab about 17 billion years before any likely major planetary collision hard scifi gripes have no interest critiquing physics of three body but cant help myself you can search youtube for people doing reaction videos three body problem so might be entirely redundant what do care about is being bit of hard scifi snob my attitude is why put fantasy elements into good scifi story if you could instead make it far more interesting heavy realism honest truth is there is far too much physics that gets stretched three body novel than have time or patience critique so im letting it rest except for when there is interesting literary angle comment upon first one worth mentioning is 3bp virtual reality game character von neumann he games isaac newton along main protagonist wang miao convince feudal emperor build human computer 30 million soldiers doing essentially mindless logic gate tasks trouble this plot line is that they appear be building general purpose computer what id have done is construct single purpose 30 million solider machine less prone error faster compute however this is truly pedantic gripe because liu cixin writes correct realist reason 30 million soldier computer fails predict trisolar orbits \u0026mdash namely newtonian dynamics model lacked general relativity corrections knowing this you might ask why classical three body problem this day still attracts some mathematicians cannot tell you why except that mathematicians are fond of torture novels this is attributed psychological acquisition of null religion pseudo-religion among redemptionist faction of eto they begin simply believe as matter of faith that if they solve three body problem trisolarians will leave earth alone by way this fits my definition of religion \u0026mdash which is source of good redemptionists believe their solving 3bp will lead good for all so it is at least pseudo-religion it is also null religion because their solving 3bp is not source of good it is merely source of interesting mathematics which is morally neutral inapplicable real world why are mathematicians so fond of torture why would they work on newtonian mechanics problem that has no real world applications imagine their response would be sure sure general relativity makes three body problem pure art not science but so what mathematics is art happen agree this attitude but you should know it is painful art one never knows when piece will be finished nor whether certain subjective standards of elegance will be met often aesthetics really suck but humble mathematician indulges this tortuous art anyway applied mathematics is very different for here one does seek utility physics or other sciences no one alive today working on newtonian three body problem would be accused of being applied mathematician however if someone ever did figure out efficient algorithm for real-time newtonian dynamics it is possible it might find real world application but because solar system dynamics does require general relativity it would not be application astronomy or space travel or guess it could be used for very short time-scale trajectory computations where effects of general relativity are negligible for normies cannot easily describe why general relativity turns astronomy dynamics into nightmare youll have take it upon authority it does equations for general relativity are so severely difficult compute that exact solutions are known only for truly incredibly symmetric spacetimes they are what less than handful number totally useless for astronomical applications fascinatingly these maximally symmetric solutions are very useful theoretical work because couple of them describe ideal approximations at least two very important real physical phenomena entire cosmos rotating black holes having said that enough computing power general relativistic systems like colliding black holes can be pretty well simulated these days so lesson there is gargantuan enough compute power classical three body problem has about same status as relativistic gravitational problem all of them are hard problems real applications astounding thing is that newtonian three body problem is so damn hard it should be lot easier than typical gr calculation but computational algorithmic terms problems are about same this is typical for chaotic dynamics if system has any non-linearity then computations solve system numerically will be hard theyll all be about as hard as each other for same $n$ bigger $n$ worse exponentially so so extremely frickin harder it gets even more interesting once $n$ becomes truly gargantuan $n$-body problem can be immensely simplified point of solvability \u0026mdash this occurs when there are so many molecules that entire system can be coarsely described on large scale using statistical mechanics statistical mechanics we give up worrying about what any one body is doing entirely we are not interested single body trajectories instead we define macroscopic variables like temperature pressure volume density these fictional variables are then treated as new higher order or emergent variables even if molecular dynamics are highly chaotic macroscopic variable time evolution can under strict conditions be simple solvable class of such solvable statistical mechanics systems are those equilibrium thermal equilibrium this has concern for my macroeconomics political economy allegory macroeconomic system we live within is \u0026mdash luckily${}^\\ddagger$ \u0026mdash not thermal equilibrium any sense this is essentially why neoclassical economics does not work also why perhaps chagrin of some socialists why austrian school economics is not entirely stupid austrians are dummies only because they think gold is currency free markets are possible neither of which is true so end they are as rotten as neoclassicals being half-right field where justice trust matter is as good as being all wrong ${}^\\ddagger$luckily because economic system equilibrium would mean we are all dead or all borg as baby of all hard chaos dynamics problems three body problem has sort of mythic status that is another reason why pure mathematicians might like problem by way trisolarians like humans would have known this well before being capable of interstellar travel how would we know macroeconomic systems are state of equilibrium we would know if macroeconomics could be well-described by small number of dynamical variables analogies temperature volume density \u0026ampc fact our macroeconomic systems taken per country say are far-from-equilibrium systems but also not totally anarchic there are macroscopic observables that can usefully describe time evolution of macroeconomy analogy is like complicated fluid or weather although this is only very weak analogy particular while sun tends monopolize behaviour of our weather governments tend monopolize behaviour of our macroeconomics extend analogy somewhat comically while sun does not know what it is doing us nor do politicians government know what they are doing macroeconomy take this not as argument against government for anarchy but rather argument for better informed educated government if you have something as powerful as sun but exists next door at room temperature has eyes ears email account it could be good idea use it for greater good does that sound like endorsement of authoritarianism you it should not but see why read onwards remembrance of earths past whoa liu cixin is no proust although be fair proust is little over-rated loved reading la recherche du temps perdu when teenager but when matured better understood why monty python skit is even funnier than it first appears proustian romance pathos is one thing but you really cant appreciate it until youve lived good life have experienced true loss of love loss of innocence same for mishimas sea of fertility \u0026mdash even translation it heck of trilogy read masterpiece of japanese literary art all despite yukio mishimas warped politics odd-duck lifestyle sometimes wonder what my life would be like if had been spared all heartache sorrow probably would have been superficially nicer but probably not as meaningful anyhow guess will have something say about politics of hard scifi will use remembrance of earths past trilogy as case study since why not game of thrones is over-cooked by now for scifi fans id recommend epub books you can get them free-libre or look for chinese tv series reading subtitles is not worst thing world my daughters who have smartphone addiction extremely normal average adhd type every kid has these days total normality watch lot of korean sitcom romcom drama guess theyve evolved eyeballs that can flicker sync subtitle display frequency no conscious mental effort music geeks liked some of scores used for choinese tv series that am following parallel reading end credits remind me of theme used donnie darka \u0026mdash mad world by tears for fears written by roland orzabal little touch of genius hate admit my older sister sometimes had good taste pop music premise ill be writing real-time as read novels thus without foreknowledge of plot twists have say did read little about liu cixin opinions about his politics summarize hes little bit apolitical but has this weird view that authoritarianism is natural end state of human civilization think if read reports correctly could be wrong this has offended some scifi fans is remembrance of earths past really chinese state propaganda whoa but like vladimir nabokov dick wouldnt put authors political opinions way of good read for me can easily filter out political propaganda will often laugh at it but merits of scifi story as entertainment could still be considerable anyone remember matrix at worst dumb-dumb politics ruins novel immersive experience so its depressing but rarely get angry fumed up about it no novelist is perfect life is too short write angry letters artists telling them their politics suck will confess then that liked premise of remembrance of earths past one-liner physics does not exist never will exist is pretty good why it is because you should have researched author know he is computer engineer thus you know damn well he better have very good plot for how heck physics cannot exist addition early english book translation story notes what essence of physics is for us which is patterns of invariant structures or symmetries put it more elegantly physics is nothing if not study of most basic elementary symmetry principles that hold within our universe newtons laws electromagnetism einsteins gravity quantum mechanics \u0026mdash all can be written terms of fundamental symmetry principles governing interaction of matter spacetime hence liu cixin knows this for physics not exist would mean symmetries physicists have discovered are illusory this opens up panoply of something like matrix universe one that is programmed at whim of universal programmer wolfram physics ya nerds cannot tell if that is where liu cixin takes story but he has opened up wide field for plot nice master-stroke probably not chinese state propaganda just sayin' having not yet gotten crux of three body problem have insert my own bit of politics harder scifi reckon you can take remembrance of earths past as poetic allegory am damn sure this is not what liu cixin thinking but im telling you this is one way can absorb whole idea looming three body problem which metaphors then well you can say capitalism does not exist never will exist but thats almost too comical or is it way think of marxist counter capitalism is as bit of fantasy neither capitalists nor marxists are theorising about reality as far as can tell their economics does not exist so id get my proper poetic analogy via economics does not exist as allegory id take this mean our economy surely exists as does matter spacetime probably remembrance of earths past not yet sure problem is that what economists think economics is is totally unreal thatd be my poetic take on three body problem story only trouble is this is good thing whereas three body problem it is supposedly getting teed up as bad thing physics does not exist is some sort of incipient war on science or intellectuals story macroeconomics it is damn good thing marxists neoclassicals preach bogus economics because no one should ever be forced live their gold is currency capitalism is revolutionary fantasy universe disclosure used think capitalism is revolutionary force fair enough theory but better grasp of neoliberalism has disabused me of this childish reading of marxism neoliberal capitalism has potential persist on state life-support forever f-o-r-e-v-e-r how ubi ya sockcuckers revolutionary force if there ever is be one has be spiritual capacity of people working together overthrow tyranny injustice this is not capitalism by any definition this is at least nice way enjoy scifi story because am unable enjoy it much as physicist myself it is too fantastical so not good enough hard scifi cannot tolerate fantasy literature for long periods short stories some sort of allegorical moral fable are ok but immersive fantasy literature stuff is me like reading superhero comics complete waste of my time when kid like commodore 64 video games know adults indulge these forms of entertainment million people watch reality tv shows just dont understand it \u0026mdash who has that amount of free time or what heck is wrong me that dont have such free time reason matrix cool because you could read it as allegory for materialistic society even if wachowskis did not intend for this be poetic reading who has you trapped real matrix you do you your ego insatiable desires for material wealth comforts agent smith all said done human invention extract yourself from real matrix you want recognize what truly matters your life thatd be love kindness waking up from real matrix means becoming more spiritual person macroeconomics political economy allegory agent smith is something like white supremacist or neocon or christian fascist theyre not entirely disjoint categories his religion is rule of machines or not even that it is rule by agent smith beyond fascism nation is sacred total monarchy king is sacred always shed tear for my friends thailand at such points my thought one nation within which sizeable proportion of citizens still has very unhealthy regard for their monarch this leads extension of my allegory humanity our times is fact gripped by tentacles of insidious sort of vague ideology id call it neoliberalism but it goes beyond narrow meaning of that word it extends whole plethora of null doctrines economics macroeconomics sociology politics that tells us human beings are mere animals incapable of peace idea is we have be competitive${}^\\dagger$ this is how we survive we have dominate others moreover this is bred into us our dna so forth will not belabour whole blackpill nihilist thesis there are too many varieties im just sketching cartoon of idea however do mean refer real world ${}^\\dagger$or more extreme idea we do not have any choice matter since we have no free will idiocy of sam harris robert sapolsky their like first define free will for me bros it is pervasive ideology infecting popular culture social discourse everywhere it is ruinous for chances of decent civilization however unlike nihilists believe humanity has collective capacity overcome this narrow dystopian world view call me optimist hopeless romantic but it is what believe is possible just dont ask me offer any probabilities id say 100% but have no clue what time-frame would be asymptotics is easy real-time dynamics is hard-to-impossible but this is also not topic of this article today farmer shooter hypotheses maybe should not waste space expanding on turkey flat worlder metaphors think better point make is how this sets up null dichotomy three body story viewpoint reader is supposedly drawn is this binary option either we are like turkeys thinking dawn brings food every day oblivious of catastrophe of thanks giving or we are flat worlders oblivious some 3d entity is toying our world as if we ants meaning pretty oblivious of our cares desires whether you go all nihilist pomo or nietzsche response may indicate some political persuasion but think am optimist talking about our real world now because believe most ordinary people are capable of more enlightened world view one where human beings might seem insignificant but that we are nonetheless amazing creatures as are any other alien civilizations our universe who are sentient have developed science technology big lie is that sentience is total accident we might not be turkeys nor flat worlders at any primitive time human history maybe it seems that way but thats individualistic attitude whereas can both appreciate worth of every individual creature imagine collectively life is something special there is also point nihilists should consider which is that even if life not special it might become special my political economy allegory neoliberalism is probably transitory abomination mean why would you suppose we are accidents of course know why maintain physics philosophy blog where write more about such topics but short version would be we just cannot truly know yet we could very likely be remarkable species being small universe does not equate insignificance isnt it very male fallacy consider size be of any importance hence most likely dead wrong size mass are important for many things of course but get too massive you eventually become useless sucky black hole when size is not important is of most importance spiritual realm size has completely different meaning anything physical abstract being spiritual giant connotes great wisdom compassion physical world where spiritual beings subsist this sort of size truly does matter always think of output from mathematics science be inexorable companions of spiritual maturation another thing worth mentioning \u0026mdash eco-extremists ive never found extreme animal rights eco-extremist people be very spiritual they like three body character dr ye weinjie even more extreme mike evans pan han characters have jaundiced view of humanity lump them rightly or wrongly same category as agent smith matrix itd be sad if liu cixin among them is he half-way through book it looks possible ye wenjie will turn more compassion for humanity guess it is nice for my depression that am immersed enough book care for her character also wonder which character is liu cixin identifying as author not that we need care but is it ye wenjie or wang maio \u0026mdash or trisolarian thatd be funny it is starting become that sort of story where care about authors views which is bad sign sign of poor writer if it goes all full authoritarian big daddy mode on us doubt ill get 2nd 3rd books having mums dads is great but it does not scale am pretty much now locked-in against solution by authoritarian rule even if it frickin worked plot problem is really about how individuals bitter experience can lead them think of all of humanity as evil irredeemable its incredibly childish self-centred attitude truth is think most people are like this we can save animals save biosphere also love humanity these are not contradictory or mutually exclusive options think otherwise is imbecilic rotten apple fallacy id go further human species is not cancer or plague we are natural outcome of life on earth so maybe have little compassion for us too as well as swallows by this account you have no reason think am correct but ill state it anyway greater people are spiritually greater will be their science greater will be many of their aspects greater both abstract spiritual material advancement awesomeness moreover such wise tiny insignificant creature on mundane living planet might reach out stars it will not be long grand scheme of things before humans do reach stars by then insignificance of any one human might suppose might still be regarded by fools as cause think our lives have no cosmic importance but more sagacious wise it can be true one puny life has lot of meaning by virtue of its tiny insignificant contribution whole as keep trying remind some tentatively nihilist mmt friends who give up on elections for government no one vote seems count but fact they all do that is power of summation addition is powerful thing subtraction is also powerful thing once you get zero you are dead when people withhold their vote elections they are ceding power those who do vote so it is disgusting defeatism using your vote register protest means voting for someone or something not abstaining unless result of mass abstinence is some good abstain from voting when there is only one horrible choice but if you abstain it seems morally incumbent upon you exert great effort create better system where your vote is worthwhile is it not say give up on political parties \u0026mdash they are anathema for decent society but do not give up your vote do not rely solely upon collective power of vote either all means available for peaceful revolution need be employed excellent dialogue about half way three body problem protagonist wang miao asks venerable gentle dr ye wenjie about physics does not exist she answers that it is not that physics does not exist but that what we think is physics is wrong im not sure of spin netflix adaptation will have on this nor am sure how this remark will play out original novels but it is crux for me at least worth writing about my allegorical interpretation too ye wenjie likens scientists now church of old who thought copernicus as guilty of heresy bruno dascoli worth stake galileo worth spanish inquisition she says maybe we are like church meaning respect todays scientific apostates it is lot less dramatic for physics these days though than it is for political economy since physics base marble is pretty close contact us now though particle accelerators cosmology quantum computing of course very base level since qcs are exploiting entanglement entanglement is base marble of our universe perhaps it is no accident schrödingers cat gets mention immediately preceding scene detective shi qiang we are nowhere near base marble of economics but mmt is part of base huge gap remains orthodox even mmt-inspired political economy that is spiritual realm ive not encountered any professional economists who even dare acknowledge this yet \u0026mdash maybe there are few like kate raworth or jason hickel but do not really know for sure are they merely acting ethically because they think it good for themselves or do they realize spiritual principles are at very heart of true economics not just ecological principles but spiritual principles suspect they do not acknowledge they place ecology ahead as primary but this is grave mistake because we cannot have sound ecosystem by just asserting ecology is important spiritual prerequisites are needed even if only at bare minimum level of political recognition that ecological economics importance is something worth caring about if your economists do not care about ecology then nothing wil be done politically ecological economics academics can scream their heads off it will only be when people dying is clear consequence of ignorance of ecology that politicians will lift finger dial ecologists invite them table too late but it doesnt have play out that way if people can learn spiritual principles are more important even than ecology then there is hope of avoiding catastrophe know it is hard ask for realist even harder for dumb-dumb materialist but youve got ask at this point through reading 3bp am certainly worried for my entertainment pleasure that liu cixin might head towards blackpill nihilism hope thats not case getting immersed into story is wonderful form of entertainment but if bubble is shattered its kinda depressing which defeats purpose interestingly although am not close friends warren mosler only friendly acquaintance think he has moral component his work over decades on what became mmt he has always said he talks anyone power or schools or general public who is listening out of sense of public duty moral obligation few other economists teach from this motive they teach from textbooks for paycheck academic career they have no idea at least 25% of what they teach is nonsense fact unethical if you know this what are you teaching for never teach for paycheck expect paycheck but dont let that be reason you teach ok do not personally know lot of economics teachers im just guessing but prove me wrong can it be that they are not teaching economics for pay check yet refuse inquire into fundamental truths of subject what do know is that mosler at least does not do it for any income he is pure but of course considered crank heretic by mainstream economists of all persuasions post-keynesians marxists new keynesians neoclassical alike warren mosler is copernicus of our times it is lucky stephanie kelton has not yet been burned at metaphorical stake you could say steve keen one burned at stake but like youd expect for aussie he survived ordeal only increased his cuss word

no reason become nihilistic humans do good things bad things we do not have solve three body problem for redemption we only need treat each other kindness forgiveness but other side justice is not allow people who wish do harm harm others other words becoming more spiritual person is process one that cannot be perfected but which can be acquired ever greater measure one measure is not sit idly

parallel reading novels tv series you see these little red ants from time time heavy cinematic significance are trisolarans red ant things you know think they are or maybe not mcguffin have say of tv adaptation world central command gang are freakin bad actors it is pretty hilarious oh yeah chinese state propaganda can believe it this case on this issue ive watched plenty of action movies superhero marvel batman superman stuff my life know state propaganda is pervasive relative half time hollywood probably does not know it is doing propaganda its like noam chomsky used say you do not have believe you are propagandists be doing propaganda more likely youre self-selected only natural born establishment shills get promoted high rank mainstream media still kind of preferred 1960s era depictions three body modern china is incredible country bustling dynamism pollution it comes it is super modern but there is no excuse for shoddy acting when depicting international governmental crowd whats all military regalia hilarious stuff seriously dude honestly think it is for comic effect could it not be guess it might not be so then it is even more hilarious spoils scifi entertainment aspect though pity im not sure this can be made critique of liu cixins literary style but fact there are some plot points dialogues albeit english translation that seem pretty cringe skip over that speed-reading if can but much same dune expanse novels you have know when speed read when slow down enjoy sub-genius literature its like movies suspension of disbelief only literature dont know analogous phrase it should not be thing but lot of scifi literature it is sadly there is lot of other funny stuff tv adaptation that makes it bit too hilarious get immersed not as serious scifi too many bother mentioning use of stock footage lot of characters stereotyped then symbol of eto \u0026mdash clear upside down freemason symbol whats that about romantic cinematic scenes started get bit trite too although like slowish pace they introduce im only watching reading along because im very depressed at moment been hard few weeks on top of hard few months on top of hard five years after five years of bitter-sweet bliss that got surgically removed from my heart thousand blunt chainsaws technicomedies 2017 tv series is funnier than books of course chinese state propaganda no seriously it is funny liked way they depicted ye wenjies discovery of radiation boundaries inside sun these are regions where frequencies of emission sharply drop in-between boundaries fall off frequency is gradual power law presumably there are fact boundary layers sun stars but believe they are more like conventional magnetohydrodynamic boundaries three body problem liu cixin has invent nice little fantasy physics into story get million-fold magnification of microwave transmissions he needs but it is cool soft scifi plot device japprouve comedy angle is tv series depicts ye wenjies thesis as stair case profile of frequencies they should have used power law fall off boundary zones instead just for cool factor but ya know comedy is only for learned although itd be nice little sociological experiment survey how many ordinary tv watchers realized staircase profile bit fishy school teachers take note try it on your students come think of it this is really serious good of shows like three body they make some excellent school teaching resources for discussion from bitter experience ive learned physics of scifi lessons are not good schools that have national standards examination focus but for younger older kids 50 years or under 12 years these fantasy resources make nice motivation for informal discussion college dorm room banter suspended judgment theres little point ruining fantasy scifi story realist gripes however can make exception when you put characters actors entertainment jeopardy \u0026mdash by which mean painting them histrionically it ruins pure entertainment experience at least for us hard scifi art snobs this is what liu cixin seemed have contrive here is what mean imagine scenario of begin confronted outright miracles thing presented only few top scientists what would be their response it would not be commit suicide did liu cixin really need make story about physicist suicides it think that unnecessary for plot most physicists know would be intrigued first would look counsel one another check not everyone going insane science just is not done such isolation as portrayed three body problem it did not have be written that way crisis could have been instead sheer confusion among physicists itd be far more natural that physicists would get together there is frontier of science group story who are bit mystical \u0026mdash think that will be integral plot later probably aliens but more sedate investigative world committee of physicists exploring miracles would have been equally as compelling story more interesting more realistic note netflix version might be different do not know do not yet know if story is about alien first contact just third of way but red coast base satellite must surely become first contact instrument liu cixin did get it right mostly though where it mattered because he had one anti-hero wang miao respond miracles realistically that incredibly important for me stick book wang miao realized miracle of countdown subjective that means laws of physics are not really vamoosed it allowed character find empathy friendship desultory roughish but ultimately loveable detective shi qiang yes response of realistic community of physicists would our real world been more like wang maios response but then guess few plot turns three body problem might not be available too bad say eliminate them make story more believable it would be better work of art as it stands remembrance of earths past is probably scifi classic but not reaching level of literary epic will probably still finish trilogy stay tuned then for more on 3bp allegory real gripe have here is very general critique of all literature movies when it comes heros if you have single character as hero or anti-hero your story is am afraid say not realistic but there is no need write novel this way main central protagonist heroine hero same trope ruined expanse \u0026mdash although loved those books too me just subjectively they epic although not great literature does iain banks write from more humanistic perspective ursula leguin if they have ive not heard enough about their novels hey can only spare time read about one scifi

chinese tv adaptation it depicts our solar system living within larger cosmos as if our entire universe sitting inside tip of piece of carbon nanotube similar concept is put more comedic purposes ending sequence of men black if recall bona fide real physics concept here is called conformal or scale invariance it is idea that our laws of physics are not sensitive overall scale of things so we could magnify everything up by googol-fold no one should notice difference it is approximate symmetry some areas of physics notably electromagnetism some string theory models it also is symmetry that probably holds for time scales our universe close our so-called big bang fact some cosmologists \u0026mdash notably neil turok latham boyle \u0026mdash believe can show their math that whole lot of particle physics makes whole lot more sense if our universe had exact conformal symmetry at big bang if it did then there is little need explain where big bang came from since supposed singularity at our conformal time $\\tau=0$ would not truly exist itd be reflection symmetry boundary 4d block universe conception of nature this says that nothing came before big bang origin of our universe is then something more global whatever put us all here put whole 4d thing here all at once so-to-speak or at least implicitly since nothing exists on other side of mirror nothing exists on other side of our big bang some people like think there is actual mirror universe on other side \u0026mdash but reflection reflects it does not transmit just sayin if you prefer cosmology where universe does exist through conformal symmetry boundary then roger penrose has conformal cyclic cosmology for you work on but it is by far harder physics get right is probably wrong there is however hybrid of turok\u0026ndashboyle penrose due anthony lasenby colleagues which is that far future conformal symmetry could possibly be lived through for elementary particles not biological life but universe on other side would be time reflected respect ours thats wild one wrap your head around but follow math it is not illogical nor inconceivable since this is not my physics blog think will leave this topic here cannot quite turn it useful allegory redemptionists versus adventists spoilers ok it is about alien first contact oh no no no story got too stupid for me factions loyal lord advanced alien civilization start doing whole anti-religious thing meaning pseudo-religious zealot ideological thing thought id make it through end of three body problem but it has become too cringe however there is something be recovered my allegory it is true that mmt circles there are factions some mmt advocates are capitalists some socialist mix in-between guess some might be quasi-libertarians there are plenty of liberals however do not see three body problem being of more use for my allegory using scifi as allegory nice game worth paying while it lasted today still do not think book is chinese state propaganda but tv series has enough weird actors playing international community they appear be amateur actors that it sort of ruins feel of tv series cinematography is good for tv streaming budget but got bit tired sucking cringe on many aspects of production eventually am guessing netflix version will be cringe another way way game of thrones became but ill have look at it next year maybe just case they do something different whole aliens as lord plot change that up into something realistic more hard scifi it could be very good entertainment conflict theory ok im being too sensitive for sure history teaches us humans tend get into ideological conflict when there is uncertainty so it is not at all unrealistic that eto three body would splinter into factions this fits plenty of allegories as just mentioned will suck-it-up then continue reading later on will get spoiler where cixin liu paints trisolarians motives for wanting invade earth but have not read up it yet book however do like my scifi more when super-powerful aliens are ethical why would they not be worst dis-analogy people have about this is getting reflected contemporary society form of fear of ai superintelligence idea is supertintelligent ai might treat human species as ants this is laughable it is idea based on null analogy analogy is how humans treat actual ants there are many flaws analogy but biggest is that superintelligence will conform our pretend analogies another is idea hierarchies of intelligence will recapitulate fractal sociology notion there is no justification for this thesis fact am pretty cynical about ai tech industry think they are capable even innocently of drumming up fear of ai singularity just fuel their research call it nerd capitalism but heck better fund nerds than military say although youd like fund einsteins not oppenheimers tellers not all nerds compiled equal thing about nick bostrom connor whatshisname whatshisname yudkowsky whatshisname hinton \u0026mdash all ai singularity fear-mongers \u0026mdash is that their inferences are bogus but why can prove they are wrong no cannot prove they are wrong we just cannot well-predict future problem here is one of probability theory ai nerds want you believe their doom prognostications are 95% confident bands or whatever truth is they have no idea what error bands are for their doom predictions nightmare scenarios no one does if pressed on this some of them will say yeah but prepare for worst ok what is worst case scenario though once again they have no idea they have worst case nightmares dreams but so do mine are not same as theirs who is say whose nightmares are more realistic our biggest closest threat coming from ai is powerful wealthy people seeking monopolize technology not robots themselves whats more all null psychology macroeconomics \u0026mdash it is equally threat human well-being robot automation does not take away worker wages they take away shit jobs any useful work ai bot can do is by definition shit job this does not mean quality control oversight of ai systems \u0026mdash for those are shit jobs that must always be human workers burden those people need decent wages but even more importantly such workers need good healthcare ai system has have such costs factored if that makes them unprofitable it is then up government worry about whether ai service is socially necessary therefore needs be subsidized or nationalized primarily question for ai automation is is it actually reducing human labour burdens overall increasing human well-being such questions can be hard answer we might get them wrong sometimes but they are not impossible estimate we have do so every shit job removed from human workers daily burden without introducing more shit jobs or pollution elsewhere is win for humanity only mmt aware know this means more cash for worker wages is affordable without inflation risk why because we aught be commissioning ai robots produce real output for human other planetary needs that means all humans can work fewer hours producing that output but this also means people can work for higher wages doing more interesting things like producing awesome scifi novels or curing cancer interesting thing is if we all content live humbly we would have zero need for ai humanity survived for centuries without robots but if we collectively desire ever higher standards of living necessary healthcare support is going consume vast resources then we will probably need lot more automation my claim would be what we fundamentally have deal politically globally is ethical macroeconomics spiritual economics fair go for all people it has nothing do ai ai can be used as tool emancipate working class but it is only tool this means dismantling old power structures replacing them power authority that serves interests of poorest for poor did not get vote determining their condition spoiler trisolarian need for invasion gawd it bit disappointing trisolarian militarists are scared of humans they realize human science advances at faster pace than trisolarian ok it is good enough plot device they also have not figured out magneto brain helmets shield their thoughts we will assume humans could figure out how hud display trisolarians brain beamed thought lol dunno though am going cold on whole trilogy why do aliens always need be threat its xenophobic it is also disgusting given actual border humanitarian crises on our actual earth heart yearns for cool scifi novel without xenophobia as default contact reaction expanse such cool series placing human conflict where it truly is for real its class conflict it always has been racism is fairly new human invention some say though am no expert on this lot of racism invented fuel capitalism liberal meaning of word capitalism \u0026mdash includes slavery of all forms including tying pencil pushers paper shufflers desks even when theyre not complaining about it look-up bullsh$\\ast$t jobs nihilism do get strong theme of nihilism three body humans suck but it is prejudice of our times it is jaundiced view of humanity that originates from looking only at evil people do ignoring all good be wise one needs weight such extremes although im no anthropologist would suspect if we weight acts people do have done overall human species is truly marvellous wonderful it is however fair enough plot device use because few cynics can certainly spoil things for millions ill thus be interested reading on see where liu cixin takes this but it could get boring tell us more about liu cixins blinkered view of humanity than about what he could have learned from life reflected his scifi art redemptionists or anti-puniness man oh man redemptionists story get terrible treatment avoiding spoilers here want comment on bit of modern fable that liu cixin draws upon for his plot it is idea that humans are puny insignificant un-special actually find this laughable but understandable so also crux ill try explain firstly capacity we have see ourselves as either special or insignificant is pretty significant its not paradox since out is clearly that we are special any creature that gains sentient subjective consciousness knows it is special it is ignorance of physics fail see this people who think humans are just highly evolved apes are missing everything or shall be fair say they are missing nearly everything secondly take copernican principle seriously this is idea that its not good idea think you are centre of universe clearly humans are not centres of universe however this does not logically lead conclusion we are insignificant it just means we are not centre of course centre here means be all end all as well as scientific notion that cosmos does not have privileged status for any one observer or plant it is key principle of modern science as explained before its about symmetry principles invariants these are what define physics but again this refutes nihilist thesis because very fact human civilization has proven capable of discovering principles of physics so much more at higher levels of organization implies again we are highly significant creatures dont write us off you mad adventists dont want write essay on this so ill mention just third fourth point for now can think of many more third is simplistic idea universe is so damn vast earth is so damn small so we literally are insignificant this is most laughable it does not even bare mention but feel must mention it for some weaker minds point is ruler clock scale is not great metric for significance there is no telling what human civilization will become capable of so concluding right now that we are puny insignificant is pretty insane lastly fourth you should consider that humans on earth might fact advance future something like fictional trisolarian technical advancement wed be lords perhaps some other backwards planetary civilization this despite not having harshness of trisolaris cut our technological teeth upon \u0026mdash thats fantastical plot device be sure \u0026mdash ultracapitalism or ultradarwinism there is more say on this fourth principle of non-significance it has relevance current debates about ai singularity idea is wed better be careful developing ai because it might over-run us treat humans like we treat ants this is laughable it is null inference terribly childish dis-analogy for one thing humans do not have go around treading on ants digging up insects no concern or compassion we mess earth knowing insects are likely not conscious whereas hypothetical trisolarian civilization would damn well for sure know humans sentient would you believe advanced alien race would treat humans like ants no theyd treat us like humans what that means is impossible for us say because we have nothing relevant infer from except how we treat each other again how we treat each other could be cause for touch of nihilism but hardly ive never been treated anything but kindly indifferent by every person on earth have ever met sockcuckers all hiding online actually victim of crime couple of times but did not know it at time ok case closed guess all humans suck are irredeemable \u0026lsquocos ya know if one person can be criminal well hell cleetus we all are capable dognabit send us all hell cleetus be quick about it thanks know its only story by so disappointing gentle scientist ye wenjie goes all cleetus dad on all of humanity faaarrrk continuing ignoring it is only story idea humans are ants as trisolarians are humans is null analogy it applies only some intellectual sense not spiritual sense certainly not political or colonialist imperialist sense ants do not have any politics have no companions they love are willing die for they just die for their colony by instinct their sociology is also blind instinctual we talk about ant society by imposing our language on situation but it is very different category human society any analogies here are highly fraught ample scope for error stupid reasoning lobster hierarchy this topic is probably worth essay for idiot philosophers if had nothing better do but do so no essay why is this making three body problem sucky story it is because even though it is only story authorial god for good scifi story cannot use null analogies characters can authors not oh damn cannot resist fifth another source of nihilism feelings of insignificance is individualistic mindset sure my friend you might be insignificant but human civilization need not be so but would go further but only because have few other metaphysical suspensions did mean write suspicions am one of those who think consciousness indicates we are not physical creatures but we live physical world if you can put those two thoughts together constructive way then you will get idea wont need elaborate any case it is most powerful sort of evidence that we are not insignificant puny creatures but rather some sense cosmos made for us any other sentient civilizations being dropped into such vast cosmos is of course humbling but think that is entirely part of point of it if only you can understand puniness is contextual you hopefully can see where am going my macroeconomics political economy allegory we cannot say past understanding of neoclassical macroeconomics means doom for socialism or decent society we would need know what advanced level of political comprehension will do for humanity you never know 15 or 20 years we might be doing wonders or maybe itll take great catastrophe so century or more outlook any case we today cannot comprehend how political economy will evolve there is thus no cause for doom gloom there is incredible cause for fear regret but not for doom gloom fact does it not imply eternal optimist is preferred stance wiser stance think so doom gloom are fact neoclassical attitudes themselves stuck-in-a-rut attitudes no capacity think dynamically there is big irony there since arent neoclassicals big boosters of dynamo of capitalism listen you guys dynamo that can only swirl about equilibrium is no creative thing you shouldnt want neoclassical economics even if it true authorial insertion about two-third way through first book find myself caring about author now which is bad sign for enjoying story dont want story going down paternal alien overlord route not only is it sucky scifi it starts seem like betraying authors motives spoiler it is quite audacious piece of writing have main character ye wenjie push button on microwave transmitter send message of come please rule over us just after reading first ever alien contact message please do not communicate im pacifist among my people we will invade you please do not communicate cixin tries motivate this via alienation among humans loneliness of ye wenjie but find that character sketch unbelievable real life ye wenjie would probably not betray entire human race like that plot seems far more symptomatic of liu cixins pessimism than of good well written story know im only reading translation but still also know it is pointless critiquing fiction but cant help myself call it post twitter withdrawal syndrome yeah gave up that gaping hole of enshittification let me emphasize it is not bad scifi fantasy read it gives me this grist write just wish it not so cringe ill tell you one of arts of genius writing you dont need terrific vocabulary nor amazing descriptive prowess but you do need sympathy for your reader unless you are james joyce \u0026mdash genius by entirely other means such galaxy brained genius cant get through one of his books id rather spend time reading mathematical physics crud of advanced aliens its same trouble superheros if you do not build-in flaws fallibility then your advanced alien species that regards humans as puny insects is unbelievable story lower than soft scifi it becomes just fantasy novel have no time for reading fantasy novels but also have no time write this blog post either amazing what you can do stealing time spaghetti trisolarians have no need invade earth theyd be spiritual species write story as if they want wipe out humanity because them we are insects is thoroughly unbelievable it seriously gives me urge quit reading book its liu cixin now who needs redeem himself hate it when books turn this way onto authors view but this case it is so bad \u0026lsquocos wanted it be harder scifi so what am gonna do know know should not want so much such superpower stories lean on fallacy mentioned previously namely that social hierarchy scales sentient species hierarchy wrong so badly wrong it cannot scale once civilization is at human level of advancement it is capable of regarding recognizing other intelligent species as worthy of giving care it is not even that it is irrational not assume higher species would recognize lesser sentient species but that spiritual faculty we know we all have would be somehow less advanced powerful alien species why would that be so far more realistic case would be opposite theyd be more peaceful spiritual than us not less by long way pre-22nd century scifi writers are not getting this mean whole dystopian thing space war thing is terrible prejudice of our times star wars is literally childrens entertainment fodder yeah loved star wars as kid it our generations matrix but grown-up can be little more mature learn respect more serious scifi space opera which is incredibly rare so all more delicious when found even red mars series by kim stanley robinson bit too militaristic for my taste ok it clearly allegory cautionary tale but it still could have been more spiritual write of future spiritual way is tough get that but wish more scifi authors would try it is greater art write tension intrigue without prepubescent man-baby militarism but lets face it humanity is at adolescent stage history so most people cannot see what adult futuristic scifi could be if wrote novel of this kind it would likely flop mean even if genius writer maybe ursula leguin wrote few of kind would admire but so far ive only read couple of her books they seemed me have bit of humans are stupid war is inevitable vibe them too two proton theory spoiler fun stuff blogging about scifi real-time how are trisolarians using two protons shut down human science am guessing itll be entanglement so quantum teleportation its soft scifi because you cannot exploit teleportation without first going other end of your entangled system at conventional sub-luminal speed guess 7-dimensional string theory space calabi-yau manifold will come into play too but cannot see how that swings plot permit disruption of human science over 400 years trouble is for physicist this is enough of carrot keep you reading bad novel spoilers ok read through where sophons are explained superstring theory it is protons being unfolded so that one of calabi-yau compactified dimensions becomes macroscopic it disappointing that this plot device used then etch computer logic arrays onto enlarged dimension turning single proton into supercomputer once calibi-yau dimension is enlarged there is nothing but vacuum write or etch upon if you engineer some other actual membrane write information on then it will no longer be proton by definition particular it could not then be recompressed back down small superstring dimensions besides which proton is not compactified object it is composite of strings three constantly mixing quarks ephemeral sea of gluons \u0026mdash these far more unstable critters are all you could unpack into large extra dimensions so this highly cringe for reading physicist wanting some decent entertainment there have be dozens of better ways scifi imagine stealth supercomputer carrying ai program as weapon against earth would probably go for nanobots that can assemble mimic natural biological species like ant processing could be done partly remote using entangled bell pairs all ant would need do would be receive radio signals for quantum teleportation decoding quantum teleport is not possible at faster-than-light speed receiver needs be sent instruction via normal space channels having such realistic constraints is good for scifi writer though admit fantacists these would be nowhere near as cool as liu cixins sophons sophon is incredibly scary scifi invention one of my favourite horrors now if we are talking pure fantasy can appreciate good fantasy just do not like it inserted into scifi am not so sure about trisolarians having brains that emit electromagnetic waves that betray all their thoughts so they cannot lie or deceive that one came as shock am sure liu cixin thought he needs it for novelty or some plot turn but again it is too big stretch for scifi why not stick magneto erik lehnsherr helmet on shield your thinking you cannot write serious scifi tell me no trisolarian would think of this nor that their evolution would not have had go through period where their brains not so luminous as said cringe worrisome since as goes scifi cringe so probably goes sociology political cringe cannot see second novel dark forest going well for reader like myself however did like way detective shi qiang ended first novel not horrific nano flying knife slicing of oil tanker but bugs bit some hope for optimistic reader reading scifi for imagination creative reflection upon our future amidst too much stupid nihilism but you know im going be nerd about it bugs speech is pure bullshit motivation zero reality why because of biological scaling laws bugs can survive outwit humans because we are truly intent on eliminating them entirely smaller means faster breeding vaster numbers superior robustness so analogy of bugs humans as humans trisolarians does not hold it does not scale larger metabolism organism easier it is extinct species it interesting cixin wrote character ye wenjie as one who thought advanced aliens would almost surely have be spiritual kind compassionate peaceful afterword it seems clear liu cixin himself thinks opposite so he has terrible sense of social consciousness feel what dick hey my informed opinion is all he should not have written afterword it ruined whole reading experience author sometimes needs stfu same problem frank herbert good example of author who stays quiet better would be william gibson dont quite know why but for me subjectively it should be same problem for ursula leguin but dont always get same cringe from her books im not saying authors cannot have afterwords for their novels am just saying unfortunate bother reading this one however it is not all bad liu cixin seems be sympathetic environmentalism greater unity among people of earth his atrocious political beliefs are concerning non-existent aliens not that think extraterrestrials do not exist think they do but it is childish believe mathers theory fictional rand author character that theyd be hostile or would be source of conflict among humans simply by symbolic event of first contact or monopolization of knowledge potentially gained from advanced alien species kind of makes you hope other guys had star trek prime directive there is more balanced view of ceti communication extraterrestiral intelligence cold war context you can get here mixed signals communication alien cold war radio astronomy by rebecca charbonneau she actually discusses three body problem did not read it all since it is irrelevant now cold war is over her thesis mostly concerned historical analysis of cold war politics not future et contact suspect some of fictional bill mather theory might be applicable should et contact just one person or nation tomorrow why would they ok liu cixin portrays scenario why they might thats fun of scifi also who knows maybe liu cixin influenced by some rand lunatic lot of stuff that came out of rand laughable neocon foolery unfortunately cloaked lot of serious intent taken seriously by neoliberals it seems by liu cixin rand also had plenty of intellectual firepower lend air of distinguished scholarship lot of what came out of rand also very good analysis but if you are reader of rand reports user it is your duty conduct due diligence weed out wheat from chaff fans of liu cixin should not be upset flame me these are just my personal opinions so dont hate me for them am not saying he wrote chinese state propaganda material critical non-criticism have repeatedly stated at least four times now think that am not really interested too much literary criticism story is what it is fact if came across blog like this without context would also be pretty disgusted myself \u0026mdash it is not my place criticize liu cixins story-telling as said merely found need read novel get over bout of depression since three body problem became incredibly annoying felt had release some frustrations have tried next best thing which is use 3bp as allegory for my macroeconomic justice activism chance indulge bit of sociological futurology think might continue as go through 2nd 3rd books of trilogy as my mood takes me also will admit this blog post is not for my readers it is just for me if you are enjoying it so far thats bonus had finished first novel by end of next section have decided keep reading 2nd but will not promise more commentary there is slim chance trilogy will become more hopeful by which mean more realistic this probably runs counter cultural milieu contemporary society where climate change pollution endless wars have become source of deep cynicism nihilism dont bring baby into this world but simply dont share such hopelessness if for no other reason than hopelessness does our more optimistic scenario chances no good also my particular babies now young adults are going do lot more good for our society than ever can preliminary \u0026mdash 90% through think expanse is 2020s best scifi on small screen so far often stray my thoughts think about why it not because it militaristic nor great literature answer for me is that expanse had heroes heroines collective insanity martian faction but overall it portrayed humans as decent united when they realized they needed be including most martians it this good but also it detective story which stayed true genre end scifi essentially or at least subjectively me mcguffin of expanse greatest mcguffin ive ever witnessed so far tolerated few others there starz series counterpart based around parallel world tunnel german production dark nuclear power station mishap turned time travel portal german series based around fictional town of winden they watchable today am having more fun writing this article than reading novel so another red flag my old age ive learned dismiss time travel stories they dont work for me unless used for comedy parallel worlds are no good either but thats bias have from my own physics research preferences so if anyone thinks there is scifi entertainment better than expanse please tell me good stuff is good for me when am low depressed will probably persist remembrance of earths past but now think its going be more chore than for entertainment curiosity can do that kills catch yang dong did make it end of three body damn spoilers diabolical is not even harshest word what happened yang dong piece of scifi writing be sure that id never really read before will relate story case you do not like reading epic tragedy so ye wenjie contacts aliens using sun as million-fold amplifier asks them invade earth her motive is unifying humanity she may yet get her wish since humans can unify all right face of common enemy she recognizes she betrayed all humankind worse come mike evans eco-extremist co-opts ye wenjies ideals monopolizes contact trisolarians he plans destroy human species entirely no jokes totally serious his adventist faction of eto has this as their explicit goal ye wenjie has redemptionist sympathy those who worship trisolarians as potential benevolent overlords whole kettle of fishy fish wont get into but you probably know my views by now trisolarians can only send radio message or couple of protons earth they do so takes only 40 years protons arrive by around 2020 they have been crafted store advanced ai using unfolded calabi-yau manifold dimensions trekkies would call this subspace they cannot unfold near earth because they could be nuked but they can alter microscopic events they proceed mes up fundamental physics experiments like lhc stuff quantum computers purpose is freeze human scientific knowledge so human cannot ever understand subspace physics this will ensure when trisolaran space fleet arrives about 400 years human technology will still be relatively primitive plot future this should not freeze applied physics so nanotech developed by character wang maio will be key thing any defeat of trisolaris invasion one presumes or part of defeat it is shaping up as david vs goliath or guerilla war more precisely war of worlds bit too but humans bugs did mention trisolarians are really friggin mean nasty paranoid but you might be too if your planet going dive into your sun trisolarians have learned from evans that human science advances rapidly so would overtake trisolarians that time span have not got kicker yet ye wenjies daughter yang dong becomes theoretical physicist working on string theory doing experimental investigations this would be major area of science humans would defeat trisolarans we presume \u0026mdash our real world nah she becomes target of ai sophons sentient protons they mess up her experiments she concludes physics does not exist nihilistically gives up science except not so nihilistically she retires form science starts enjoy nature living without watching new media doing peaceful things her husband trouble is she logs onto her computer comes across old file saved by her mother which details ye wenjies plans allow trisolarians invade earth she recognizes betrayal of her mother not only against all humankind whatever her good motives but also against her own daughter it is due trisolarians that she could not pursue her first love theoretical physics we learn that her suicide note had deeper meaning she wrote physics does not exist never will exist she realized trisolarians going destroy humanity stopping physics progress their first strike method this is what sent yang dong into deeper depression \u0026mdash that her mother responsible at least for lighting fire she could not control last fatal straw she resigned physics not existing at planck scale but now learn that only because of trisolarian attack instigated by her mother well maybe most people cannot appreciate depravity of it but any scientist could empathize yang dong she first human outside eto factions who realized despair utter hopelessness of situation for future humankind so whoa am not sure if this magnificent scfi-fantasy story-telling or completely depraved by liu cixin physics module my brain says depraved dark forest wallfacers 2nd novel dark forest hints at some incipient human fight-back using plot device of wallfacer these are chosen humans just hand-full who will be given unparalleled resource access do do whatever hell they want minimalist un oversight their only brief is they cannot communicate anyone what their strategy is since sophons can see hear read all sophons however cannot read human thought thought-based warfare basically term wallfacer comes from meditation against blank wall trouble is only one of wallfacers luo ji seems know theyre not supposed blab or reveal their plans major plot failure here since they all sternly briefed on entire modus operandi of wallfacers which make sure no one has inkling of what they are up you might think lets nuke em pair are bluffing but then what waste of resource they are each commissioning ultra-fission bombs small stars sophons can halt nuclear reactions bros but young luo ji hes taking it easy giving up black-pilling choosing instead craft perfect woman lover live bohemian lifestyle paradise his is cheapest wallfacer strategy so far or is he hence some mystery intrigue just enough keep me reading no longer for sci of scifi but for mystery novel aspect character luo ji seems like real dick but you have think his strategy is look like dick all other wallfacers have nemesis eto wallbreaker who is there own personal assassin or disruptor whichever guess works if nothing else this is novel scifi device think so semi-cool guess continued militarism it is clear lui cixin has pretty warped view of humanity or at least has chosen that for his portrayals too much aggression militarism so he gets lot tom clancy sort of writing generals are dominant civilian leadership muted \u0026mdash except for un sec.gen ms say does author give her first name while wallfacers wallbreakers are terrific new think scifi plot devices found them degenerate into comedy this context comedy means too cartoonish be hard scifi respectable while fantasy scifi does not have be hard literature is superior when it is hard when it is not necessary be soft all such literary critique should be taken stride cannot write single novel im too lazy if did because am lazy itd probably read even more cartoonish but will not stfu as noted before am writing this mediation on three body problem for my own depression alleviation why are you still reading this anyhow it gratifying rumsfeld figure tyler got suicided lol you can see wallfacer bill hines hair-brained scheme of mind control is going turn out bunch of pseudo-religious meaning anti-religious nutters guessing plot is fun game would not write such plot un would not be so stupid they had veto over hair-brained wallfacer strategies fudge make mind control voluntary but any decent un committee would realize that is going create violent extremists who might win war but more likely will do more harm than good but fantasy story this could be funky bit of story-telling will not say it will be fun read because find it repugnant also disrespectful actual un its ideals but how story deals problem could be redeeming you do not need faith face of infinite odds against you you need courage for it does not matter if you win what matters is doing right thing when people think god is dead it is not even defeatism it is moral decay but anti liu cixin just because society has morally decayed does not mean all humans are bad its collectivist fallacy sure humanity is analogous superorganism but not equivalent humanity has no soul or moral conscience people do you have respect all levels glimpses of humanity first what am still doing here answer am still under pretty big shadow of anxiety depression but got all way through dark forest some nice scifi plot devices sort of cool healthy doses of both wild optimism plus nihilism which made good contrast though way extreme by serious it comedy novel black humour that is referring first bill hines biotech wallfacer who hair-brain engineers mind seal system brain washes people into bio hard-coded simple belief he uses it on himself convince himself his strategy is correct lol it takes balls write character like that into your novel some of other wild optimism of humanity once they realize they can propel spaceship faster than trisolarians is too comical but suppress your incredulity it makes good story trouble is it layered on bit too thick english translation which partly spoiled big surprise reveal when small perfectly mirrored strong force hardened trisolaran probe obliterated all human space force within minutes some hundred or thousand of battle ships armed expanse level rosinante weapons higher description of massacre bit thickly laid on too but guess justified black comedy outer space escaping fleet also too heavily laid on tragedy reader sympathetic humanity wants at least some of them make voluntary sacrifice negotiate avoid leaving survivors dark guilt trip but cest la vie guess its only damn scifi fantasy story author is entitled rank cynicism coup de grâce almost expecting it but is did mildly surprise me luo ji turns out defeat trisolarians m.a.d \u0026mdash mutually assured destruction \u0026mdash using greatest gamble ever half-baked theory of cosmic sociology took balls write that one too far too mush asimov insanity there but it residual cool at least it not harry seldon level incredulity worth reading because at very end pacifist from trisolaris reaches out luo ji understands both species have spiritual capacity for love it simply suppressed among trisolarans.understnadbly \u0026mdash who has time go mad love when next second you might have dehydrate hope third novel deaths end does not cynically ruin this for on earth trisolarian need dehydrate no more amen my biggest fear friggin time travel will ruin story once scifi author allows time travel well it loses appeal for me its like parallel worlds stuff belongs only glossy colourful marvel comics most horrific cautionary tale on way appreciated first two novels is as parody they paint grime portrait of stupidity of humanity but one might say suitably caricatured into hyperbole no longer think this is liu cixins politics being projected into reader it is more cautionary tale still think cixins politics are bit heavy handed smack of neoconservatism but they are what they are dont let them get way of other lessons one can glean this respect remembrance of earths past is not adding anything new our view of ourselves reflected mirror of scifi fantasy but it is new horror story this idea universe is full of life so full it is competitive hyper-darwinistic is what would say can be allegory for our life here on earth bloody social darminwists its insane how their kind infiltrated popular culture so deeply only lorde taylor swift can save us great philosopher miley cyrus but choose for us \u0026mdash if had proverbial magic wand \u0026mdash take higher road of defying m.a.d option going all out for altruism peace humanity can do it my optimism exceed cixins pessimism neoconservatism moreover if given magic wand would not wave it would burn it let everyone know greater thing is forge peace ourselves everyone it together no lord savior would say this even knowing there is god true god not alien overlord put us here solve our own problems both individually socially magic wand would be redundant stupid defeating entire purpose of human existence no it is not only because know mmt lol ive known my life more betrayal than ye wenjie story ive wanted die so many times just be rid of suffering still would not betray humanity like she did would rather suffer alone than betray anyone applying copernican principle think most people would be more like myself than theyd be like ye wenjie you can take your own lessons from cautionary tale what take is that some scifi fantasy stories can distort mirror they portend hold front of collective humanity that distortion you can see how we should not behave how we will not behave first of all lets just kill all neoliberals though why horror just my reading ok it is horror story another terrific more hard scifi read qas greg egans diaspora it also horror end meaningless or as next it but its from materialist worldview so end comedy for someone like me it good journey of read though as are most egan novels last novel liu cixin trilogy deaths end seems get even more horrific after tense peaceful stand-off of dark forest craziest mad m.a.d do believe effectiveness of nuclear deterrence under some conditions but think it is horror that we are born surpass it is not supposed be forever dark forests ultra-dariwninst cosmic sociology m.a.d is next level horror though found it disappointing as scifi vision which is why am reclassifying remembrance of earths past as horror genre but lot of popular scifi is horror more than it is scifi deaths end does not seem be changing course but it raises very interesting issue that am sure we here real world will be contemplating debating some already do which is cheating death deaths end cryogenic revival is chosen method rather than upload into silicon minds but guess being computer nerd liu cixin might yet pull that one out too thats be ultra disappointing but thats just me find it horrific that wed even get choice continue living physical realm but if you are pseudo-religious have utter faith physical materialism guess youd leap at chance live this world forever eating up finite resources that might otherwise nourish soul who now will never be born because of your vanity if humans ever did for real manage cheat death wed be destroying life on epic tragic unseen cosmic scale more ways than one this is ultimate horror show cannot imagine worse deaths ending well whaddya know liked way remembrance of earths past concluded but lost macroeconomics \u0026amp mmt analogy game story got too fantastical have not thought too much about mmt recently bother keeping up my analogy within analogy it is after all much better take only first level metaphorical lessons from remembrance of earths past here are my take-aways cautionary tale \u0026mdash lets not keep being resource hoarders fascists our own homes human civilization can surely overcome adolescent stage of internecine conflict liu cixin needs assume not for long arc storyline of endless fighting conflict boring scifi is open \u0026mdash better stories there is spiritual scifi novel yet be written it would have completely different plot structure would introduce entirely new trope whats new trope called before it is trope scifi is open \u0026mdash if you understand mmt then you can write scifi stories like kim stanley robinson but if you know just little about spiritual aspects human beings or other sentient aliens youd know conscious sentience is non-physical origin this opens up non-fantastical but spiritual hard scifi stories just ask what if not-so-distant future most human beings realize our existence is physical universe but not entirely write great hard scifi you need believability plausibility or conceivability lui cixin did not have all that pocket universes \u0026mdash great metaphor for resource hoarding selfishness but it probably worked out end ok for cheng xin guan yifan trouble is cixin has not encountered neil turok latham boyle nor considered sir roger penroses cosmological models our universe probably is open positive cosmological constant that is probably very good thing because that is way information could cross cosmic aeon boundary both turok \u0026amp boyle lasenby or penrose conformal futures either of these three should work out for our descendants one or other anti-cixin \u0026mdash my summary quote from literature would be from bahá‘u‘lláh‘s hidden words ye rich ones on earth poor your midst are my trust guard ye my trust be not intent only on your own ease spiritual macronomics is inverse microeconomics \u0026mdash moslers aphorism economics is opposite of religion it is better receive than give ah yes but thats microeconomics there is also mmt aphorism borrowed from convention keynes one of fallacies of composition or paradox of thrift net savers are enemy of macroeconomics net spenders are life-blood of economic system if anyone needs know voice hidden words is not that of baháulláh here it is meditation from words allegorically uttered muhammads daughter fatima \u0026mdash probably dream \u0026mdash after muhammads passing console her full title of tablet is hidden words of fatima when you know baháʼí

trying nzstats app tool which might be way extract some of our fiscal data if someone knows how do this already please tell me apart from just getting data first place monthly series is longest interval acceptable main noticeable thing when peruse various sources is prevalence of monetarist thinking language all nz government debt sources frame data descriptions terms of scary liabilities of our government this is true enough but language is very curious from mmt point-of-view it is always as if government debt is bad thing not mention this whole superannuation silliness need hold foreign reserves need hold foreign reserves betrays fixed exchange rate mentality or at minimum mindset of some sort of need control or manage nzd exchange rate we of course have no need whatsoever be spending human resources doing such financial management that we do employ people do this work is financial mismanagement but try telling that treasury official all you will hear back is crickets guess these are not really research notes more like research frustrations aired beveridge curves only tangentially related reading post on substack by mike alexander on topic of beveridge curves believe guy is mmt aware also what he noted as conventional explanation for covid era inflation probably not his conception he merely reporting here is report return curve following pandemic is even higher than return after financial crisis it passes into tight region at unemployment level just bit below 6% yet no wage growth observed instead we got inflation standard explanation for this supply disruptions government stimulus-enhanced demand gave rise inflation that offset nominal wage gains stemming from labor market tightness fed raised interest rates dramatically response bout of inflation annual inflation rate subsided from peak around 9% mid-2022 around 3% year later after this it has remained largely unchanged wage increases did not commence once this happened rather vacancies have been shrinking suggested that rather than raising wages acquire workers fully staff their operations businesses prefer keep higher profit margins they achieved during inflation by hiking prices by more than costs rose it is also possible that higher interest rates are increasing business costs putting additional pressure minimize growth wage bill there is quite bit there that needs mmt caveats there is no reason suppose fed raising rates caused decline inflation why not put it down supply chains being restored wages will not rise unless there is government fiscal injection support while fed keeps rates high businesses or at least financial sector can earn free basic income by purchasing tsy bonds so have no hard drive produce more real output makes sales profit they might not buy bonds eventually preferring riskier instruments but option will always be there at least whole fed thinks monetarism is still accurate analysis framework wage demands can be cause of one-off increases price level but have never been source of inflation continual increase price level likewise corporate price gouging is not continuous so is also not cause of inflation it can look like inflation of course but only if government supports long-term via fiscal injections avoid credit crunches such state life-support for price gougers can look like inflation if it becomes habit even foreign oil monopolist setting price is only one-off adjustment price level it too can look like inflation if it becomes habitual see duelling monopolies id like do more modelling substantiate this claim but think continual inflation at some base rate around 3% is always caused by government monopolist setting price of currency aka central bank interest rate central banks do this set non-zero interest rate only because they are operating under something like fixed exchange rate mentality or either that or pure monetarist ideology both of which are null frameworks for analysis when country is operating floating exchange rate of non- convertible currency which functions primarily as tax credit yeah yeah you can through all realism you like at me know realpolitik know why things

costs real resource costs for superconducting supercollider would not be all that much pretty insignificant certainly not inflation risk more point not starvation risk ssc is not going put farmers or builders out of business so made my comments @048 one thing you neoliberals need understand change your mind about obviously is that monetary cost is irrelevant for currency issuing monopoly government or emu case ecb cost for governments is always only real terms every state mandated project must take real resources out of private sector employ them public sector nation faces two choices either wait interminably long for private sector provide for-profit green transport or make it public priority if then it can be done easily provided real resources are available it would not be question of finding money governments create currency by computer entries problem here is purely political neoliberals do not accept reality of state currency operations they believe private market as wealth creator true real terms null currency terms of course obviously third possibility is available government can always provide financial incentives private industry produce environmentally friendly transport systems why because as said they have no problem issuing currency its literally scorepoints on ledger aka tax credits how either by contracting or subsidy idea here would be have decent oversight so there is no free corporate welfare or cronyism subsidies or contracts need be for public purpose not private profit private owner of contracted companies should be held accountable public use of limited liability legislation has have quid pro quo which is democratic workplace for any company seeking government contracts or subsidies neoliberal libertarian governments will never do any of this we gotta get rid of them somehow another comment necessary @230 this is madness you have not done research sabine or are parroting macroeconomic ignorance private sector cannot create currency itd be illegal counterfeit they could spend what they hoarded but good luck getting capitalists release their hoards of bank scorepoints for public purpose banks can issue credit which can circulate for while but all nations outside emu government is sole source of fresh currency by keystrokes no tax-payer is needed tax payments are redemption operation driving demand for currency not funding operation private sector can supply needed real resources \u0026mdash workers primarily whatever equipment corporates own they can always be contracted for public purpose use at fair price hence no inflation if they ask higher price government can choose tax them \u0026mdash but not get money rather release real resources thats purpose of tax move real resources from private sector into public sector government immediately issues currency that is needed pay tax once corporation is willing put its resources use for public purpose thats called state hiring unemployed resources it just created by imposing tax eliminating unemployment it generated eliminating bullsh$\\ast$t jobs people will often complain about how idealistic youth are desire greener economy typical reaction might be you cant just have free range chickensbig farming must grow food or millions starve so just be realistic be realistic fine words but all too often worry they conceal total lack of imagination such cases it really is heterological chickens is just one of many examples bullsh$\\ast$t jobs are both another example general case for solution people mean neoliberals might for instance complain well we cannot just eliminate bullsh$\\ast$t jobs what else would people do\u0026quot answer is raise free range chickens of course there is no end of good things people can do which are not getting done there are about 40% of wasted human lives living bullsh$\\ast$t jobs who could be doing those good things another 20% of people who are able work can willing who cannot find employment you do math how can we eliminate all unemployment all bullsh$\\ast$t jobs fill up infinitesimal fraction of endless list of jobs people could be doig which are not getting done hilbert roosters hotel is what am calling it wrecking power grid one argument against mass conversion electric vehicles is disruption power grids this is probably fair enough worry but what about mass public transport dedicated power so not on grid am mad or do neoliberals profoundly lack imagination think they lack imagination by design since their whole shtick is allow free market sort it out where it is basically any problem including getting votes parliament presume.😂 having said that we are electricity constrained so any such share of electric power generation for public transport has be capacity we build itll likely not work logistically or politically sequester existing power utility output for mass public transport iea estimate is electric grid nation needs expand about 25% faster next decade than it did previous decade hossenfelder scare-mongers about this being diabolically hard impossible but any mmt understanding would say it could be easy if problem is not insufficient real resources then it is not economic nor monetary problem it is political problem what if you en masse your country just dont like public transport for you lithuanians private electric transition estimate is that usa europe would need double investment upgrade grid allow private electric vehicle infrastructure probably same for lithuanian then but oh no what tax payers will want fund this maybe real resources for 25% extension of electric grid are insufficient at present for 10 year extension but we do have resources problem is rate of build if that is real constraint then obviously governments will need apply other measures like rationing existing electricity or employing alternative public transport systems transition period burn more fossil eliminate fossil that is say eliminate oil for transport we cannot eliminate oil for vital chemical industries without going little bit luddite not that im opposed bit of luddite return nature just cannot muster up extremist alarmism about it sorry why not

mathematical physicist is not ticket out of normiehood employing people for public good purpose is of course not lock-down what call policy do not have fancy phrase but idea is give workers simple

these guys seem be of decent variety there is trace of hint of some level of concern for plight of poor their work wealth reallocation models there are many simple models for how financial wealth gets distributed unfortunately most are politically neutral or politically agnostic so all are unrealistic however they are empirically accurate how can that be firstly modelling macroeconomics is lot like some aspects of statistical mechanics where there can be phenomena akin multiple realization meaning more than one underlying dynamics or set of governing rules could determine same qualitative macroscopic behaviour secondly real world governments do not behave as if they have monopoly control of their own tax credits aka currency so lot of economic injustices occur due plain ignorance \u0026mdash massively tragic form of banal evil if governments cause unemployment first place as mmt shows then morally agnostic government operating according quasi free market ideology \u0026mdash welfare for rich rugged individualism for poor \u0026mdash will practically guarantee end results that are pareto tailed \u0026mdash rich get richer econophysics bros models capture such politically agnostic dynamics only problem is they fail realize this is political mismanagement on epic tragic scale it is not agnosticism at all sure you might be justified claiming absent currency monopoly there would be some kind of free market then those models become applicable result is free market always evolves extreme injustice \u0026mdash highly unequal distribution of financial wealth hence real wealth too since financial wealth equates real purchasing power more money scorepoints you can rake from rentier activity more you can purchase without reduction your hoard of financial scorepoints am not claiming any particular reason econophysics models seem accurately account for real world wealth distribution just pointing out some possible explanations butone thing is for certain real world data is drawn from nations that run mmt systems so it is clear that governments these nations have operational ability eliminate pareto tails ensure fair \u0026amp just wealth distributions meaning if politics good serving public purpose then econophysics bros \u0026lsquomodels would be wrong that is really my main point today econophysics models might be correctly capturing some aspects of macroeconomic real-world dynamics but main point make is that this does not mean real world should be as it is we could do much better negative $\\tau$ simple stochastic geometric brownian motion model for wealth reallocation is definitely politically agnostic model so pretty disgusting but that is because our political economy is pretty disgusting yes for sure all you enlightenment nerds human civilization has progressed for good so many ways but that does not imply we are at stage of decent political economy it just means all past human history where power elites have been found it has been diabolically nasty brutal yonatan berman’s model main control parameter $\\tau$ allows for interactions between individuals this is what allows dynamics become non-ergodic it is seriously important econophysics because ergodicity is thought be characteristic of real-world under typical circumstances long time average of distribution of wealth is same as average over all infinite possible ensembles why so seriously important it is because these econophysics models are all about statistical mechanics so statistical characteristics are only thing they need get right so they need get nonergodicity \u0026mdash other statistical characterizations \u0026mdash right if nothing else models where time average does not equal ensemble average are non-ergodic this is real-world situation when there are increasing returns wealth decreasing returns poor gilded age great depression neoliberal era are possible non-ergodic periods our recent history times when rich got not only richer but obscenely richer \u0026mdash relative terms base model is random multiplicative growth \u0026mdash which means growth wealth over distribution is dominated completely by random exchange this is non-ergodic first adjustment for reality is reallocation term parameter $\\tau$ which governs how one individual contribute aa fraction of their wealth every time period common pool this pool is then split evenly between everyone model is very simple $$ dx_i x_i \\left\\mu dt \\sigma\\ dw_i t\\right \\tau\\leftx_i \\braket{x}_n\\right\\ dt $$ first term parentheses is geometric brownian random exchange effect second is reallocation for simple analysis $\\tau$ is taken be same for everyone which means amount of wealth put into common pool is same proportion of individuals current wealth rich contribute more than poor but equal percentages for $\\tau0$ people wealth greater than population mean $\\braket{x}_n$ is net contributor while poorer are net receivers this is ergodic regime technically reallocation model is ergodic if $\\tau tau_c$ for some threshold $\\tau_c$ but for large enough population $\\tau_c \\approx 0$ ergodic regime rescaled wealth converges time although it still has disgusting pareto tail technically inverse $\\gamma$ distribution it is at least telling us that government have role play fairly redistributing nominal wealth why because real world everyone knows redistribution does not occur rich can afford tax evasion poor not only have tax burden but also tend need borrow from banks just not starve \u0026mdash through no fault of their own why hell are they being taxed there is no good reason particular models show that times when real world effective $\\tau 0$ are times of increasing return rich when inequality soars these are non-ergodic periods it is pretty revealing see data estimates showing periods recent history where such instability occurs following screenshot is barmans data light grey bands are regions where $\\tau 0$ for usa non-ergodic regimes where wealth inequality grows people negative wealth arise for $\\tau 0$ dynamics are non-ergodic one interesting thing is that berman characterizes this regime by effect on poorest this regime some individuals end up negative wealth even if all start positive wealth long neoliberal era period from 1980 today where $\\tau 0$ is as story of new gilded age crushing for poor working middle class boom times for rentiers grifters currently then under present government policy pretty much across world we are terrible era of non-ergodic wealth allocation effects $\\tau reallocations are from poor rich what it also shows is that default assumptions mainstream economics that reallocation is ergodic are unjustified often downright invalid but that is most mild criticism of mainstream economics mean hells bells everyone knows political economy is unjust we did not need model tells us this is due non-ergodicity without incredible unheard of charity altruism on global scale itd be unjust even ergodic regimes given present neoliberal policy dominance what more can be said well know helluva lot more people need know mmt governments need know what full policy space available monopoly currency issuer is if only so they know their policy is designed benefit rich crush poor first step denouncing neoliberalism is know what policy does why policy is stupid at best horrific class warfare at worst tantamount murder by government design or ignorance you cannot claim moral righteousness if you think there is no alternative interest rate effects although mmt scholarship is pretty clear interest rate effects it is not crystal clear because macroeconomics is highly non-linear dynamical non-linear interest rate have perverse effects meaning they can be pro-inflationary most oftne but under some conditions can stifle effective demand lse egodicityecon group have write-up where they advocate low interest rates but thought they offer incorrect analysis so wrote this comment them hey your write-up https ergodicityeconomics.com 2017 08 14 wealth-redistribution-and-interest-rates you get interest rates slightly wrong most loans are fixed rate so lowering interest rate does not help poor too much except slow down inflation high rates are one-to-one pro-inflationary through interest-income forward price effects given propensities of savers spend borrowers save are empirically about equal but fact moderate inflation helps bit fixed rate debt since it means higher nominal income servicing fixed rate debt it still sucks that most lower income families debt have also pay higher cpi prices but nevertheless if they stay afloat moderate rate of inflation helps them pay off fixed rate debts faster which means higher interest rate tomorrow helps them pay off past lower fixed rate debt more serious inequality issue is debts that cannot be repaid out of income flow debts that cannot be paid should be forgiven since macro they are drag on effective demand or currency circulation we all know healthy effective demand is healthy economy debts that can be repaid can be serviced out of income flow that suggests decent wages buttressed by job guarantee wage floor is superior policy ineffective monetary policy it is called fiscal dominance yeah central bank interest rates should be permanent zero zirp this is non-inflationary once you understand source of price level chartered banks can always operate for profit from spread rate they always do they can make loans regardless of cb rate constraint on bank credit is number of credit-worthy borrowers banks do not lend reserves or deposits they issue credit simply by marking-up customers bank account currency is created ex nihilo receipt of promissory note repay also form of credit card agreement licensed software operationally does not permit bank lends reserves or deposits moving around deposits is what non-bank trusts need do since they do not have access legal means create currency ex nihilo if they tried theyd be jailed for counterfeit chartered banks do not operate like this they have license create currency ex nihilo by computer account entries albeit severe penalties for fraudulent issuance \u0026mdash they do need find or generate credit-worthy borrower guess what helps create more credit-worthy customers \u0026mdash higher cb rate since cb treasury rate is essentially basic income scheme basic income but only for people who already have money proportion how much money they already have.\u0026quot follow-up as for folks who fear forgiving debts can lead instability rampant inflation let me just say they are ignoramuses effective demand has never been cause of hyperinflation causation goes other way usually war reparations massive corruption or severe natural disasters cause moderate inflation is good thing \u0026mdash it erodes purchasing power of hoarded wealth encourages more circulation reduces burden of past debt provided wages go way get wages going is via job guarantee wage floor cb sets interest rate floor by votes parliament must set wage floor also by vote there is no market force obstacle at play for monopoly currency issuer unless politicians nullly act as if there is market pressure they can tell bond traders pi55 off government does not need borrow its own fiat currency tax returns bonds do not finance government taxes help resource government real terms \u0026mdash tax liability generates demand for otherwise worthless currency tsy bonds are interest rate maintenance operation asset swap not borrowing operation discipline on banks has be understood it never works out if liability side is chosen as place for discipline for starters no customers know risk think they do is laughable proper place for discipline is on asset side proper policy is give banks unlimited overdraft at cb ensure payments clearing discipline banks on asset side you tell banks only what they can do that is run payments clearing assess credit worthiness do not allow them anything else bankers are dangerous animals need be kept cages quite bit of channelling mosler goat there which will always do given half chance all we need is warp drive want return my main point econophysics models might be correctly capturing some aspects of macroeconomic real-world dynamics but main point make is that this does not mean real world should be as it is we could do much better we can do better without any heavy-handed social engineering or forced communism or like we can do better simply if governments understand they have at least tow unique powerful monopoly instruments legal monetary system former includes military police power we have real serious democratic control of our governments meaning they bend peoples will not will of oligarchs when write simply if please know that realize this does not mean politically or sociologically simple it means operationally simple politics messes you up all we need is correct moral ethical political will do good is phrase lot like interstellar travel plans all we need is warp drive however am not pessimist nor nihilist we can find this macroeconomics warp drive it is not scifi fantasy that is because macroeconomics warp drive is not physical thing it does not have be materially engineered it is spiritual reality it is love for other people compassion trustworthiness humility compassion justice mercy forgiveness wisdom that is our political economy warp drive it costs nothing material get it it costs suppression of ego greed which is why it seems incredibly hard get no one can legislate better morality moral ethical transformation has be learned nurtured grown fostered metaphorical water of wisdom kindness power this is something everyone who learns mmt eventually comes appreciate mmt is necessary step battle but it is only first step yeah it can be taken parallel other steps but once you realize government has amazing monopoly powers you realize magnitude of task ahead those wielding that power fail acknowledge mmt hide their wilful or innocent ignorance behind veils of let markets do their

my mathematics interests but you know it gonna be tinged neoliberal hate lol story broadcast on cbs 60 minutes here \u0026mdash it is freakin great story poorly presented except well-presented all professionalism of corporate news poorly presented terms of real economy real education real creativity two high school students calcea johnson nekiya jackson seniors at st marys academy independently discovered new proofs of pythagoras theorem using only trigonometry at 2min episode both students claim they interested solving bonus question their teacher had given on test for monetary prize incentive us$500 nothing sneeze at for high school students but why did cbs have air that soundbite cos theyre neoliberal let me rant bit about why this big deal before getting core of this post which is why prize incentive rotten why such big deal trigonometry ratios of sides of triangles \u0026mdash nothing more \u0026mdash had not been able yield proof of pythagoras theorem for over two thousand years until jason zimba 2007 it is well worth reading that paper it is easy read although calcea nekiya given puzzle by same teacher both knew other trying solve it they worked independently each discovered different new proof finding new proofs of old theorems is hard enough itself let alone finding one most mathematicians considered impossible non-circular proof for macroeconomists let me just say that very very good mathematicians had conjectured that that proof of pythagoras theorem using only trigonometry functions would be circular that it would assume $$ \\sin^2\\theta \\cos^2\\theta $$ which is of course pythagoras theorem you cannot assume proof what you are trying prove btw see this lot crackpot physics people often try derive masses of elementary particles but they more often than not have implicitly assumed empirical mass for electron for example people will take compton wavelength as their data problem prize money problem extrinsic rewards entirely any decent mathematician would not be solving such problem for prize money effort students put worth far more than us$500 if they had been paid wage work on puzzle they should have been paid work on it if money goal but while being paid wage does not mean one is not learning not being paid wage should not be price of learning price of learning at school should be real resources going teaching learning money should not be question just pay teachers decent living wage hire them locally hire all of them cut down class size ratio prize monies are often like this except perhaps for million dollar clay millenium prizes nobel or abel those bigger prizes recognize lifetime achievements so are fair compensation for sacrificing lot work on serious mathematics for most people they are more than wage problem is that they are only wage for one person this degrades demeans effort of all other people who support prize winner anyone ever heard of standing on shoulders of giants no of course youre ayn rand acolyte lol alfie kohn dare say would agree me twittxr might not but im no longer involved that swamp nuances of wages am not saying students should be paid go school that issue is entirely different public education is investment it should be fully funded up available teaching resources we should not even worry about pay-off since pay-off is incalculable but whatever it is it is yuuuuge private schools like st mary’s academy need be crowded out because they are elitist placements of calcea nekiya are at school mean other less catholic students do not get place this is not their fault of course im saying it is systematic problem private schools not only do they consume more resources per student than current public schools parents are paying for these they shouldnt be there is no reason public schools cannot be as nice hygienic as these private schools private schools prove real resources are available sure sure admitting less desirable students into schools messes up pristine learning environment for these gifted kids thats whole other problem though for another day you cannot ignore it though otherwise you give fodder for elites who demand their kids go pristine school if they pay money am not trying skirt this issue am just writing about different issue today prizes \u0026amp rewards issue let me just say though that such elitist claptrap can be defeated if we eliminate poverty allow riffraff kids have dignified living environment decent breakfast parents who are not bitterly struggling survive who have time read their children dr suess stories or whatever better stories are spike milligan besides all this we society do pay for children go school we pay terms of real resources committed schools \u0026mdash both private public as long as we all are paying real terms teachers especially their labour time think we should demand public schools get premium resources will this crowd-out private schools yes think so good riddance what about motive puzzle solving motive is only motive students needed would they then bother solve problem who knows but they did not need money prize motive why not because they should have been take care of materially or their parents should have been taken care of decent wages take money incentive off table \u0026mdash unless it is socially necessary sh1t job since solving mathematics puzzles is not sh1t job we can therefore should take money off table by providing for students needs by providing for their parents or guardians needs but pedant asks what if students then did not bother say two things this foolishness so what if they did not bother work on puzzle then no one dies they lose out on chance of discovery people lose such chances all time what you do not know you lost will not hurt you this would more likely than not reveal students not truly motivated by money prize because bet finances not issue theyd still have worked on puzzle everyone is capable of providing their own incentive if you crack puzzle treat yourself movie \u0026mdash or whatever floats your boat guess suck at arithmetic it is profound lack of creativity think students had no motive other than money it is reality they fact motivated by monetary prize because them us$500 dollars lot of dinero but thats utterly beside my point but dont wages encrudify labour dont know about that as stated for sh1t jobs wages are bl00dy good for enjoyable jobs we still compensate workers because it is right thing do even if worker is having such wonderful larking time of it they cannot care about money this case we${}^\\ast$ take money off table by paying wage that is fair just above what worker considers fine enough not care about amount care more about work enjoyment or utility or both ${}^\\ast$who is this we you might ask mean we if supreme dictator or failing that simple democracy full of nasty plebs who simply want their fair say rules of our society but then neoliberal wank3r utters wage destroys competition mean sure wage student can take their own fw33t sucking time trying crack mathematics puzzle but what student you know would be taking their sw33t a$$ time none know there is always competition sciences because others can discover thing first then youve really cocked it up discoveries are not like hamburgers first one made is only one made unless you get lucky original hamburger gets lost sands of time there is exception for school pedagogy it is great thing give students solved problem but get them try rediscover solution there is still marvellous thrill this but its not same however this pedagogical thrill of re-discovery is even more important than original discovery precisely because it is hamburgers fries of mathematics science feeds masses but again it is profound lack of creativity think students cannot motivate themselves when they are waged or have their financial cares met how would motivate myself some pressure thats so easy can think of million ways \u0026mdash which is say million ways my girlfriend can achieve orgasm what about teacher wishing motivate their students well for heavens sake do not offer prize you can put deadline on puzzle for recognition but even deadlines are for dummies you can instead just talk students shock \u0026amp horror does talking even work cannot imagine hey calcea nekiya so you like this challenge problem well this is tough one it might take long time much effort many daydreams at end of six months you might get nowhere like all humankind for two thousand years except process youll have learned so much interesting geometry your brain will swell your mind will be both humbled proud think about that now do you want give yourself constraint as challenge say months but then move on new puzzle then you might say look if you also want some candy as prize weve got $500 from school kitty thatll get all chocolate you need for year give yourselves that if you crack puzzle but work on it because itll grow your mind not your belly but personally would not add that bit its real enshittification am mean \u0026amp nasty teacher maybe but no student of mine ever told me so be clear if we are not making whole families of students then yeah would should damn well offer wage or prize for open puzzles prefer wage because there is lot of work be done no guarantee of success but it is poor system that requires this enshittification neoliberalization of education cuts deep has created festering wound on our society here kids work on this teacher will give you candies but if you cannot solve it then pi55 off because you deserve f-all proportion of billion times your present wage summary based-mmt thoughts well $i$ think theyre based most people are perfectly capable of motivating themselves

up on demystifysci podcast here awesome gotta celebrate podcasters prepared upload over two hours guy like warren talking about monetary operations 101 couple of issues raised by hostess dr anastasia bendebury piqued my interest since warren not able fill all gaps stock market issue is warren most mmters suspect favour zirp zero interest rate central bank tsy policy which means any tsy bonds issued provide zero interest serve purpose only maintain smooth reserve account operations this is not strictly necessary since act could be changed permit member banks overdrafts but avoid lot of legal bill debate drafting tsy could just issue 3-month bills repo operations so banks can clear payments without overdrafts cannot do reserve drain without reserve add stuff whats issue again aside from getting parliament approve this elimination of bond market complete waste of human lives concern raised by anastasia wouldnt money just plough into stocks response implicit think by mosler warren had already addressed deeper problem of why there are such powerful savings incentives which tend paradox of thrift force governments run deficits large deficits if people really do not like large numbers for whatever reason numerophobia they governments should stop creating massive artificial savings incentives case closed however perhaps anastasia meant that it could be concern that people put money into riskier assets but again so what what warren did not have time mention his proposal for eliminating stock market casino idea is cap stock prices at say $20 if firm needs more capital they can issue more shares thats it but it raised question emailed warren what about implementing proposal eliminate bond market implement stock market stability proposal its same story for monopolists you have options you can set price let quantity float or fix quantity if you are prepared for price be volatile ill make note here if warren offers comment my guess is minimal disruption could be simply on day=1 sec dictates no stock can go above $20 all existing stock holders get new shares match their current portfolio valuation my feeling is massive political backlash from bond market bros stock market phreaks but again so what let them cry no one stocks will lose any investments their methodology for analyzing market will have change but so what theyre not all dummies most can drive spreadsheet payroll tax elimination this biggie think it is grand daddy of all mmt ideas besides public sector employment proposals job guarantee although even warren seemed vague on actual gdp fractions that we waste on useless human activity but lets suppose ballpark is tax compliance costs around 10% of gdp on bullsh1t jobs payroll tax about 15% of gdp on bullsh1t tax revenue tax avoidance accountants all rest bond markets around 3% of gdp on bullsh1t trading stock market gambling about 5% of gdp on bullsh1t investment gambling financial sector about 5% of humans are calling themselves financiers about are not financing anything they are parasites rentiers we do not need 99% of so-called finance sector when write suppose ballpark you are correct noting thats huge fudge have no idea what percentages are within $\\pm 5%$ or even worse my point today is more qualitative yet recognize it must rest on some large percentages here mean hellsbells you can see how very rough estimates might even get above 100% of gdp thatd just mean your estimates way off but any case it suggests we are losing incredible tragic amount of human time energy on pointless activity meaning pointless mmt context ive no beef people who see need trade bonds or invest stocks because existing government institutional structure practically forces them save we are talking here about what could be what should be through mmt lens elimination proposals am concerned here about political process mmters need give advice policy makers governments make transitions run smoothly but some of them can be sharp im no expert on elimination of bullsh1t strategies but for starters id guess tax compliance costs just implement robust property taxes no change other taxes just set other non-pigovian reverse pigovian tax rates zero implement job guarantee so newly unemployed have oodles of decent dignified things do for income while transitioning back non-bs jobs payroll gst tax just set these zero no need go through political hassle of changing tax statutes since no gst payroll tax forms need be submitted now that gst hassle family finance hassle disappears freeing up substantial amount of government deficit for spending probably also along other tax compliance eliminations frees up around 20% of workforce do better things think requires jg again because of all tax attorneys accountant put out of work bond markets government moves only issuance of zirp 3-month tsy bills for payments clearing operations run smoothly stock market gambling mosler proposal financial sector several proposals but my mind big one would be eliminate tax advantaged savings schemes increase pension decent living income scrap national superannuation total waste of human time these simple policies not saying theyd be easy political battles win we get something like 30 40% of gdp going towards raising standards of living reducing work hours no economic downside thats massive just think about it inflation from oil price other big issue raised by anastasia fear over collapse of dollar due sequence of implausible events warren asked her give me example where thats happened which although bit flippant is best response we would not get collapse of dollar provided government continues enforce tax liabilities period everything else for government deficit issuance is policy choice do we want spend significant fractions of gdp building bridges or on blowing up bridges could there be inflationary episodes from those foreign monopolies setting price sure no political process absent invading those foreigners or cia assassinations can prevent them but we do not need assassinations or invasions only mmt lens explains why not eliminate stock market casino demystifysci hosts asked about money going into stock market if bonds eliminated or zirp it reminded me of moslers proposal for stocks set price cap at $20 per companies can then just issue more eliminate casino checked warren ask him about this proposal if he had any revisions he replied as courteously as usual answer yes new issues come at $\\text{\\small \\$}$10 company is required issue unlimited shares for sale at $\\text{\\small \\$}$20 had few related follow-ups warren generous reply question how could you see government implementing this practically transition period answer immediately subject all new issues this requirement immediately require all existing listed companies offer unlimited shares for sale at price maybe 25% above latest closing market price. question do not know how exchanges are organized but most countries there is something like sec right so theyd just dictate new terms coming from government direction statutes answer corporations have charters that subject them gov reg.s exchange for limited liability they can go back partnerships sole proprietorships any time lose gov granted limited liability question did you have any idea for how make such transition least

wine his past appearances age well intellectual wine for me dont drink intoxicants except coffee healthy body healthy mind all that mosler at berkely forum c.2022 this aged mosler goes down well but youtube comments section is something hardly ever get read since im typically too early see critics or far too late be bothered but for this one had few comments make myth of barter good ol rob inserts his usual simplistic critique of mmt he points out for case of pre-colonial africa mosler is saying there non-monetary economy until british came force natives grow coffee by imposing coercive tax liabilities \u0026mdash infamous downright cruel hut tax rob claims mosler is being contradictory randall wray since wray insists there never pure barter economies thing is both mosler wray are correct it is far too simplistic say barter equals non-monetary its logical subset fallacy non-monetary is far larger category than barter \u0026mdash when we define money very specific terms state tax credits broader definition of money then barter economy can be seen be monetary economy just not using tax credit but extent such small economy is using type of account record it is not pure barter pure barter you cannot put anything on credit where can you find such economies they are rare tend be village level size everyone knows everyone else meaning little need for account records my counter note that barter vs non-monetary are two different things there is overlap but not perfect coincidence no large scale economies have ever been barter it is too inefficient people know it instinctively there are thus always accounting records records of who owes whom what technically that is monetary system but not sense mosler talks about mosler is talking specifically about fiat currency driven by coercive tax liabilities not just accounting records but simple economy large number of people who cannot afford trust each other blindly there will be accounting records that is money never pure barter few households can run pure barter but not more than few thousand governments are implementing mmt this is giant wtf one youtube poster essentially blaming mmt for all ills of todays inflations etc usual straw-man attack on mmt my counter no government is implementing mmt recommended policy zirp jg eliminate payroll tax vat gst but all governments outside emu have mmt operations system you cannot legitimately criticize mmt for politicians who do not understand their own currency system mmt activists have been struggling for decades trying get politicians understand they either do refuse admit it or choose be ignorant for their own political purposes as phil waller few others remarked where is country implementing job guarantee not even mmt japan is implementing interesting thing here is that tax return is often considered deflationary but demand withdrawal but thats slight myth tax liabilities drive demand tax returns withdraw demand but do not immediately alter prices firm have actively reduce prices clear sales but they tend not too especially these days credit cards all around it might be whole different story of not for credit cards overdraughts fact it would be totally different but as things stand today tax return does not actively lower price level it can prevent prices from going up too fast tax drains certainly tend suppress stock market for week or so \u0026mdash hardly catastrophe for real economy more interesting thing is vast free-up real terms when payroll gst taxes are eliminated mosler estimates it would free up around 10% of gdp maybe more governments seem have no clue about this probably do not know massive amount of wasted human lives spent on needless tax compliance eliminating gst payroll taxes would likely be inflation neutral mid-term since although increasing effective demand it frees up huge amount of human labour hours do better things what is demanded when gst payroll taxes are dropped 0% rate would be offset fiscal policy employ newly unemployed we could call that job guarantee but really there is no good reason use jg this way it is abuse proper thing do would be employ all those unemployed tax

course mitchell we wake up every day severe labour shortages inflation fear-mongering usual critics appear blaming mmt for inflation at this point history am almost prepared ignore them theyve become total idiots few years ago maybe they excusable since mmt largely unknown but there is no excuse today you can get models that are mainstream is_lm dsge models that are more mmt-like compare mainstream models are just plain wrong on empirical evidence douglas boys over at appliedmmt are trading almost naïve way which should not work at all but they make winning trades because theyre using mmt lens main comment make on inflation defined as term structure of prices faced by consumers today nominal inflation is never economic problem it is psychological problem gets you voted out of office sometimes real inflation is killer for low income households but that is not new mmt its just obvious note that when we talk about term structure of prices then that is rate of change measure time period is denominator or at least that is implicit look at table of term structure divide price differences by time interval you roughly get inflation forecast you cannot look backwards say reported cpi or pce personal consumption expenditures even this article here kinda gets it wrong you can take cpi as good measure for past changes price level what does cpi tell you about current rate of inflation though next nothing why it is because active government policy is needed sustain inflation inflation is not natural phenomenon if anything deflation is slightly more natural due more or less continual productivity gains due improved technology off-setting this is rampant consumerism greed of course another bias for pro-inflation is demand from lower paid for better equity when that is inflation driver then it is good thing not be complained about guess you can say human greed is natural but dont we are not greedy inherently we are not ruled deterministically by selfish genes tonnes of artificial incentives artificial scarcity make us greedy artificially competitive primarily excessive tax burden which mmt claims is overkill another cup of fresh mosler reading good article by freddie de boer on myths of elite attitudes education gaps quick for synopsis turns out is is also not about money nuance it is not about school funding top funded school systems have no inherently better performance for students outcomes gosh wonder why whats more poor black neighbourhood schools usa receive more funding poor student than all other classes of school yet no improvement outcomes for learners no surprises there but freddie thinks elites just refuse know facts think he is partly right turns out this known from new zealand research due prof roy nash long time ago what happens childs home is overwhelming importance so way de boer bit off money does matter but it has be seen terms of real resources relief for over-burdened parents free them up choose act wisely support their kids single mom working for living has no such choice funding her school hilt will have almost zero impact or near enough zero on her son or daughter or unicorn oh yeah what about warren had segment of text write-up about de boers article on ōhanga-pai substack full article is below see if you cna guess which bit had warren check proofread freddie $$ alfie this article by freddie de boer here is dynamite could hardly agree him more if someone whipped me love freddie stick going all way freddie alfie kohn might be stretch but hey two are tag team really alfie is unbeatable on problem gold stars rewards freddie gets money issue mostly right synopsis you can throw all money at education you like usa does it does not well correlate improved outcomes for students it is total myth usa schools are not well funded poor black neighbourhood schools are better funded per student so why persistent achievement gaps freddie mostly criticizes elites narrative correctly my view touches on proper solution one critical thing elites are blind is fact at home kids from wealthy households have far more resources which renders public school funding amount largely moot governments need fund families not just schools but wanted amplify bit on de boer correct some of his language framing first foremost funding for public schools is not your tax payer dollars mr de boer utterly fails realize he is parroting disgusting right-wing talking points tax payer dollars framing all public funding is currency created from nothing by government votes parliaments it is big part of annual currency injection from nowhere but keyboard at central bank that allows people pay tax what does this mean for correcting freddie’s piece it just means finding money is not problem there is always money if parliament votes spend by hiring teachers other resources at any wage rate moreover it re-gauges currency through relative price adjustments \u0026mdash more people might move into teaching jobs if pay relative office work is better but this cannot guarantee nor correlate much at all better poor income family student outcomes spend currency pay teachers hire resources for schools no tax payer needs be anywhere sight no one’s grandkids are held ransom someone at central bank merely credits someone’s bank account computer entry on government side of ledger no bond is needed currency can be booked as increase private bank reserves liability of government it is not first-order inflationary if government is paying going price not out-bidding private sector issue currency pay teachers hire resources for schools no tax payer needs be anywhere sight no one’s grand-kids are held ransom someone at central bank merely credits someone’s bank account computer entry on government side of ledger no bond is needed currency can be booked as increase private bank reserves liability of government it cannot be first-order inflationary if government is paying going price not out-bidding private sector freddie cocks it up when he criticizes elite’s normie meme if only funding right area if only funding spent wisely he says this is unfalsifiable if education outcomes do not improve elite policy wonk just retreats well you didn’t spend wisely true however this is not as vacuous as de boer makes out it is after all tautology so is true thing is add appropriate minimal real world complexity make it non-tautological therefore different statement which is testable hence informative mr de boer gives such standards they are obvious ones we need worry about how safe comfortable enriched intellectually but also enriched spiritually children teens are school but also at home at home research of prof roy nash as massey university critical showing this what happens at home is of huge over-riding importance but do not burden parents you policy wonks make sure parents have material means for living decent lives satisfied but do not try legislate for their moral behaviour that never works see research of samuel bowles for moral education people need be free make mistakes because that exercises their moral thinking critical thing is ensure parents or guardians have ample material needs satisfied for then temptation choose poor options e..g work overtime underpaid for shitty boss get income is minimized parents need be free of financial fear so they at least have option help their kids out lot like say hours day if kid wants help cooking nutritious \u0026amp tasty meal is learning help whether child knows it or not overwhelming evidence tells us students who love learning do well regardless of innate genetics or parenting or environment but these are highly correlated love learning it helps incredibly have supportive unburdened parents clean safe home safe school wise teacher all rest particular some decent nutritious food moving through your digestive system turns out that is linked brain who would know pffft mr de boer makes good point about lower decile straight out of based edwards deming no matter what you do there is always someone at bottom any ordinal ranking if they are living decent life are enfranchised then gap top level skilled people skill-level is irrelevant provided wage income gap is small which it can be made be moreover who ever proved high skill correlates high emotional spiritual capacity no study ever read but which people do value more am sure you can divine answer when want brain surgeon i’ll consent guy gal not who knows lot about brain surgery but particular guy gal who makes fewer mistakes fixes problem could care less about their bedside manner but who do spend most of time lovely nurses who look after patient pre post-surgery that’s who their skill is predominantly spiritual qualities not just fetching medicines changing bandages robot could probably do latter it is not hopeless policy wonks like complicate things beyond necessity but also end up simplistic policy what gives it is because they are viewing world through mainstream macroeconomics lens missing all humanity spirituality that cannot be seen school or even classroom but which is every child’s soul nourish soul practical terms that means also nourishing body all rest very last thing worry about is test scores if you want child or teen or adult master topic keep teaching helping until they master it test score can always be 100% or near enough if person does not wish master subject then why administer test if you fret about standards then test teacher but test teachers wisely don’t make them conform your artificial standards either so why is it not hopeless mr de boer gives answer nurturing learners is critical thing that’s just how human mind \u0026amp soul learns best particularly when student challenges themselves so test is inner reward is intrinsic mastery confidence fun of learning etc also renewed awareness of one’s relative ignorance hence hunger for more learning none of this is hopeless get going but it will exercise tiny brains of education policy wonk elites because them it seems insurmountable obstacles try craft policy force people enjoy learning policy wonks need re-education you cannot legislate for fun enjoyment of learning but what you can do is release teachers students from shackles of standardized testing extrinsic reward motives free them into wide open spaces of incredible fun of learning this end while free school movement is not perfect nor is home school movement both have valuable insights from their systems that can be incorporated into public schools ditch authority figure top-down lesson plans get students involved lesson planning guidance of humane teachers employ few more teacher aide workers lord knows there are plenty of unemployed people who can aide teachers without being hazard students finding money for wages recall is never problem bottom line from last comment is that yeah it does seem like intractable policy problem make schools fun for students so do not even try trust people given autonomy freedom within reasonable social constraints will find way make learning fun but imposing standardized tests upon them will sure as hell kill fun there are odd students who love tests exams who may even benefit therefrom my very own daughter one so… helllloooo give those students exams they can take their own sweet innocent time learn there is far more fun be had on this score had listen university professor complain that nzcea exams are not much use for him he wanted percentage scores stronger criteria too young at time critique sort of agreed him but now know better what’s frickin’ harm him giving prospective university enrollees his own screening test lazy dude he should not have rely on high schools too much of burden on his time would say it is university system problem university has ample time prepare select students who can be admitted they just don’t give themselves time they could choose give themselves time it will not kill anyone prematurely why is phd entrance exam any more necessary than freshman entrance exam if both are needed screen out ill-equipped prospective students then you should administer both if such entrance criteria are not needed then for goodness sake do not have entrance exam vast majority of cases they will not be needed since why is student enrolling if they do not want put effort into learning if student is enrolling earn credits then you know problem is imposed need earn credits so you need remove that motive make sure only reason student is enrolling your course is learn subject for whatever reason they have mind that case who should care whatever they qualify or not are they kind sincere human beings are they non-disruptive learning of others yes ok they qualify what if your resulting class size is too large omg dude why would you complain just told you that you do not have mark 1000 exam papers… unless you want torture yourself your students if you want earning credits be useful then dear university professor use umkc buckeroo system order receive their diploma each student must work 20 hours at course approved job out public or private sector or for charity one option could be demonstrate their mastery of subject you taught but out real world work place somewhere wait… what’s that you say there is no real world workplace where your course teaching is useful sheeesh don’t want go full utilitarian you never go full utilitarian ok so what if you teach some weird poetry or art or useless mathematics there is easy job such students could try out which is sell someone such art for government tax credits get 20 hours they could video their efforts could make for useful youtube comedy entertainment if they fail then it is no

opinion but warned of total catastrophe if people cannot unify sort out environmental social unrest problems he thought problems solvable but had no idea how had some things would like suggest gromov problems are not of mathematical or strictly economic nature they are spiritual all ills crises facing world at large are due roots lack of spirituality particular among leadership elites fact problems are spiritual nature does not make them easier solve but gromov worrying he had no analysis of root of problem therefore had no solution ideas offer well ive just told him root of all major problems be clear water degradation soil depletion ghg climate disruptions are not real problems they are drastic serious symptoms problems are spiritual no human being has any need be living like upper class american or chinese citizen it does no harm abundance of good have happy safe family living well below those levels of opulence once people recognize joy such humility we can easily solve

policy blunder caused residual employment simple policy mistake not market force if there are net savers around they need not be billionaires anyone who nets saves is forcing someone else net spend then government should be running deficit spending more than tax return otherwise government is by local accounting identity placing some people somewhere needless debt private bank interestingly some conservatives understood this very twisted way folks working for reagan bush knew government deficits necessary since by accounting identity government deficit is private sector surplus \u0026mdash while simultaneously blaming democrats for government deficits orwellian extreme \u0026mdash they just wanted most of surplus go top one percent not poor via hiring all unemployed tax liabilities created reagan right though still racist not want welfare queens but he disingenuous he could have made them all go away by hiring them all for public service decent meaningful jobs there is no end work needing done we wake up every day severe labour shortages but private sector will not hire unemployed they do not want them they want people already working so demand stimulus will usually just

their centre-right politics under such absence of currency spending constraint simple decency you can have society is from ethical political choices of how where spend tax credit into economy you want that be on poorest on real workers not financiers rentiers so you have stop basic income schemes for people who already have money proportion how much money they already have i.e stop issuing government bonds inject currency into economy instead by paying workers run meaningful social services which lower costs of doing business for firms also stop spending on m.i.c jobs except for legitimate collective defense work which means paying whole lot more sensible diplomats who are far cheaper than weapons know that government spending is not conditional upon tax receipts it is other way around entirely ability pay your taxes is dependent upon government net spending otherwise someone somewhere is needless terrible debt private bank by accounting identity how spiritual economics does hard lifting im exhausted just writing this little essay should be sufficient for today if you cannot figure out why spiritual virtues do all heavy lifting after mmt opens doors then cannot help you you need be able figure it out it is so obvious can just say that no matter how much government net spends if it all trickles up rentiers then someone somewhere is still unable pay their tax liabilities economics rents foisted upon them by rentier class so they are unemployed by definition but government has no spending constraint nominal inflation has nothing do this if real wage is rising does that suggest political policy choices might be best made spiritual lens meaning not ghosts new age crap but good old honesty wisdom honesty humility sense of justice kindness love for all

changing their tune now it is dis-inverted yield curve that signals recession moneytsarist haha psyche we knew this all along we only kidding before couldn’t you tell ooops big linguistic pun error when you think about it it is really mmt extremist who is moneytsarist mike then points out there no recession after yield curve inverted few years ago there will be none he then claims yield curve dis-inverting going back normal future yields higher than current yields is also not cause of recession but later on there might be recession say next year but it is because fed${}^\\dagger$ votes as committee lower interest rate that we get recession risk thus dis-inverted yield curve isolation means nothing since bond market is purely parasitic on real economy serves as nothing but regulator for interest-income people who already have money it also helps tighten torture apparatus screws on households who cannot avoid bank debt but thats another story because one regressive trickle-down way or another rich c_nts have get this income into pockets of middle class at least keep up sales right so if this trickle down fails gets clogged up by neoliberal brain excretions pipes then recession is very likely sales dropping off is always main damage spiral of lay-offs \u0026amp hence declining sales leading more lay-offs then epidemic-like nature of unemployment spreads like nasty virus ${}^\\dagger$ fed us central bank branch of government limited policy setting authority regulatory authority just had state it case any libertarians are reading short story then mike right or will be vindicated if things play out interest rate cuts absent fiscal policy adjustments keep demand steady as inferred though it is double edged sword rich c_nts lose interest-income but so what they already had money can still purchase whatever they need just less of it or yacht that doesnt have nsa cia gps only nasa gps poor get lower debt burden which is good but not as high wage growth which pay-off their past debt poorest always have past debt thats why they are poor negative scorepoints there is also initial impulse effect of asset revaluations whenever interest rate changes sharply but this is transient effect it causes market disruptions both ways so creates perturbation winners losers but interest rate story is not what most people think it is mmt alternative is just have permanent zero rate policy private money lenders can be permitted within non-fraudulent reason charge usury fee but mmt alternative is employ workers so they do not need borrow except if they want e.g buy house this is policy have not heard about mmt literature too much but warren mosler gets close it job guarantee idea is that basic decent income is government guaranteed is sufficient for any family live inclusively without stress that means it will always pay rent electricity groceries minimum plus bit save for vacation or whatever why is it not more prominent mmt literature answer is because recovering neoliberal mmters still fear inflation bogeyman keltonista look we cannot give poor too many scorepoints or they might eat too much then we will get horrors of inflaaaashhiooooon right stomach inflation not so good if regularly adjusting jg wage upwards causes bit of inflation then it is good thing you should never fear or cry about inflation if this is cause it would be reactionary right-wing thinking framing youve just improved peoples lives so friggin what if general price level went upwards it is gauge of scorekeeping system that policy improve peoples lives has just re-gauged or as bill mitchell once put it what do you prefer social pathologies of mass unemployment wasted human lives exceeding costs of all wars human history or scorepoints inflating suggest you prefer not be proxy mass murderer yield curve conventional so null concept is that yield curve charts cost government of borrowing more stupid regressive framing is not possible it is completely backwards first there is no cost government government matures all bonds by marking down treasuries account marking up check account there is no grandchild transported from future nor any taxpayer involved it literally cost $1$ minute of central bank clerks labour time second government cannot borrow its own iou at least not if it desires non-zero interest rate floor because over-night cash rate will head upwards if reserve drain selling bonds is not offset by reserve add government spending third government does not need sell bonds if policy is zero interest rate floor then government can always spend not sell bonds bonds are interest rate maintenance account not funding account as side-effect benefit only people who already have money fourth if government desired positive interest rate for whatever reason but there are no reasons when on floating exchange rate then they might still set effective interest rate floor zero but then tighten regulations on bank credit extension say by restricting policy on collateral regulatory requirements for issuance of those tax credits or increase credit risk regulations there are several other policy options am sure increase own price of currency aka interest rate secondary market personally do not think such policies are necessary more stable option is have your iou trade at par as base case lets try eliminate usury lets face it that is what it is when government chooses positive interest rate because although this privileges people who already have money its also means chartered banks will increase their interest rate since banks who are not at risk of asset devaluations are insensitive governments central bank rate they always operate on spread rate they are supposed always be insensitive by regulations but these are not well enforced remember svb bank another way put this is that floating exchange rate provides government greater fiscal policy space it allows central bank set permanent zero rate without psychological damage of nominal inflation fifth zero rate policy is not cheap money it is money at par cheap money is higher interest rate but it is only cheap money for people who already have money fact is is better than cheap it is free money for nothing except for being rich bravo lets reward you folks who have sucked up rents from poor can fry my eggs sarcasm that drips from my keyboard this is thing about interest rates they are not pure gauge because they are asymmetric for people who have money it is stimulus albeit highly regressive since it is all demand add for no supply add they do not need money for poorest it is crippling because they need credit just eat it does not have be this way non-zero interest rate policy is thus policy that generates changes winners losers positive interest rate acts as continual transfer from poor rich real terms what your whole income can purchase sixth there are other stories about other asset prices effected by changes interest rate policy but do not need write about all that it is mostly perturbation for investment class only rich c_unts exist that class have no moral obligation go bat for them they all should know risks of living system policy set regulations ignored by worm-brain neoliberal politicians central bankers governments should just pay pensioners decent healthy basic income euthanize investment class money managers \u0026mdash they are all parasitic overhead massive drain on real economy by investment class really only mean money managed accounts real investment real industry is good thing senventh why does yield curve invert then dis-invert ive given you answer it is because central bank votes set current interest rte floor if they vote it up then new bonds will have higher yield that is whole story almost if central bank thinks there is too much economic activity for good of those who like seeing workers suffer from unemployment then they think it is appropriate vote up interest rate \u0026mdash because they believe nullly most cases this cools down economy it doesnt. it is terrible policy response but that is their thinking that is why yield curve can invert conversely if they fear recession they vote lower interest rate because they think this lowering of cost of funds aka cheap money will help stimulate economy just pointed out this latter idea cheap money is null it is base case for trading currency at par it is most stable it is not cheap money it does not stimulate economy most cases especially not if currency is on float any case this vote will dis-invert yield curve if it previously inverted whether feared recession ever happens is anyones guess but backwards policy response is sick self-fulfilling prophecy lower rates without any fiscal offset like reducing taxes will help cause recession drop sales \u0026mdash for goods that people need that can easily be produced \u0026mdash then spiral think had few more points make concerning treasury bond market operations that relate yield curve story but hopefully that is sufficient for now if you have questions or question my account feel free write me if you donate few government scorepoints into my bank account via kofi then might also write back apologize if got something wrong oh my goodness am selling indulgences of some kind lol psychological damages want overlap previous notes here at ōhanga pai comment upon reality that nominal inflation is not financial nor economic risk it is psychological risk it gets you voted out of office but there is another collateral damage because neoliberals do not understand monetary system their policy responses nominal inflation adjustments are almost always regressive this is what hurts poorest not inflation itself it is always inappropriate policy response hence my constant refrain lefties never fear inflation bogeyman it drives you towards regressive austerity polices do not do that instead make appropriate policy adjustments by stuffing pockets of lowest wage workers your scorepoints but only lowest waged would add do this until you just start feel like right-wing assassins are about mobilize but no more than that myself if supreme leader would go whole hog risk assassination just prove point point that honest workers getting paid more are never problem \u0026mdash unless they are backwards thinking miscreants who turn fascist because someone even more cretinous told them they should desire gold but cannot convert their scorepoints into certificates for gold bullion that is kept under ground is it transgression use word cretin these days cannot keep

one day core problem is capitalism writ large neoliberalism gutting of public good funding particular long standing null paradigms concerning macroeconomics hint public science services are not tax payer funded no one can get state currency pay dime tax until government first lends or spends governments do not spend using tax payer dollars there is no such thing all currency since antiquity is iou of authority church state temple palace etc so public funding is exact opposite of what tax payer rhetoric suggests continued all good science begins wisdom motive ongoing need of worker-scientists eat survive profit motive then takes over then enshittification ensues unless idea has competitor so core problem is string theory has few credible competitors that is saying something because string theory itself is rubbish as you say it is least bad rubbish if we want serious competitors we need give other thinkers salary do work but science is not lets fund right project business by definition you cannot know which ideas are going pan out so inherently good science is not capitalist enterprise it can never be pure capitalist except by sheer good luck so funding agencies need have waaaay more open minds.the key is public finance government cannot run out of its own iou aka tax credit aka dollars so can always pay wage for any science nerd perpetuity cost private sector is real cost of real resources mainly labour of that science nerd is no longer available private sector otherwise her wage is bid up but currency issuer government can always outbid private sector whether they should or not is question out-bidding is defined as price pressure it can become inflationary if it occurs across wide spectrum of economic sectors without increase currency withdrawal saving or tax returns state wishes claim real resources not its own i.o.u aka money thus state needs us need their otherwise worthless currency how do they force us need it they impose tax liabilities most people running governments have no clue this is what they are doing how does that compare brain rot of extra space dimensions tax return is redemption operation not funding operation once you understand this you realize leaving good scientists unemployed is simple tragic policy mistake government is source of all unemployment defined as people seeking exchange their goods or labour for tax credit why do governments needlessly leave massive numbers of people unemployed typically 6% 10% of able workforce 20% 40% some countries drastically underemployed it is banal evil governments do not understand purpose of their own monetary system it is massive waste of human lives real cost of lost output from unemployment decade today exceeds real costs of all wars all

once you start trying be friends dumb-dumb marxists by saying state currency can be commodity or has ever been commodity you feed right-wing trolls who want return gold standard which is not gold currency it is currency peg big difference let’s not even feed these trolls although bill doesnt know me from adam am internet pals grumbine appreciate his efforts at real progressive more than any other podcast or public education platform world so theres that if fire at them it is intended as constructive criticism am not even angry bill just depressed also fully realize court of leftiepol public opinion am probably bad guy here no one wants know state currency is simple public monopoly has never all history been commodity currency no one on marxist left wants know marx analysis of falling rate of profit is myth although one socialist youtuber got it right agreement when pointed this out real falling rate of profit is simply ecological pressure so yeah capitalism eventually leads declining rate of growth of profit real terms that’s not even controversial it does not mean profits reverse it does not mean nominal profits won’t increase forever it means rate of accumulation of real profit slows rich still get richer forever if we do not actively dismantle injustices energy sapping excesses of rapacious capitalism if we do dismantle excesses of capitalism rich may still get forever richer fixing ecological crises can under some scenarios dystopian enhance power of rich there is no historical materialist law that dictates it will happen justly without active agitation pressure on governments change policy but if ecological systems are stressed enough that social pressure is inevitable or we die logic bro out is bite bullet yeah w̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ some of you’s will die lol am not even being edgy here am merely being highly autistic since thats what am am not out generate clicks likes or followers so take all that write at face value assess it for yourself if it is useful alternative framing fake mmt marxism then thats good it does not detract one iota from bills more important messaging working class get their lives needlessly ruined under capitalist modes of production thats just fact as ive written before you do not have be ideological socialist or marxist or right-wing edge lord know capitalism is unjust system has go nope money has never been commodity this is tad too simplistic but define commodity as something that gets consumed or degraded for use production gold is commodity because when used production it very slowly disintegrates time scale is so slow that it looks like mere intermediate but you cannot run space technology radiation shielding without microscopic loss of gold atoms without limiting use of gold for other technology such properties never apply unit of account mere semantics you say say not by end of this essay hope you realize that it is class warfare against working class frame state monetary systems as ever having been commodity money there is no such thing money is always i.o.u of issuer wrote this comment @1000 whats happened bill you never concede null principle state money has never been commodity money not even marxs day it has always functioned as tax credit generalizing meaning of tax sufficiently but not so much that stealing plundering gold is tax lol guess he is trying simplify things so dumb-dumb marxist can listen without having aneurysm distinction is clear what does state currency redeem for it never for gold on paper currencies at some times could be swapped for gold certificates sometimes bullion but what currency exchanges for does not define currency what defines unit of account is what issuer ultimately promises redeem when they run out of gold they stop redeeming for gold always continue redeeming for tax liabilities if not they have ceased being government tax driven currency has always been ultimate you can say there have been eras where commodity peg has been used but that is very far from being literal commodity money on peg what you look at is still scorepoints your bank account not pile of gold think know what bill is trying do or part of it there is need get marxist-socialists fully on board mmt if for no other reason they tend be much nicer kinder people than right-wing maga commie crowd${}^\\dagger$ so you dont want piss them off by telling them marx idiot about monetary operations have no such qualms though dont think any band of marxist-socialists is going overthrow neoliberal capitalism though they may certainly help effort \u0026mdash once they understand basic monetary macroeconomics ${}^\\dagger$we desperately need nice kind people leftiepol spaces who are not bashing garden variety working class stiff over head pseudo-woke carry-on intersectionality is good there is no decent social justice without working class justice had add this btw regard proper tax driven currency story as proper true story truth matters so you can placate aggressive marxist socialist as much as you like by discussing commodity pegs have no problem that but you are anti-socialist anti-worker if you peddle null narrative of pure commodity currency even small localities or feudal cliques where people literally transported metals or grains or whatever around intermediate trading of goods it still not commodity currency it fancy poker chip everyone understood debt credit relation which is scorepoint accounting unit relation dont make up white lies placate lefties you do not need if they are good honest kind people theyll sooner rather than later grok mmt if they are not honest wise then theres no point fibbing them make them happier about mmt realpolitik notwithstanding this is also why tyt network pivot alt-right is not going help they may gain some right-wing rich funders help propagate pseudo class conscious plebian right-wing sympathy for working class bernie-crat style politics lot on right-wing favour medicare for all for instance but as long as they think they need get currency pay for it off billionaires they will fail their ultimate efforts actually get such policy through government government representatives no longer call them leaders since thats just plain null will not vote pass higher government investment if they think they have tax rich pay for it you need tell these assholes whom unwashed masses keep voting into office that increased government spending will make rich people richer nominal terms but its ok leave that bit out you need tell lefties pseudo-woke liberals that increased government spending will also make poor people richer too real terms if not sadly also nominal terms then we can start getting work on reducing excess purchasing power billionaire investor class have are not using we do not need tax it all off them but just motivate them spend rets of scorepoints if you do not spend we will tax how by running ever higher government deficits fill spending gap evidence for which is unemployment seventh of deadly innocent frauds increased deficits today means higher taxes tomorrow myth being that this is bad thing when fact is that it is good thing do we need mention time is short on getting work on this because when it is over work is not yet done when that heavy lifting is done we can get work starting avoid ecological catastrophes like avoid people blaming mmt on shut down of amoc let me be clear capitalism is not money \u0026amp markets\u0026quot money \u0026amp markets are good things capitalism qua marx is class relation few people are bosses who do not work eat majority are wage slaves who need beg for employment eat expanded public sector services job guarantee totally different things eliminate capitalism qua marx we do not have do anything else destroy capitalism if state stands always ready hire you for public purpose at decent living wage then you are no longer begging for private sector employment youve undone capitalism relatively painless procedure that physician need not even issue sticking plaster for you can still work for boss if you like many will but it is now more voluntary private firm has make things pretty nice for you hire you out of public sector during your 9am 5pm although if public services are expanded non-bullshit then it is probably 11am 3pm more people honestly working less hours any one person needs work there may still be all sorts of other injustices here there like racism gender discrimination disability discrimination but lets deal those as well it is not lets deal them later die little inside every time see some youtube influencer ranting about threat of ai singularity like that is very least of problems see its fake problem one professional

bonds is not private wealth it represents it is that it is highly regressive since it amounts nothing but basic income but only for people who already have money proportion how much money they already

discussion about brics swift system sdrs other related issues of international currencies while purpose is good think few things are worth noting will be mainly making critique from dirtbag leftie perspective some folks who like concept of brics might not appreciate this but hope you read this offer corrections if you think any are needed short synopsis it does not matter what currency government is forced pay since there is always forex rate even for some of poorest nations issue is how make swap make payment not currency unit seller generally private sector agent motivated sell will most often make that exchange issue is fear of inflation but when has payment forced usd ever been inflationary cant see mechanism for inflation only because usd units are being demanded numeraires dont cause anything any case if exports are not strong then inflation can get passed through if more imports are desired government supports more imports at increasing rate it is rate of increase this case or import price hikes that mostly effects inflation but this case imported inflation is not weaponization of dollar but your weak economy demanding more than it can itself supply this falls under heading of deficiency of non resident savings desires if one be writing fed briefing lol usa can weaponize payments layers many ways it is through transport layer not currency unit e.g by refusing payments imposing preferential prices penalties blockades etc thats actual weaponization occurring thats proper case make for say brics transport system$^{}ddaggaer$ but youll need lot more than brics units proper un trade facilitation dismantling reforming wto be not neoliberal attack dog however us would have interfere payments between others for brics payments be benefit this is only significant for currency-users not currency-issuers so usa really have no power at all through payments layers cripple any nation they dont need do it that way nations get crippled by usa dollar hegemony only because they do not understand power \u0026amp purpose of their own existing currencies ultimately seller of us goods us bank account will receive usd but you cannot call this weaponization it is called desiring us bank account you say but what about pass through inflation ok but when has that ever crippled nation its all fear mongering source of inflation worry about is not coming from payments layer it comes from greed corruption which brics is not going fix brics will help moving where who more corrupt oligarchs live exploit it might be very good thing for usa

wisdom armed these spiritual tools working class can advance defeat oligarchy mmt adds critical knowledge component of wisdom $^{}ddagger$did someone just say one belt one road for global south

exploited workers like prostitutes came cry wrong we have protect all workers sex workers should not be even worrying about payments layer they use protection of all workers is not through payment layer also do not see any sex workers organizing underground movements overthrow oligarchs but if they are then great but payments layer they use for work is neither here nor there you know this strain mmt circles is really just same old colonization of peoples minds that austrian schoolers goldbugs have investing far too much hope for their ideological values currency systems it is same ubi crowd giant mind worms appeasing people scorepoints they did not have earn is fools gold parallel currency folks are doing things infinitely better \u0026mdash they understand purpose of tax-driven currency system running on top mini lesson it is deliberately create unemployment so state can then get rid of unemployment as long as state fails fill unemployment gap same as spending gap local parallel currency can always be successful eliminating local unemployment zero inflation pressure what mmt is very good at is clarifying ones perspective so that monetary system of accounts is least

reverse engineering flows of funds \u0026amp goods infer buyer identity but no currency can protect you from that spy craft do foreigners get forced pay for goods dollars answer no comment it is

payments systems \u0026mdash mainly forex desks or dealer banks or platforms like western union other \u0026mdash allow you pay for goods sold usd your scorepoints your bank account but even this misses point dollar is just numeraire anyone will accept your currency for payment issue is how much you must give them above fair exchange rate if you are black markets or dealing real piece of sh1t

placing hope freedom from us controlled payments systems us dollar hegemony both these are myth-making which while not directly lacking class conscious nevertheless seem on that verge do governments get forced pay for goods dollars answer no they can always pay their domestic currency what seller is going refuse sale if purpose simply prevent poor nation from getting goods that does not require some evil government control of swift system or anything else like it exporters just get told not ship no payments layer is sight think it is payments system or currency numeraire is have colonized

economists have things backwards as usual so government policy responses on both sides will likely be all screwed up too since for some godforsaken unknown reason politicians policy wonks still seem think credentialed economists have useful things say which 12 year old does not intuitively comprehend trying hurt trump country you will end up hurting your home country retaliation is for war prisoner’s dilemma not for trade ok that moslertron version long winded version here’s sober mmt breakdown of some of arguments around implications of tariffs government revenue sovereignty mmt posits that currency-sovereign government like usa which issues its own fiat currency usd does not need generate revenue through taxes or tariffs fund spending instead it can create money as needed constrained only by inflation risks from this perspective argument that tariffs raise revenue for u.s government is economically irrelevant under mmt because government does not require external funding operate instead tariffs act as policy tool other effects such as influencing trade flows or domestic production impact on importers consumers tariffs are effectively taxes on imports which are paid by u.s businesses importing goods not foreign exporters this raises costs for u.s importers who often pass these costs onto consumers form of higher prices this can lead inflationary pressures reduced purchasing power for households foreign exporters may respond by raising prices or diverting sales other markets minimizing their own economic harm thus burden of tariffs could disproportionately fall on u.s entities how disproportionate entirely depends on other country’s government policy response level of mmt awareness but you know… it could just end up misery all around hhow can write that because whole idea is increase government savings inapplicable notion when your government is issuer of currency it amounts demand withdrawal elsewhere key question is where is that else again that’ll be foreing governemtn policy response determination some economics think canada mexico will feel most of burden but this is null mmt perspective would say thatd be true only if mexican canadian government retaliate instead of using more appropriate mmt recommended fiscal adjustments if foreign entity marks prices upwards domestic currency can always be re-gauged this is not inflation it is one-time adjustment domestic prices that hurts no one wage has go up too all prices one-time adjustment fact it is good excuse for wise government boost low-end wages more pushing all prices upwards but from base if general price re-gauging is desired this is always better way implement gauging just you try stopping trickle-up youd need euthanize rentiers \u0026mdash which is much longer term project there are other policy responses too such as seeking other buyers for your exports governments of mexico canada can use some light subsidies help firms dependent on exporting if they so choose this can also help one-time price adjustment well-targeted fashion but real terms of trade are what are more important imports thus retaliation against usa by making u.s imports more expensive for your own economy is stupid policy response unfortunately this does not mean canada mexico will not go down stupid path remember it is not about jobs tariffs are never about jobs if tariffman resp tariffwoman wanted more jobs created usa resp mexico they could employ idle workers almost any industry probably even some executive orders if not congressional approval only is needed treasury fed resp central bank take marching orders from congress resp parliament they could even construct houses whole ghost cities for no one live sophisticated chinese version of keynes digging ditches fill them again they at least had something show for construction company grift central government can always employ anyone not employed by private sector without incurring inflationary pressures this is simply policy choice after first expanding public services if desired policy choice is then whether run unemployed labour buffer or fully employed labour buffer trade deficits real goods mmt views imports as net benefit because they provide real goods services exchange for financial claims currency that u.s as sovereign issuer of dollars can create at will conversely exports are seen as cost because they involve sending real resources abroad imposing tariffs reduces imports which mmt proponents argue harms u.s by limiting access these real goods while doing little benefit exporters who can find alternative markets this aligns critique that tariffs hurt u.s economy more than they help economic costs of tariffs most empirical analyses shows that tariffs reduce gdp growth employment investment long run for example proposed trump-era tariffs could shrink u.s gdp by up 1.3% cost over million full-time jobs if fully implemented tariffs also lead dollar appreciation making u.s exports less competitive globally further harming domestic producers reliant on international markets see global economist’s take on tariffs without complementary industrial policies boost domestic production tariffs alone fail achieve meaningful economic benefits while imposing significant costs on consumers businesses ibid conclusion recognize most of tumpo doctrines are just designed cause havoc no other rhyme nor reason is needed for them but you have ways avoid havoc if you have pleasure of living somewhere else have government powers from mmt perspective tariffs are counterproductive for currency-sovereign nation like u.s as they harm domestic consumers businesses while reducing access beneficial imports empirical data supports this view showing that tariffs depress economic growth employment without significantly benefiting domestic industries unless paired broader industrial strategies appropriate policy response of government feeling it’s exporters are going be hurt by tariffs imposed by tariffman is recognize your exporters have no place at any trade negotiation table on your end their interest is wealth of foreign buyers suppression of your domestic workers you can always ensure full non-ꕗꖹꝇꝇꕷꖾꕯꖡ employment have great standard of living there is always buyer for your stuff judicious fiscal adjustment can avoid all pain can avoid 100% of

thoroughly dirtbag thoroughly working class leftie as kevin mayes helpfully confirmed independently am not professional managerial class if you already know weimar story please skip next section main point of this essay is closer neoliberal empowerment of neo-nazis subthesis this one is not original plenty of mmters before me have pointed out that it versailles treaty which caused hyperinflation not weimar policy it imposed by french allies \u0026mdash as keynes predicted economic consequences of peace post ww-i hyperinflation result of war reparations but that put willies up next guy power chanceller brüning who scared 𖨚𖦙𖥣𖢧ꛚ𖠢𖨚𖨚 of inflation for no good reason imposed harsh needless austerity policies imposing debt gold on government that cannot be paid will always lead hyperinflation why because they cannot possibly be forced default they can always buy gold at cost of currency devaluation currency being numeraire can be endlessly devalued just stick extra zeroes on notes or issue more notes same thing this can continue indefinitely until actual source of inflation is removed this case war reparations shutdown of ruhr valley industries why austerity afterwards wasn’t deutschemark at time mmt system it but if you do not comprehend mmt your policies will likely be backwards if you also think neoclassical economics is correct then there is no doubt your policies will be backwards certainty but thing is they can always ensure their people have enough currency at new price level always problem is political disruption not financial side it becomes financial problem when government fails re-gauge by issuing more currency weimar government got it right they issued more currency by truckloads nevertheless it understandably highly disruptive currency issuance not cause of hyperinflation though it effect it also always hurts working class unemployed most when does their wage re-gauge answer is lot later on nevertheless truck-loads of deustschmark distributed correct policy under crushing gold denominated reparations debt french occupation of ruhr valley industrial area combined german worker strikes under imposed treaty war reparations german’s faced little other option but default on debt effect treaty of lausanne like default but negotiated really reversing stupid versailles treaty but damage already done because next guy power had become so fearful of hyperinflation for no good reason he imposed crushing austerity next guy power after that promised reverse austerity make germany great again rest is history as they say why austerity needless because germany had industrial power provide for all their people once ruhr valley industries got humming again reparations causing needless financial turmoil null inflation phobia hysteria psychology lifted while inflation stopped dead phobia did not because of this million+ jewish people savagely murdered holocaust inflation of numeraire currency is not financial problem not ever problem is political class war related misunderstanding of nature of weimar hyperinflation cause of null mindset that led austerity austerity clearly unjust many lumpen proletariat german this fueled hitler’s rise power aided by one of greatest ironies which plays out even today military keynesianism call john maynard keynes toff eugenicist all you like he at least understood peace preferable war that peace is not secured when victors fail forgive debts it is archetype of conservative mind not forgive debts conservatives tend think debt fair just how could it not be under glory of capitalism lol that’s big q.v cambridge controversy losing side there neoclassicals who believed labour gets just reward winners post-keynesians who showed labour is exploited neoclassicals conceded defeat history or really schools of economics if you can call them schools fake knowledge factories completely forgot who won see also why bright wise students do not want take economics courses neoliberal empowerment of neo-nazis if you are down this subthesis again you can skip real meat of this essay why ai boosters are nazi collaborators think can keep this one brief point of weimar story is that neoliberal austerity economics breeds working class resentment of elites this sometimes can lead significant working class support for fascists as we know fascist only need about solid 35% of demos support fascist becomes seen as their saviour you can bleat all day long about how this is stupid self-destructive it is but you cannot deny workers are correct seeking saviour when lampost is only light around you tend look for your keys under it or consider thomas franks what‘s matter kansas labour party greens liberal partisan organizations fake progressives have still not learned orthogonal arena of politics there is parallel climate ecosystem catastrophe when liberals demand end coal mining jobs such-like lower income workers will side their bosses all time yes know all more reason get rid of wage slavery but like it or not dont like it thats carts before horses only mmt can tell you why it never needs be jobs or environment but can very simple policy be protection of jobs \u0026amp environment by jobs mean fairly compensated spiritual endeavour worthwhile engagement crafts trades professions not wage slavery not put too fine point it neoliberalism is precursor fascism we would not have trump without reagan on through obama we would not have luxon \u0026amp willis without douglas richardson on through adern \u0026amp robertson maybe you do not regard luxon \u0026amp willis seymour as fascist but their government over-reach is not classic neoliberalism so it is pretty much fusion neolib-techno-fascist menu it is almost worse than fascism it is techno-fascism extreme rentier-ism without military keynesianism support we should just invent fake war increase our employment rate that joke but not altogether comedic intent did just offend any neolib snowflake sensibilities apologies if did remember only tech-nerds are required continue reading under my substack mk-ultra experiment here you will continue reading or your brain will explode you will continue reading or your brain will explode you will continue reading or your brain will explode why ai boosters are nazi collaborators this is uncomfortable bit why because know lot of tech enthusiasts see themselves as righteous libertarians freeing masses all that rubbish am telling them you are nazi collaborators so… massive dissonance cognitive have you young skywalker youd think id better back-up my case oodles of irrefutable data correlation versus causal analysis but cant do not get funded for any of this have huge piles of other research needing attention \u0026mdash which is also friggin unfunded so excuse me if venture opinion that aint funded by any donations besides my spiritual economics book you do not always need data if you have base marble moral reasoning data is good have benefit of spiritual arguments is that both liberals conservatives can accept them only brain-dead zombies or psychopaths would not accept spiritual argument${^\\ddagger}$ ${^\\ddagger}$and people who do not believe free will but theyre zombies so stating that would be redundant there is subtlety here too people may not believe free will but want believe do not begrudge that person \u0026mdash all they need do is admit their beliefs might be wrong people who do not want believe free will are nazi collaborators spiritual trumps empirical which is echo physics goat albert einstein if my theory had been wrong then would have been sorry for dear lord that is say if your moral reasoning is good empirical data will validate or empirical data is wrong of course ones moral reasoning may be stupid so not good which case there is good reason revert data but how do you know your moral reasoning good answer is that you do not know for sure but sincere motive purity of heart you can still give moral argument myself would then get empirical data back-up my claims but that costs lot of time energy thats my problem some things are too urgent for time lag today message is too urgent wait for data this case audience has take it all as cautionary tale so here it is short tai che forms spiritual frame now denying inherent spiritual nature of humans all other sentient beings is not only unscientific but morally reprehensible it is unscientific because science has nothing tell us about subjective consciousness science can only study what is objective on whose authority is \u0026lsquodenial of spirit morally reprehensible you might ask you can surely figure this out for yourself there are many sources but just consider what is source of all our moral reasoning faculties first place these are purely platonic abstract concepts more universal timeless than anything physical or man-made if you want something more concrete then just consider universal mathematical theorems start from mathematics realize it is not man-made nor social construct go from there symbols language forms we use communicate mathematics is socially constructed platonic mathematical ideas are not postmodernism is evil plague there is no absolute evil only some things less good than others but postmodernism is way down list of goods wrote this short firm for tech nerds because nerds are

think too much worry about vote but for this article will restrict normative use of elected representative id like thank ghostonthehalfshell for some inspiration question is what can local councils regional councils do when central government restricts their budget framing mmt local councils are not constrained by revenues tax receipts do not fund local government can they simply run local currency drive full employment prosperity you cannot be optimally prosperous single person unemployed level answer \u0026mdash are you agent of state far too many n00bie mmters suspect worry local councils depend on tax receipts but local councils are no different central government departments they are agents of central government no governments that know of ever spend directly as government tax payer is not funding local government because tax payers i.o.u is typically worthless local governments are funded by central government which is self-funding this is supposed be mmt-101 so hope jim byrne is reading which reminds me changed my mind think scotland is better place for mmt knowledge grow as well as samoa barbados since they have strong existential sort of need for independence so scottish people are primed for learning mmt like no others suspect what scottish national of sound mind would not like give westminster middle finger your whisky exports are real cost but this case

central government taxes local currency there is bank clearing obstacle here depending on institutional structure country some local councils might be able easily get around legalities others might not it can become political battle but my comment ghost this is one worth fighting losing is not fear not fighting is fear just by fighting issue is raised veils of neoliberal myths can be torn down obliterated even if we lose my guess is trouble is that local counsellors do not have courage because they want get re-elected they do not want lose their income so they are spineless gutless but would understand would be too if living comfortably had mortgage pay no wouldnt be so spineless but had stick that deflation so as not appear too rude level answer \u0026mdash courage we had local counsellor turn up for our local viewing of film finding money who said some local counsellor knew mmt but lacked power increase their budget told her they have power can use local currency drive full employment guess what happened even mmt bigwig academics stomped on me told me being unfair guess they are deaf dont know wellington we even have two names for currency ready for debate shake we get earthquakes hurricoin our rugby team are hurricanes cam up that one so it gets my vote but apart from name hardest thing rest is just local council policy implementation pretty easy know what you are thinking never underestimate power of bureaucratic deep state spill ball we could start list of things theyll say avoid implementation but thatd be too depressing worst thing is imagine they eventually see local currency working another region driving significant increase prosperity there what will they think oh my idiot obstinance bureaucratic conservatism lost us four years of real output that can never be recovered yeah right however there are local currencies operating around world few not too many but they are success stories we even have one system new zealand wairarapa green dollars or lets system been running since 1991 greatest success is they exist so no fussy bureaucrat here complaining local currency would be too much bureaucracy has leg stand on can you taste

need local currencies central government can always allow local government have overdraft facility purpose is full employment not money supply finagleling but while central government is run by

imperialism recently \u0026mdash you know because leftist hair-on-fire types annoy me about as much as blithering idiot neocons or perhaps it is just consuming too much of my news clippings from social media commentators is catching too much anti-establishment fluff old daily news fishing net anyway what you hear often from steady stream of anti-establishment types who range widely on political spectrum from extreme left-wing libertarian right-wing is that us empire is about collapse it is cringe stuff big whimpers empires do not just go away like this popular conception or lets say conception that thought-was-popular-but-only-in-my-own-head-since- i-do-not-pay-much-attention-to-what-most-people-understand-of-history-of-empire you know that sort of garden variety uncomplicated conception but take soviet union for example system of governance collapsed but russian state did not it split up but hardly collapse of russia what matters is people not system of government same oligarchs held on power russia who existed former soviet union hardly collapse of anything but ok it massive shock administratively doubt anything similar will occur for usa but if there is massive re-organization of government usa it will not vanquish might of usa that has not already been diminished it might even strengthen usa who knows key will be excise unholy madness of trumpistas if they burn-out establishment might be back but perhaps humbler ambitions for billionaires greater ambitions for working class well one can dream did hear whisper somewhere recently that some former obamarites have grown conscience but yes am already looking ahead of trump\u0026ndashmarsking reign think it will be clownish shortest monarchy world history holding real power will still be oligarchs when mar-a-lago bulldozer dust settles also really could not care if usa gets split up into several sovereign states that could be very good thing for some horrid for others but balance of break-up effect is impossible guess or even if there will be break my feeling from working usa is that ordinary people of usa have strong enough cultural identity can remain united power they are not united under vision of themselves as complete imperialist economic colonial 𖧥𖨚𖨚𖦙𖥕ꛚ𖠢s but they do share national multicultural identity that is richer than they might give themselves credit for collectively because cult of individual is also strong most people usa do not want this status as international pariahs neo-imperialists if government of usa listens their people all should be fine thats enough crystal ball gazing suck at it using timestone called history book wandering back centuries reading that my dopey naïve thought that big grand stories of collapses of empires bit mythical largely true while great leader is often man mounted on house of cards people of empire are more resilient than names at top tend always persist how could they not you cannot exterminate or assassinate culture some dude said it t.s eliot world ends not bang but whimper such seems be way great empires get rolled up time span historical accounts seems compressed when you read it but taking sober look at dates involved process tends for most empires which fade be very slow not soviet union style at all it is remarkable russians did it twice century if you consider soviets have been pretty empirical physics nerd puns are worst although do not know much about tsarist regime think from accounts ive read about bolshevik revolution that tsar pretty darn weak end well before revolution so this had been slow decline too good history work detailing rise fall of empires recommended by burning archive host jeff rich is john darwins after tamerlane it confirms what had always thought fishy although be honest have little time or pleasure read history so it is possible it my null impression of history as taught that at fault perhaps all scholars would say yeah empires never really collapse like that history buffs buffing up metals there are two things want comment upon now accounts of historians get money story wrong believe they talk about fiscal crises but are not giving us more accurate historical account for usa today collapse or reform of us government will not necessarily be collapse through collapse of us dollar am going take safavid persians indian moguls as my study for first orthodox history buff idea is that rulers needed collect revenue \u0026mdash order get their own currency complete bollocks why do history buffs who are supposed be excellent words not understand meaning of word revenue far more realistic account of empire collapse or retreat is that they get over-extended run out of real resources support army or mercenaries or whoever sometimes peasants revolt too if they are sending high revenue burden back rulers but we know that revenue side of sorry peasants cannot create currency so when they are forced return it they lose spending power social fabric community cohesion is destroyed this is cohesion unity that truly maintains empire history books often tell this story skewed afterall we are not talking about just continual barbarian hoards one after another most empires are peaceful-like hey relative terms ok nasty brutish short is peaceful compared violent sadistic over-in-a-flash extensions of empire are always after more real resources minerals silk food sometimes yes sometimes also gold silver fine thing for decoratively equipping non-fighting army demanding gold silver elites are undermining their empire they are making peasant work ꕗꖹꝇꝇꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs but you know it can work for while safavid monetary system lets examine safavids then who supposedly had fiscal crisis or two reduction those revenues will sprinkle few links for history buffs during safavid era persia primary state currency ʿabbāsī named after shah ʿabbās 1581\u0026ndash1629 ʿabbāsī issued both silver gold tokens silver being more common form other denominations included šāhī moḥammadī tūmān as unit of account double entry book-keeping around safavid qaja administration not far off what we do today it is fair say that safavid currency partially tax-driven but not exclusively so several factors contributed demand for rulers currency lets run through them tax collection safavid state collected taxes its official currency which created consistent demand for it taxes levied on land trade various economic activities requiring subjects acquire states currency meet their obligations lo basic mmt administrative payments high safavid officials paid salaries entitlements often through land grants toyūl special tax assessments which likely denominated state currency trade commerce ʿabbāsī other safavid coins used domestic international trade creating additional demand beyond tax purposes lo non-government sector also desires save tax credits minting control safavid rulers maintained control over minting farming out mint private persons who obliged bring foreign money public mint thus ensuring circulation of state currency this is mmt system if ever saw one periodic reforms such as those implemented by shah ʿabbās aimed standardize currency system increase its use throughout empire on point it clear protection of trade routes main problem not revenues its important note that foreign currencies also circulated rixdollars spanish ryals other foreign coins accepted often converted ʿabbāsīs lo behold forex desk operation it might have been floating exchange rate fact what else could it have been safavids did not sem have proper fixed exchange rate control from what can tell mmt just keeps piling on different regions within safavid empire used various currencies such as akçe shirvan tanka mazandaran before monetary unification efforts 1570s towards end of safavid period state faced economic difficulties including currency devaluation shortages of silver which affected stability demand for official currency which is indication even back then economists did not grasp function of state empire currency authority thus while tax collection significant driver of demand for safavid currency it part of broader economic system that included trade administrative payments sometimes backwards monetary policies all of which contributed currencys use circulation but also unnecessary fiscal crises point is though it still mmt taxes drove demand for currency devaluation not silver supply problem it problem of lack of understanding probably all around but certainly among elites of tax system when whole system effect gets mentally locked-in everyone thinks silver literally is money then bad things will result moghuls similar story can be told under reign of great ahkbar across india what is now pakistan however it appears their goldbug mentality more severe than safavids they really did believe metallic purity of coinages so it is no wonder they suffered needless fiscal crises it clearly mmt system akbar replaced previous tribute system monetary tax system based on uniform currency doubt pure tribute systems real goods given ever function for any large disparate empire scaling is all wrong but do not know it just seems impossible moghals did attempt manage relationship between face value intrinsic value for example ratio of dam copper coin rupee fluctuated over time from 481 at start of akbars reign 381 17th century eventually 161 by 1660s this suggests awareness of changing metal values attempts adjust accordingly but this is more like managing commodity peg they needed metal resources manage peg it madness but obviously people of day did not realize peasant communities they conquered probably functioning more like pure communists records of account all their heads so when coins came along from ahkbar they not wise scam so-to-speak someone somewhere digging up metals put into numeraire support null consciousness where these first ever truly ꕗꖹꝇꝇꕷꖾꕯꖡ jobs history apart from courtesan stuff once metallic value exceeds coin face value there is inevitable defacing et cetera so moghul system cannot truly have been metal standard metal intrinsic value had have been impediment trade efficiency would think not bonus it means people think they desire metal coin but if face value is higher metal is irrelevant fact big waste inefficiency indeed it is inherent instability did moghuls perhaps not realize this seems so it is interesting note wikipedia article stating misunderstanding openly naked base of empires collective wealth agricultural taxes instituted by third mughal emperor akbar these taxes which amounted well over half output of peasant cultivator paid well-regulated silver currency caused peasants artisans enter larger markets history goldbuffer dude where dd merchants get tokens from first place out their mint 𖧥𖨚𖨚𖠢𖨚 now it is possible ahkbar had some merchants mint coins themselves but this is not clear highly doubt it administration known high repute for excellent standardization which means officials likely closely controlled minting no one could get reap of rupee until empire spent it it is tragic you have mmt system but do not know it how much historic tragedy are we talking about now it is not just 20th century neoliberalism causing collapse crisis unemployment history records fiscal crisis but it not lack of tax revenue that problem that symptom problem over-extending empire need protect trade routes because of overwhelming demand for real resources available requiring extra metal resources for coins terrible mistake shoulda used tally sticks mr ahkbar when real supply is pressured revenues collapse tax revenue is ex poste accounting evidence of strong productive economy it is not funds for empire suspect there are very few history books that state this explicitly which is great shame although like wrote am not history buff so have not read widely enough say for certain buffs are still buffering fake knowledge of metals money also end this bit because rulers probably nullly believed metal money they probably caused fiscal crises needlessly or it still would say over-extended need for real resources likely loss of control over corruption is what devalues currency if ruler authority does not issue more tokens satisfy rise nominal demand i.e fails accommodate inflation then bad things are bound happen all more so if pegging metal standard lesson for history youd better know what you are standardizing for if you are ruler you always accommodate inflation meanwhile get army work shoring up supply which is cause not plundering but building you do not want real supply efforts be digging around for metals for stamped coin we cannot ever underestimate stupidity of ruler elites their material greed throughout history they are often their own undoing empires they inherit go out mostly whimpers usa today it is almost absurd think usa will collapse due

degree of wishful fantasy assuming neoliberals do not set out at gun be cruel stupid they only evolve that way lets be generous because they have no clue system they govern is mmt system one of big

away they are exposed wrath of masses like never before occupy movement never peeled away whole mask since would hazard guess 90% of occupy movement protesters we gotta raise taxes pay for it other words league maggie thatcher what is real take-away it is mmt supports any system you have if mmt is currency framework there is nothing pro-marx nor anti-worker nor propping up capitalism nor woke nor anti-woke about mmt unless you agree be woke means desire accurate framework for analysis of soft currencies hard commodities mmt systems have existed for thousands of years there is important spiritual principle here truth honesty before that desire seek truth is spiritual virtue regardless of any practical benefits which normally also accrue it is not hard see that trying do away mmt is moral hazard what do you plan replace currency system how do you know it will be any better social outcomes can you even have moneyless economy answer that last question is no any community where there are records of social obligations you have money system it might not be formalized so unit of account is vague only realized peoples memories large enough city that becomes unsustainable account ledgers are needed \u0026mdash not drive capitalism or markets but for simple justice spiritual virtue further point ponder is what fatal flaw of mmt systems make system work so horribly no one truly knows so you cannot just stick mmt knowledge up as strawman tell me we must abandon soft currencies because they do no good you first have show us that people power understand they are charge of mmt system if they are then well even then you cannot make argument social ills deriving from monetary poverty or financial instability are fault of mmt even this hypothetical scenario would still say problem is policy lack of spiritual principles mmt is only accounting system available governments it is neither good nor bad all moral ad value attributions are what people impose exogenously that is where all teh problems arise they would be same problems under any arrangement of records of account or so will claim can you prove otherwise what does peg gold get you other than constant deflations debt crises massive benefiting of super rich pirates most gluten is not free it costs worker their labour produce gluten-free anything point here being governments can always provide for free lunch programs school it need cost tax payer nothing nothing however nothing is free sun soil do not just grow food for us real cost of free school lunches is labour of workers by being employed by state they are not free be working doing something else what else who can know but are they going voluntarily still help out kids lower income district schools or anything more valuable for society but again this is nether good thing nor bad thing for many schools free lunch programs are good thing so there is good government policy option here provided workers making lunches could not be doing more useful things for society could they that is question ask not where is wage bill coming form if not me taxes this did not segue where wished end but will go end anyway it is another issue people seem have mmt which has nothing do mmt some folks are out their claiming something along lines of oh mmt is silly it says we cna have free stuff but this is only going create hyperinflation maybe ive constructed starwman here but swear ive heard this many times my response is that government cannot spend on anything not already for sale they can outbid other buyers always vote parliament but why would they lesson of teh austerity years is that almost all governments are dead scared of spending too much except for war artificial fiscal constraints are always removed for war spending anyway or have you been living under rock all these years there is no point therefore constraining governments artificially let them know they can always employ all unemployed people always if there are artificial constraints then dollars donuts neoliberal type mind will use it as null excuse keep poor poor least powerful workers unemployed \u0026mdash discipline inflation while more evil things do occur nothing could be more banal evil than this \u0026mdash for dirtbag mmter if you honestly believe unemployment is better have than inflation then am afraid lessons of history are dead against you your burden is show me full employment implies any amount of inflation whatsoever you cannot employment is never source of inflation besides all that maybe subtle point find incredibly too few grasp deflation is far worse for poor it raises burden of their past debt disproportionately benefits hoarders this is not argument for letting inflation rip there are political psychology reasons why governments should also use price stabilization polices like taxes on rents especially land progressive income tax \u0026mdash why because inflation for no sound reason except null psychology can get otherwise good government voted out of office for some mad reason bordering on mass psychopathy people seem prefer unemployment inflation can anyone tell me why truly do not know is it just greed outrageous cruel incentives governments impose forcing people generate insatiable savings desires it is worse than this though full employment is not linked inflation except via misguided policy another banality of evil fear of inflation is legit for hoarders but they are wrong that it implies quell their fear they since they are always elites must discipline workers should elaborate but this is longer story of nairu myth which is for another day is this all too materialistic for you then let me finish on spiritual note another thing mmt reveals is that source of all unemployment today do not care about past eras or unusual systems is government governments today cause all unemployment people seeking tax credit if you do not like that thought you can instead say plutocrats oligarchs today are causing all unemployment would agree since they are ones who control our governments one way or another they are either many of politicians or influencers lobbyists who push certain politicians upon our government governments are damaging people austerity policies not just material terms but spiritually as well if youve never been unemployed for decent stretch of time guess can see why you do not understand but it kills people inside well before actual physical death it is immoral for this be happening but perhaps thing be forgiven since people running our governments are so

monetary system theyre already governing who know where that could end huh its not like finally knowing actual rules of game being played does anyone playing honestly any harm what is for certain is that combination of more renewable energy supplies cutting back on energy rate power usage can achieve global limits we should desire working within planetary doughnut boundary think this case for eneergy conservation cut-back is not even controversial but econoists think they need endless growth support creidt money economy i.e never-ending profits this is null conception based ona fasle understanding of state currency system once mmt removes those veils we realize no one need be starved of currency just order limit energy output rate over time energy output rate story can be decoupled from currency austerity story but only if one comprehends mmt system governments can never run out of their own tax credit end of that side of story then you can focus on real side of story which is do we really need all this production of total crap no we do not peaceful calm prosperous spiritually rich materially unimpoverished low energy use civilization ensues without this education

now dont get too alienated here can we get off oil answer no we cannot we need oil for chemical feedstocks vital for modern life global south should not be deprived of such development pathways that we all enjoyed or at least boomers did but we can certainly afford stop burning fossil fuels big oil does not need be big pollution we cannot afford not invest renewables real answer here though is that we simply cannot afford continue burning fossil fuels pumping out concrete crypotocurrency chatbot server farm crud other noxious emissions real cost not monetary cost real cost of failure invest renewable energy energy conservation efforts today will be massive real costs future far exceeding real cost us today of making investments we are talking about real costs not monetary costs relevant costs for government only real stuff that is moving labour output towards green energy infrastructure rather than nice television opera cosmetic vanities fashion accessories but reality we probably do not need sacrifice performance of single opera effort build renewable energy resources is not all that overwhelming it just takes bit of time do not fall for prof steve keen myth that we lack minerals we do not lack minerals that idea is premised on assumption we have keep increasing energy output rate truth we do not we already over-produce cutting back on energy rate of consumption is not going lower median standard of living at all just think of all enormous amount of crap you buy that you never needed including that second smartphone quit buying that stuff you do not need it true investment it constantly surprises me so many capitalistic minded so-called investors fail grasp all this wish just leave things up so-called free markets sort out these idiots are fake investors they forgot meaning of term invest you know damn well why too because these bastards investment means monetary returns whereas ethical investor is always seeking real returns not monetary returns people who seek monetary returns are net anti-investors clearly by definition they are savers they are ones who reduce currency circulation force government run more massive deficits they are promoters of austerity because no matter what circulation their investments generate fact they net save means someone else has be spending more than their income dollars donuts that is some low paid worker who can ill afford slide further into bank debt but it doesnt have be that way because government can fact run large deficits perpetuity thereby prevent lowest income families from suffering bank debt it is all about where government net spending ends up problem being it is not going those who need it it is good we have government deficits but very not good who it all gets channelled towards our present era of gross neoliberal class war macroeconomics wrong idea market investment only works via profit motive if returns can be realized short run but returns investment renewable energy technology are far future they are returns of not suffering massive ecological collapse this is true whether you believe science that millions will lose their communities due sea level rise millions may die of wet bulb conditions millions will starve from subsequent agricultural production collapse these wet bulb regions this is before we start talking about possible desertification or ocean amoc atlantic meridional overturning circulation collapse these tipping points might be mere possibilities not inevitability but fact they have non-zero probability of occurring is reason invest renewables mitigation even if possible reversal of our rate of energy consumption question can this be achieved without job losses mass unemployment answer yes of course government is source of all unemployment has sole authority eliminate all unemployment it creates jobs will be lost some industries but without unemployment if people need employment then there are endless good things they can do for their community pleasant things far better than digging up coal or burying nuclear waste government can always pay these wages without questionwithout inflation bias much greater fair compensation than welfare hand-out as most macroeconomic issues it is always about government willingness spend not capacity spend they have infinite capacity spend for government policy then focus has be on real costs of failure spend not on money amount money amount is utterly irrelevant if you are monopoly creator of currency question can invisible hand of market turn big oil or any other industry into non-polluter answer would say no evidence is overwhelming that government regulation is absolutely necessary any case every mmt aware person knows government creates entire market first place for goods prices denominated states unit of account doubt we will be transitioning pastoral life styles local currencies without central governments any time soon although that utopia appealing me have be realistic im not asking you be realistic im self-imposing realism austerity on myself ok besides if we did soon transition simple pastoral lifestyles that would imply in-between times millions of people have died it is accelerationist scenario youd need total collapse of systems destroy central government maybe this will come pass but im not fond of entertaining that scenario if you dont mind we can be more civilized yeah but you wont be more civilized if you have backwards understanding of monetary system if you nullly believe government must tax us create its own scorepoints at its own central bank does scorekeeper game of bridge or scrabble have get scorepoints off players first answer is no government does not get its own currency off tax payer when taxes are paid currency is destroyed all that remains is accounting record of redemption operation you extinguished some units of tax liability government did not get anything useful from this except accounting record these accounting records can of course be useful for some analysis purposes but really they are not terribly useful if we lost hard drives these records on them no one would starve or die right so finding money is never problem finding votes is problem catch-22 though we cannot find votes for green energy investments because people running our governments still idiotically believe government has get nzd scorepoints off tax payer or by borrowing from private banks who have no counterfeit capacity promised reader id talk about credit money some time but lets just make bookmark here that banks cannot fund anything they only get charter from state issue credit interest so that is net negative money however while that credit circulates it does promote more economic activity it is economic activity that is enhanced through commercial banking operations not net money supply that also needs grow for growing population only monopoly issuer of currency can create necessary growing money supply this is called government deficit spending but it is healthier refer it as net private savings or if you want be stock\u0026ndashflow consistent language it is net private income resource

bloody stupid mate thats technical jargon aussie can understand what steve is doing is conceding principle we cannot do this ill explain minute but first consider myself rebel economist too steve is very generous has his minsky software available free-libre gave me discount enrol his online skool.com rebel economist forum so im not criticizing him as person it merely language framing that objected but this is of vital importance steve may be about 80 years old but he is still capable of learning evolving case point he seems have finally woken up concept elon musk is not rescuing planet is no venture effective altruist you have wonder though dont you about friends of mmt who could not see how disgusting mr musk from start we are talking right from paypal days or perhaps since birth cutting chase what steve claims is that capitalism gave us diversity of stuff wonderful things you can stop right there since thats dead null unless by we you mean top ten percenters it is class unconscious garbage so cretinous it is also making classic mistake science of confusing correlation causation it is also being dopey ptolemaicist which ironically profkeen often decries against howso well it is because profkeen is basing his framing on wonky error ridden theoretical study by economist really need do whole essay on that load of bollocks some day kornais analysis is dead wrong not least because soviet model which he uses nothing even remotely close socialism soviet not even very good central planning kornai also uses lot of simplifying assumptions isnt that what profkeen warns against yes so dude mate you cant be talking out both sides of your mouth like this it does not look good destroys your credibility despite all good you do let me even quote from another stupid mmt economist michel hudson but this case hudson is quite right usa economy is also central planning central planners are wall street silicon valley that is of course so-to-speak not literally or you could say as-good-as-if think this would converge chomskys opinion as well it is being perversely pedantic insist otherwise newsflash all you dopey capitalism boosting mmters guys you do not have free market guys not adam smith sense anyhow what helped generate product diversity is economic market not capitalism markets have existed for perhaps over four thousand years although im not most well-read anthropologist though so please fact-check me on this but certainly well before state sponsored organized capitalism science technology but first of all science is what generated product diversity not markets science exists independent of political economy for science all you need is nerd or two you cannot suppress them they will work like unwitting slaves for peanuts because thrill

ideas will not spring except by accidental quantum fluctuations anyhow this brings me my main point today which almost forgot it partly prompted by this weird communist boomer heard on otherwise decent podcast avorkian or something he sounded like he wants modernize communism but he also went backwards into 19th century laplacian daemon dark ages because he trotted out old myth that communism is materialist scientific lordy you cannot get worse than this what hurts us most is not harm of our enemies but acts of our friends which cause our hearts lament not only is he spitting face of millions of decent honest workers who have religious or spiritual worldview are damn good socialists he is just being stupid null nasty communism \u0026mdash of that form \u0026mdash is not scientific bro what about my headline thesis well neoliberalism is underpinned by materialism it is contradictory because neoliberalism is based on idealist ideology but it is fake since it makes too many null assumptions about how markets operate about what money is so on so forth list of null propositions of neolberalism neoclassical economics is vast just like fighting terrorism critical power we have is remove underpinnings thus defeating materialism does more than defeat neoliberalism it makes neoliberal resurgence impossible well have removed their fuel just be clear am not idealist am theoretical physicist trust there is real external material world but just this is not sum total of reality electrons are real they are physical they do not exist just our minds also think integers rationals are real as well but just not physical on most days also think transfinite sets are real too clearly non-physical science proper is entirely agnostic on matters of religion spirituality see my recent rant

your-bare-bones-guide-to-monetaryr=3r8qc do not want trouble anyone much but drafted fairly stern reply jim wondered if it would be wise post openly decided maybe not it is more of mmt insider issue feel not desire for some sort of weird mmt purity but more for consistent language framing concept clarity always like concept clarity \u0026mdash again not for any hermetic purity reasons but for intellectual ease it troubles my head if have think too deeply about what may be otherwise simple concepts this happens awful lot theoretical physics so wrote jim telling him disagree respectfully fadhel always have money has nothing overtly do food energy so forth but does have something do state power \u0026amp authority he is redefining terms do not like his redefinition they are clouding some issues my view am punching up here massively note fadhel is one of credentialed elites am nobody feel need mention this because theres lot of confusion these days about academic respectability my position is that you have respect good peer reviewed research contemporary issue is what happens when peer review is bad who is peer reviewing peer reviewers this is question question is not as some cranks like sabine hossenfelder eric weinstein constantly whinge moan about that academia is rotten best research is still coming out of academia well equipped laboratories are they sincerely spiritually motivated though or just motivated by imposed need seek grant funds outside of stable salary block grants extent academics are motivated only by making monetary profit think their research should be distrusted at outset but this does not implicate all that much of academic research anyhow this is just say you need have no reason trust what write you should think things through for yourself be part of communal peer review this can on occasion be superior academic peer review but is not intrinsically superior nor is academic review intrinsically superior it is just mostly good sometimes bad mmt frame as see it currency is way get society going proper records of account robust public sector if government has this then they are monetary sovereign it blurs boundaries useful categorizations otherwise frame things way fadhel does do not even know what technological sovereignty means it sounds like made-up notion what community has ever all history had technology without reliance on foreign knowledge none as far as can tell except unrecorded stone-age isaac newton we stand on shoulders of giants having stated that it is indeed huge problem if nation is not energy food self-sufficient but theyre not going do any better than use mmt policy space wisely every well-formed country has legislative monetary sovereignty period it is good base start from saying full monetary sovereignty unless it has sovereignty over four key areas is definition is all think it is dopey what can agree is simply remove one word full sovereignty includes these four conditions you do not need drag money on top it is already first of four conditions so stating it as money sovereignty is \u0026mdash is redundant which reveals silliness of language framing way fadhel insists thing is it serves no useful framing he does not have insist nation lacks money sovereignty besides by moslers definitions fadhels is simply null whos definition do you prefer then prefer one that removes redundancy call it my theoretical physics bias it matters lot physics like difference between stability violent blow-up infinity not my definition of course fadhel is free go his definition but it would be dishonest call it mmt id thus advise against since it is somewhat de-powering food energy insufficiency can always be overcome good imports assistance from wealthier nations think this is fadhels point but he should lead it mmt isolation is not enough for isolated unsustainable nation but it is best nation can do domestically up policy choices full mmt policy space available nation is as sovereign as it can possibly be absent international relations like fadhel he does great work on developmental economics but think he is co-opting mmt here unhelpful way even mmt101 has stated mmt is just lens think we should stick that it is useful categorization compartmentalization while allowing for more holistic macroeconomic understandings talk warren \u0026amp bill about this this is just my personal opinion filtered through my highly autistic brain hopefully mosler \u0026amp mitchell can convince you if cannot full metal wrap maybe when all is said done for today just think talk about sovereignties is might too cute for my taste if final conclusions are same then guess should not care too much how much of convoluted garden path people like fadhel take get there maybe you just need write academic papers that are longer than few sentences justify your salary here is my academic paper for which had warren mosler seal of approval \u0026mdash fact almost stole these words off warren but he freely offered them up consider this \u0026lsquopyramid todays so-called civilized world none of us for all practical purposes is self-sufficient we \u0026lsquoimport food clothing shelter energy etc from others no village town or city is self-sufficient no state is self-sufficient no nation is self-sufficient we are all better off for it well-being is enhanced by expanding all this only thing gained by going backwards towards full self-sufficiency is security that only needs be done few limited resource areas imagined but not unrealistic proper united nations structure this security need can be incredibly minimal which saves effort among all nations reduces burden on necessary labour which is always dumped upon working class we need really eliminate that economic class divide all can be workers during able years of life we are all better off for it when youre dealing friends you minimize security risks so support making world safer by relying upon trade by relinquishing some limited sovereignty we will create better world this way.${}^\\dagger$ ${}^\\dagger$if tankies ultranationalists disagree then im going go well that only helps prove my case

analysing what system we have for now not some socialist or anarcho-syndicalist utopia ok but cannot say one-time depreciation is going have these nice outcomes policy implementation matters because of dynamical effects of hysteresis parry any government that has decent social policy love of their people can sustain inflation on infinity its book-keeping nuisance of course have firms constantly

either gesell currency \u0026mdash erodes purchasing power of government scorepoints by clear transparent policy design currency re-gauging by increasing lowest wage but that is all former is

mention two of them today does qe risk asset price inflation is bond market really good indicator of things macroeocnomic does qe risk asset price inflation answer is no you cannot force bond trader swap for cash they wont unless they see better investment vehicle but then why they trading or saving bonds cause of asset price inflation comes from other economic policy structure that cause is why savers want get out of bonds into equities they see dip real-estate market better real rate of return so will swap bonds for cash then cash for real estate or any other equities or commodities qe has nothing do it investors go into out of bonds all time exercising their savings preferences when central bank does qe do you think that matters at all dont think it matters if bankers are only ones cashing bonds then it matters even less since it then has zero effect on their lending capacity except at accounting prudential requirement margins qe increases bank reserves exchange settlement balances but these have no effect whatsoever on credit-worthiness of bank customers if anything they reduce credit-worthiness macro since now non-government sector has no juicy billions of dollars interest-income each month as fuel some countries central bank may now pay interest on excess reserves which can add bank capital but really we should just not have bankers business of equity asset investment they do not belong that space but any case that is still not going push up asset prices it is more often case that government austerity pushes up asset prices why because being starved of injections rentier sector will just raise their price until rent-payers scream for same reasons effective bid auctions on other assets goes into high rise mode relative price story is thus far more dynamical complicated than just qe putting more reserves into payments clearing layer also its rate of change income that matters not how much qe totalled so after qe event nothing else happens unless there is continued source of income fairly significant extent that source is government interest payments on bonds opposite of qe you should instead analyze all assets commodities separately since they are often totally separate stories real-estate its cabal of property evaluators mixing agents that help push up price its upper class snobs desires have second homes speculation market thereupon its whole mindset of house as asset it is not real savings vehicle since property depreciates real terms \u0026mdash this is why real estate price booms are always ponzi you cannot stamp out greed especially not when government policy is forcing people have insatiable savings desires really for no good reason qe has nothing much at all do all this greed meanwhile mary plumber joe hair-stylist are left just wanting house live but see ridiculous prices for this basic need it has nothing at all do qe it has everything do greed is bond market important answer is no not even under fixed exchange rates currency issuer does not need set non-zero interest rate commercial banks can be permitted by law charge interest or not islamic banking they do not nothing bad happens if you just love interest rates then go read derek mcdaniel at ratedisparity he is non-zirper disagree his rationale but if you want case be made no one know will make it better my case is maybe more complicated for people easily see but once you see it then its simple first under zirp non-government sector gets starved of basic income for people who already have money so this is good thing you do not want give it up by having positive interest rate policy unless you absolutely must fixed exchange rate could be reason but is not absolute must why not it is because degree of freedom that squirts out blows up when exports cannot help stabilize import price ratios is inflation but here blow up is emotive really incorrect so slap me on wrist what happens weak export economy is that import price rises can pass-through inflate domestic goods especially when energy or food is big import needed for domestic fuel there is thus one-time upwards adjustment price level when imports undergo jump this is not inflation though it is one-off adjustment or re-gauging but psychologically people it can appear like inflation so is politically undesirable ok but it cannot cause hyperinflation even hyperinflation is not blow up but thats metaphor people use it is designed scare it induces austerity thinking which crushes working classes always what can cause politically damaging inflation rises is when government indexes certain payments backwards as yesterday measure of price levle change this is feedback effect whenever government adopts fixed exchange rate or commodity peg it is not constraint when on floating exchange rate since exchange rate adjustment is first mover of preferences all government then needs do is make domestic policy adjustment ensure full employment so pass-through effect of import prices should be irrelevant it is not today irrelevant because government policy is backwards sense of having fixed exchange rate model now lets go back fixed exchange rate regime even then need for positive interest rate is not necessity if government has withdraw demand they can raise taxes but suppose they cannot find will do so then they also have option of offering savings bonds withdraw demand temporarily they have third option which is reduce spending austerity but this can become unstable it can spiral down until mass unemployment cripples real economy this case government has allowed spreadsheet issues bleed into real economy fixing exchange rate government is promising deliver currency it cannot create thus needs holding of foreign currency thus needs exporters get cracking because government tend not sell foreign buyers so tends have borrow foreign currency from banks relying on forex swaps repay if they cannot fundamentally repay thanks strong exports then forex swap puts pressure on currency maintain fixed exchange rate government will be forced cut spending or reduce domestic demand other ways raise taxes cause mass unemployment promise higher interest rate on their own currency all these things most probably if exports go south or merely if exports fail keep pace import demand such are woes of fixed exchange rate regimes commodity pegs 𐝥ꗍꖡꗇ𐝥ꕒꗍꕒ policy woes so why why be 𖦪𖠢𖢧𖧥𖦪𖦧𖠢𖦧 theres no need one alternative avoid mass unemployment austerity is just let inflation rate be what it needs be focus on full employment since you can do no better no one dies everyone eats well we can all go movies but people hate going movies eating well when their wages go up too fast they prefer their wages be pretty constant starve go figure thats only half sarcastic people do of course prefer prices remain stable its just our psychology heck even prefer knowing price year out will be about same as today it aids planning stuff but what do not like see is unemployment because that means people are suffering heck my prices do not care about prices when people are suffering if eliminate suffering we need wage inflation then we should have wage inflation forever full employment policy almost always increases real wage anyway thus we would all be better off what is not cool though is preference most people have developed or culturally learned prefer seeing other people unemployed rather than their prices wages go up its mental disease horrific consequences ok but letting inflation rate loose is good but still mildly 🅁𝘦𝘵🄰🅁𝙙𝙚🅓 it

surgical masks name just couple of exmaples of strategic resources domestic policy is critical you want people understand truth that domestic adjustments can always be made so poorer nation global south can net import without it turning into mass unemployment story or borrowing from imf story completely needless ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ because then fault of failure domestic economy i.e unemployemnt rising inequality is clear ordinary people can then put presusure on their government do right thing which is only possible when government no longer has excuses we cannot find our own scorepoints or ii but balance of payments constraint will risk hyperinflation once people know those myths are null ordinary people can pressure governments provide full decent quality social services full employment without having go private market for cheap \u0026amp nasty substitutes expensive healthcare free public healthcare is real cost not monetary cost its oposite of cost it is monetary injection into

injections but never enough eliminate unemployment why would centrist neoliberals eliminate unemployment no good reason huh since working class are no longer their base working class have no government representation at present not anywhere not even from lula brazil talk about taxation without representation its at obscene levels not seen since war of independence why is kiwi writing so much about usa hear you ask answer is because what usa does has poodles like nz neoliberals following fart streams anyway this post spit out my comments on ridiculous kyle kulinski fearstream be fair hes not wrong gop are screwing things up mightily but kulinskis reasoning still all backwards as hard as it is fathom my thinking is if he said it all correctly it would spell lot worse than his pronouncements because it is not going be crash it will just be more long suffering seemingly without end never let crisis go waste democrats will come into power spew we have suck it up tighten our belts thanks trumps gop blame them blame them for poor scorekeeping but not yourselves but yeah this time it could be different as acknowledged my last post we will see not before too long but even if temotpih fails create real crash rather than just financial crash it does not ever make pain felt by working families unemployed through no fault of their own any less horrific korrekting kulinski part-1 of couple of corrections kulinksi your economy is not yet crushed your farmers can still grow soybeans your trouble is us citizens do not want eat them all trade is about getting as many imports for as few exports as possible your exports are your real loss not your benefit chinese firms buying soybeans cannot make us$ fact they tend save us treasuries demand withdrawal which provides more fiscal space for us government spending problem is your government is not filling that currency vacuum evidence is unemployment read deficit myth \u0026mdash no mean actually read it this time your export farm lobby is really enemy of usa their interest is foreign buyer lower domestic wages farm policy should instead be 90% domestic feed your own people first not just soybeans grow some other crops whatever excess you produce there is always foreign buyer at some price e.g farm starved nations give them discount its humane thing do trade which is more often opposite of religion better receive than give part-2 foreign trade is not your problem fundamentally you trade get nice imports not export which fuels your export oligarchs enemies of nation their interest is suppressing domestic wages your problem is drying up of fiscal injections aka governemtn deficit thats what is killing you not excess soybeans grow other crops for domestic sale gov deficit is dollar-for-dollar non-government sector surplus you want that higher not lower if your population grows you want accumulated debt therefrom grow population size not shrink just support existing prices even before inflation from interest rate hikes interest rate is base inflation rate through term structure of prices faced by consumers contracts today while old hat mmt this stuff cannot be repeated often enough government debt is net money supply i.e non-government sector tax credits by accounting identity growing population is should naturally rise over time indefinitely it always can its just scorekeeping

of adolph reeds critique of magic marxism or reed 2025 scientific socialism did not find too many mmt critiques apply which is good but wanted amplify one point reed makes about use of word science by magic marxist socialist idea reed gives about what science means is think good science seeks identify physical reality being that which exists externally for all observers independent of observers consciousness short science is framework set of practices that is human conscious but which seeks remove human conscious what remains is referred as subject of science that note has nothing do reeds critique of magik marxism but is important contemporary topics associated debates about free will artificial consciousness for reeds thoughts reduced mmt-dimwit which is yours truly readability read onwards scientific marxism what reed critiques could be any fetishization of rationality logic political realm so it is not just magic marxists he is accusing of rank stupidity it is also neoliberal technocrats proper role of science my framework for anything human is spiritual but you could say moral do not like things that are mystical unless they are private do not come out for lunch at lunchtime need actual food this means basic ordinary spiritual morality all that means is being loving kind just wise compassionate honest also humble do not mean anything more than these attributes this set defines spirituality for me decent approximation you all know what counts what is maybe little grey what is definitely not set spiritual you know from deeds actions not from phonemes or letters or words this really reeds point real politics considers human spirit there is nicer way state all this without reeds academic jargon which is that science religion are not conflict never have been this is also baháʼí philosophy when science religion are not harmony then one or both are null modernist conceit is that which is at fault is religion thats not only dark loathsome prejudice of our times it is dangerous equally as dangerous as anti-religion masquerading as genuine religion which is just about all churches mosques temples seminaries whatnot world today you can however find genuine religion all over place hearts of decent people all more so when they are not church or temples but actually out world helping people out of gutter now you know that as philosophical principle you can use what you may believe be honestly valid science eliminate what is null religion christian fascism for example what really is origin of fascism it is not christianity it is anti-christianity loss of faith replacement of faith some creed like nationalism nation becomes sacred $\\sim$ anti-religion but you can also use what you may think be honestly valid religion eschew null science anti-vaxx activism anti-global warming propaganda technocracy authoritarianism worker exploitation but genuine spirituality is more power it is at least as powerful as science because like science it is self-correcting once your religious ideology turns fetid corrupt it will lead hatred violence then you know it is null bit like getting negative result experiment that your \u0026lsquoscience predicted would be positive there is another thing learned from baháʼí faith which is also something got from gödel science mathematics logic are incomplete so provide us exact knowledge but of very few things religion is complete but provides us within inexact knowledge yet of all things you can see how both are complementary work harmony when either science or religion becomes unthinking ideology it can quickly switch from being previously valid some context now null ask any electrician or home-body flipping switches can be dangerous activity especially when one is left \u0026lsquoon reed knows biz cannot critique this next bit but just applaud reed for getting it right he points out scientific socialists are not only nutters but probably dangerously so because what cannot be measured cannot be adjudicated by science problem is that intellectual systems frameworks are developed by human beings within society that extent those frameworks systems must reflect class reality of social order therefore since scientism as analytic frame of reference rather than merely number of research techniques is product of bourgeois society method itself must reflect biases of bourgeois social organization which is pretty good heady take on you cannot necessarily fix broken things using tools that did breaking political economy this translates you cannot depend upon goodwill of tory nor neoliberal because their goodwill is what worker sees as explicit ill-will actually this can even be measured so even scientific socialist might agree reed presents this as trichotomy science is bourgeois or science is suprahuman so mystical or science is pre-existing package we discover so is reified of course all three pertain how we go about things scientific various contexts but so do other aspects pertain like having great ball of fun mucking around laboratory or on abacus science is for me personally above all else playful inventiveness goal of which is hope be correct about world uncover hidden realities but not expect by any divine right of hard work or rule-following protestantism that you will be successful reed science cannot be absolutized if it is taken as product of given form of social knowledge therefore science cannot be considered form of knowledge but only particular form of knowledge 💯%🎯 take-away is that we by moral force should never absolutize science we cannot ever let science rule this is not purpose of science decent sloppy democratic society science is for dirtbags wonderful artistic pursuit beautiful empirical concrete results useful engineering useful keep nerd riff-raff fully employed once we reify or totalitarianize science as some monstrosity called technocracy or whatever or scientific socialism we are doomed moral failures brainrot for dirtbag science by very good nature has be explorative playful should never be rigidized or driven by rules norms those latter are death of science science good kind seeks uncover natures rules but by some pretty odd-ball non-rules means like this weird activity called 𝓭𝗼🅾𝗱𝚕𝖎ⓝ𝑔 \u0026amp 𝔱𝗵ⓘ𝓃𝑘𝒊𝙣🅶 which are equal parts mystical reified yes we do discover truths culturally filtered sometimes even crazy stupid not sort of minds you necessarily want government government we want moral minds not technocrats however placate you nerds-who-want-to-rule-the-world id say that of course those minds need have grasp of basic facts accounting logic as well as their kindness compassion after all if you mistake minus sign for positive sign all your good-will can become by your sheer ignorance some poor persons abject misery \u0026amp suffering though through no fault of their own aka unemployment thats why you might prefer stephanie tinwoman kelton fictional character who has no heart running some government operations than jacinda adern all heart world but no comprehension of how monetary system works realize that all seems anti-reedian arent promoting bourgois here tinwoman kelton no am not it just cartoon example counterfactual not real world mean have think about it id far prefer full employment job guarantee but under some heartless sociopaths dispensing scorepoints than massive generational suffering crippling of unemployment under some happy-go-lucky liberal clowns who go about defending lgbtq+ rights what human rights are worth having if you cannot get enough tax credits just pay your rent this is of course null dichotomy counterfactual more often two minds go hand-in-hand for wise compassionate person some sort of position of temporary power is far more likely acknowledge reality of mmt \u0026mdash source of all unemployment is government policy they will then fix it or at least die trying but this takes time jacinda did not make time but she could have she had heart soul for it labour party neoliberal apparatchiks too noisy her ears \u0026mdash which is one reason why you do not want apple inc iphone ibuds airbuds or whatever probably got some malicious neoliberal firmware etched into them they drowned out her better angel impulses hard blame her completely btw am happy write all that under adolph reed review since highly doubt reed knows deal either though if he nz prime minister dare say wed not today have any child poverty tautologically since for reed ever become pm hed automatically have fully leftiepol dirtbag caucus house majority apologies all kiwis who would be even better prime ministers no.1 eligibility requirement for being elected political office my book of dirtbag is that you do not want be official government politics people force you take up burden you fight against them until you realize you cannot win people basically stick bill legislation under your hand torture you electrodes move your hand so pen marks your signature ok maybe not that extreme think could do job if torture device ham \u0026amp cheese sandwich kalecki\u0026ndashrobinson mind-meld reed parrots what kalecki robinson thought of efforts gain government policy of full employment he quotes kalecki under regime of permanent full employment sack would cease play its role as disciplinary measure social position of boss would be undermined self-assurance class-consciousness of working class would grow strikes for wage increases improvements conditions of work would create political tension it is true that profits would be higher under regime of full employment than they are on average under laissez-faire even rise wage rates resulting from stronger bargaining power of workers is less likely reduce profits than increase prices thus adversely affects only rentier interests but discipline factories political stability are more appreciated than profits by business leaders their class instinct tells them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of view that unemployment is integral part of normal capitalist system which is essentially why we do fact need perhaps pass through some sort of phase of dictatorship of proletariat point is not often enough stressed by cutrone that such dictatorship can be very nice for everyone even formerly super-rich they can probably even retain their pearls we cannot eat them how do workers make pearls diamonds useless hence valueless easy do not covet them so you never need buy them you their fair price is zero who cares then about market for them not said richard wolff better mmt frame issue is we do not live under capitalism so that kaleckian argument does not apply we live under plutocracy or oligopoly take your pick however would guess argument still works because governments are ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ thats because they are largely controlled or influenced by ꕷꖡꖹꘝꕯꕒ oligarchs they are undermining our collective real wealth their imposed austerity argument really is that stupid people cannot figure out that decline their real wealth can be accommodated net rise on overall real wealth whole benefits more than some parts so kaleckian argument really just morphed little bit under unfair labour market oligarch has no cause for nightmares what they should fear is grass roots organization developing take-over of government through entirely peaceful means de facto installing virtual dictatorship of prolertariat only itd only be de facto how simple ordinary decent people get seats government but vote or crook or by hook id prefer by vote but you know how that works it aint gonna happen without grass roots organization since top end of town will never hand it us on wooden platter like trying tell my right-wing or business sympathizing friend other day he wants business people running government since they know how run business laughed or suppressed laugh explained since monetary system is critical for government functioning it needs be more spending than tax return we want opposite of savers-by-mentality running government we want big spenders at this stage twenty-first century neoliberal post-capitalism we are worse then mere capitalism we could do totally drunken sailors parliament seats of power as long as they have kind hearts crack lot of jokes more drunk better am not scared of inflation boogeyman unemployment is not productivity story reed however does eventually disappoint he writes of largely fantastical class harmony post-war usa but how could claim of mutual benefit positive-sum class relations be credible if employers ever more inclined pursue productivity increases that resulted net displacement of living labor no argument that he is correct pointing out fallacy of class harmony he fails however realize private sector productivity technology gains are not unemployment story presumably because reed is unaware that source of all unemployment is government displaced labour is null narrative that is freed labour that capitalists care not about government can always hire displaced labour without question no capitalist ever pays for this fact they benefit all government payments such newly public sector workers is net currency injection which firms can sell soak up hoard driblets from after they have eaten played gold squirrelled away into their bank accounts this mmt account of course does not illegitimate earlier endorsement of kalecki robinson since their arguments still apply precisely because government is essentially or is it virtually run by plutocrats oligarchy or their lapdogs one or other rest of reeds essay would say is academically interesting but we can stop here since this is crux take base case for full employment market not capitalist not socialist not anything particular \u0026mdash just some sort of government which is job guarantee policy then private firm has no fear jg is not competing private employers since it is floor wage all firm needs do is offer slightly better than jg wage benefits or some suitable combination kalecki robinson had no such understanding so fact ultimately null framing issue of full employment shame on them however their political power argument still gains some validity its just not as bad for us as they made out today this is counterfactual argument so bit pointless but it is still interesting ponder if usa had jg would private employers really be complaining theyd likely be making more sales hence more profit only few utterly oppressive employers would go out of business no one would shed tears for them my lazy guess is that jg will still have opposition congress or nz our parliament because people are just ignorant cannot see their own benefit new zealand particular since we have pretty historically low corruption rates compared other nations our businesses are pretty clean would say most are not rent-seeking scum could be wrong my lazy guess is that bigger more powerful private employers their lobby groups would just simply oppose jg just for hellofit cut off their sales \u0026amp profit noses spite their face of course irl thats their employees faces their own faces get plenty of economic plastic surgery thanks government hand-outs like treasury bonds llc protection laws failure regulate monopoly price takers rentiers all rest. they are not nice people that is crux of it it is not macroeconomics or political economy issue per se it is moral issue spiritual issue how raise class consciousness for most leftists would imagine lack of class consciousness among workers people who for whatever reason need or want sell their labour time but do not own business aka means of production is major problem modern political economy power elite general petite bourgeois actively try prevent this conscisouness from being raised all manner of ways from schools lobyists think tank whitepapers right-wing ngos fakeleft-wing-centrist ngos advertising media entertainment cartels reed points out magic marxists are not helping since they all think ‘scientific’ forces magical thinkingwill automatically raise class consciousness via historical materialist necessity or dynamics this sense most marxists who are materialists share more common silicon valley nerdreich than myself we are just wetware machines so machines can also be conscious reed asks how does consciousness arise form class position he implicitly is saying that this requires acts of human will organization education mobilization he accuses magic marxists scientific socialists of failing grasp these hard cold concrete realities whether actual people who conform reeds stereotypical magic marxists exist around us is me moot point whether such people are polluting discourse or not when you hear them then maybe take it upon yourself as public duty debunk them \u0026mdash for purpose of actively raising class consciousness neoliberal rentiers never miss chance profit from crisis good leftipol should never miss opportunity help others profit from magical thinker last words ill let reed have last words spare you needing read his whole long-winded can-you-plz-get-to-the-point essay it wraps things up his conclusion bears nothing disagree its just that one of weaponized lies is critical one that reed has missed myth of mainstream macroeconomics that government needs find money so has either tax or borrow.\u0026quot unless that myth is busted \u0026mdash minds of workers who are prepared organize \u0026mdash efforts reed urges us undertake could be utterly vain not only is grass roots labour organization needed but educational layer needs laying first \u0026mdash or parallel since why wait for learning we can walk shoot matrix at same time workers have know that when good people seize power start spending like drunken sailors by typing numbers into worker bank accounts that nothing will collapse or crumble no unit of account is going head zero states unit of account is always worth exactly what government says you have do get one unit if only kalecki robinson had known it might have filtered through reed mcalevey two fo \u0026lsquogood guys countering effects of half-century of barely challenged neoliberal hegemony will require great effort of political education organizing combat weaponized lies subterfuge that define american politics today this will have be conducted

pay for it avoided that satz but you just know it has high chance of appearing anyway its crime when government policy is causing house prices become unaffordable except for investors but thing is why do we accept houses need be on market first place price discovery no because construction workers their materials are already accounted for there is market for all that basic human need of affordable healthy housing like clean water is paramount there is no business for market be involved do we need market instead for people exercise preferences well guess theres debate on how government run housing should be run but it is always possible for government proper step out of business government already has agents operating housing market called banks mortgage is after all agreement pay states unit of account banker is all cases acting as agent of government model could thus be by government dictat that all people rent-to-own house no speculators allowed 100% tax rate on private rents owner unoccupied home houses does this mean construction market just squirts out into high rises no homes no because again construction firms need permit from state which means again they are acting as agents of state it is all government policy landlords are not increasing your rent illegally does it mean everyone will be living east german or soviet era domiciles no because government does not need dictate architects we are limited by our real resources imaginations so if our architects lack imaginations or materials for their builders then we can only have what they can conjure but if they can conjure up nice houses for all people then that is what we all can have would say new zealand that is pretty nice home better than what ive ever had private construction firms can compete openly for public contracts all that stuff theres still market underneath where it needs be has open so political favourtism shenanigans do not ensue or just organize get decent people into

squeeze out few pdf’s from one stevek for those who have not read jmk original ideas am digressing from my script now there are many excuses we could give this strawman jmk fixed exchange rates paradigm of time they no one aware of even concept of floating exchange rates highly doubt it but granted mindset different it era post-ww-ii when united nations ideal still plausible hence it made complete sense create more tightly coupled international currency system heck even world currency why not after all point of keynes’ side of things benefit poorer nations thing is after horrific european \u0026amp northern pacific world war people had massive appetite for peace international brotherhood sisterhood so it might have been desirable use bancor system order assist poorer nations specifically increase their import capacity without suffering domestic inflation pressures which although sustainable perpetuity must be acknowledged as null psychological political liability key here is it might have been desirable assist poorer nations via bancor had international political will been favourable two huge qualifiers there which completely counterfactual international will among power elite did not exist therefore it undesirable adopt imf neoliberal amoral technocratic managed fixed exchange rate system jmk might not have been douchebag imperialist or neocolonialist but other

sardoni 2007 which is good discussion of why bancor plan flawed why for interim period history up present day floating exchange rate environment is superior history is what it although floating exchange rates known they not understood so jmk stuck sticky paradigm there is little evidence that either bancor plan or bretton woods regarded floating exchange rates as superior fixed exchange rate paradigm dominated both policy academic thinking until at least 1970s bitter irony for many of us milton friedman one of first more influential economists argue favour of floating exchange rates along harry johnson 1969 friedman johnson not entirely wrong though only pay attention johnson he argued that fundamental argument for flexible exchange rates is that they would allow countries autonomy respect their use of monetary fiscal other policy instruments consistent maintenance of whatever degree of freedom international transactions they chose allow their citizens… except then followed some

is good only if government know it point being if government do not know it then chances are very high they also do not know they are cause of all unemployment they also will not know they have no need issue bonds basic income but only for people who already have money proportion how much money they already have hence are liable issue bonds thus drive needless regressive inflation policy they are liable hope private sector will employ everyone using nairu lens which is null lens all cases but especially null on floating exchange rate float permits government run full employment regardless of import price sensitivity since then domestic fiscal adjustment can always be made this is because that government is never promising deliver foreign currency they can run permanent zero interest rate policy this is important since zirp on fixed exchange rate regime can be inflationary if exports are weak but it all reverses polarity on float when now zirp becomes deflationary biased or at least inflation neutral few mainstream economists acknowledge this reality hence all brainworms they do not understand implications of floating exchange rate all policy we’ve seen since most nations moved float is ample testimony mainstream economists have no clue they are all ignorant or at least those advising governments when neither bancor style help poorest managed regime nor floating

more powerful my mind that truth knowledge sincere desire prize justice be done be seen be done above third rate prize of freedom price of true freedom is effort ensure justice you cannot gain former without latter latter you only have dog-eat-dog libertarianism which is freedom but only for those prepared trample over others dont think you can find single leftist mmter anywhere who would disagree that power hierarchies power dynamics are critical we cannot gain emancipation justice without seizing state power its not about freedom from labour its about free enjoy fruits of your labour since we spend most of our living day at work places this is where power-to-seize is most important but realpolitik today we cannot gain workplace democracy without support of government because government creates all markets for things for sale state scorepoints so government is what creates labour market labour market is deeply unfair game it is moral obligation of maker of market remove injustice regardless of which political party is power they all suffer same moral ineptitude if they allow injustice persist it is not role of private sector ensure workplace justice but bosses too should feel moral compulsion just because they are human beings but you know death bosses as well they dont own us we are donating our labour time dammit they owe us we dont owe them squat but without government job guarantee our donation of labour is coerced not given freely this is basic injustice it is most basic macroeconomic injustice of all it turns what is sacred \u0026mdash our work \u0026mdash into abomination theres nothing worse my mind bar actual deliberate genocide but my mind unemployment is far worse than genocide only say genocide is worse because it is planned deliberate whereas government enforced unemployment is merely ignorance \u0026mdash deadly ignorant fraud it kills millions every year gaza is by comparison walk park dark so why are breadtubers so weak pathetic afraid

honest superman is fascist who is respectable enough take home you meet your parents batman is honest one whom you want stay hell away from as he saves your ꗇꕷꕷ from fictional inflaton boogeyman batman is more respectable end then but thats wrong word what is appropriate word comprehensible it is comprehensible why so many people worship batman all good people have innate appreciation reverence for honesty this does not excuse their fascism you can see this todays clown king phenome djt turn it all around we need wake people up their inner collective batman we are all defenders of

wrong about justice for working class do not take your eye off prize either prize is eliminate economic class inequality not alleviate material poverty former guarantees latter not other way around all attempts at state welfare have always failed but do you ubi sᵢmᵖlₑtᵒn iⁿnₒcᵉnₜ 𝖈𝖚𝖓𝖙𝖘 understand why liberal state welfare is what we do not want what we want is social welfare what does that mean it means we want control over our own lives so that we never need appeal state welfare only welfare worth having comes from our own community legitimate state apparatus should exist modern times acknowledge all past history is sewage under bridge order facilitate community welfare that means basic stuff like helping serving each other this is anti-servitude if you just have no idea what am talking about are suffering brain hemorrhage from cognitive dissonance then do apologize but no one ever said learning easy people who think other way around jaccuse as guilty of money fetish it is

keystrokes spare tangled webbs of transparent deceit anyone who has read both aaron good whitney webb we could name drop several more but lets not name drop will know of how us deep state is misnomer there is state within state just as angletons cia within cia but it is global span us empire is global usa is convenient geographic hub because it is ideal place run organized crime criminal sub-government enterprises ive got message though for good honest people government positions which is do not feel you are complicit speak out whistle blow dont shy away from exposing corruption system you are part of do not fear for losing your salary id cite sibel edwards as good exemplar she only spent about one year fbi before realizing she had whistleblow although edmonds aaron have lot of content behind paywalls those means aught support them because they trickle out bit of free tier content for us plebs it is good stuff know at least be aware about huge boooo otherwise paywalled websites mean what are you doing guys asking us pay for honest reportage ill donate more than most people would fro their income such indie reporting but refuse go via paywall like patreon who are taking gross cut of donations always conduct due diligence on payments platform believe kofi is ok few others make sure you are not accidentally donating corporate fascists=ic outfits this is also why specifically ask readers not subscribe my substack stay of free tier you wont miss anything form me anti-government government this is potential utter mess of topic so ill try minimize keystrokes get point across we need government not for survival or anything but just for civil society we do not need corrupt government we should desire democracy we have never had democracy we need be anti-that-government we need be pro-this-government you get drift of what _this_ \u0026lsquothat mean trust it will be government that holds jee organized crime bosses account one way or another if ever they are held account it will not be our consumer boycotts refugees victims of ethnic cleansing did need resources provided by usaid but world did not need usaid government must do big fiscal government must be frugal about real resources but that means fully employing available sustainable resources but not wage-slavery manner cia within cia has not been government supported cia within cia does not get congressional appropriations which is why those particular darker covert operations need you be drug user boozer sex addict angletons branch of government has use drug pr0n booze prostitution aka hospitality gambling sex trafficking get funded that branch of government is tax payer funded only branch that really is stop funding that branch of government its better reason stop using drugs or gambling etc than anything topper gore ever said having noted all that us congress is enabling fascism through its neoliberalism so even good folks congress parliaments around world are not speaking out enough arre far too naïve guys gals seats its ok lift-up rocks now again see what is underneath criminal enterprises are not boogeymen when you expose them sunlight on darker note if you are honest person desiring enter into government think you have be completely unafraid get assassinated at least usa other kleptocratic nations saudi arabia eu turkey nigeria so on its long list we could go deeper bds these days means much more than boycotting known israeli businesses their ties since network of cia\u0026ndashmossad\u0026ndashmafia worldwide crime syndicate network really since its mess of inside blackmailing grift against grifters against grifters you get picture odds are you are still indirectly funding your actual tax dollars some zionist project or another might even be doing so myself when purchase my coffee beans but ill be damned if know about company behind beans is part of worldwide crime racket then continue buying those beans its not huge waste of time just skim some consumer products realize you should boycott them start micro$oft apple inc products would say do not give spotify joe rogan or anyone else that space your cash do not even give them advertising revenue by clicking on them for free theyre owning your eye-balls you realize entire pop music industry is another one boycott its not going make you life more miserable not support pop music marvel movies if you wish break law boycott but still consume content then pirate website might be valid way go about it but you have realize they still effect are owning your eye-balls since propaganda is deep these corporate entertainment complex layers id just advise get other hobbies like theoretical physics rock climbing or gardening giving up hope on civil society is not answer but you do get some elements of nihilism doomerism aaron goods podcasts its forgiveable it is remarkable though when aaron does offer positive outlook precisely because hes one of those researchers who has gone deep into near bottomless pit of corruption organized crime that is part of much of world wide system of government am pretty sure it touches un as well emerge from such research without going full nihilist is testament aarons good character thats why can listen some of his more outrageous claims without getting too skeptical conspiracy theories are always little dubious because they are conspiracy theories but not all theories are wrong however regarding things like jfk assassination or really assassination of good four jfk mlk malcom rfk \u0026mdash its distraction reckon there have been far more important figures assassinated do not even know where begin but some names that drop into my head without internet search would be mossadegh nassar sankara allende thats not even mention those not yet assassinated like dilma-rousseff who generous enough not believe us cia behind her impeachment think point is they did not have be worldwide organized government-mafia crime network does not always need cia so it is immaterial whether cia behind brazilian lawfare those material realities do matter when people can be held account but work pro-worker peace-camp has ahead is far harder than just getting few foot-soldiers for global zionist-fascism-plutocracy on hague chopping blocks whatnot this reminds me of one of aarons positive comments which is that worldwide peace \u0026amp reconciliation process is needed for all neocons neoliberals since crimes have surpassed those of apartheid south africa so we are far beyond jail cell punishments by now global tory-conservative reich-wing empires are always fully prepared sacrifice foot soldiers jee most recent news but even if drew up full list of all peace-leaders itd be nothing but list names do not matter which is not say erasing names from history is good its not good but it is say far more unnamed people have been real power behind these courageous spokespeople for people when sanakara or allende gets killed millions of ordinary people have been killed because their hope has been dashed their spirits weakened which is worse thing which is precisely why we simply cannot afford place our trust hope big name leaders they are only temporary spokespeople always nothing more best thing about jeremy corbyn 2016 version not corbyn it idea of enabling worker cooperatives polyarchy one thing wanted get off my chest todya is mmt related concerns usaid am grateful aaron good his guest ben thomason on devil’s chessboard podcat ive read heard far too many liberals attacking djt doge for defunding usaid wanna know my take good damn riddance usaid usa is not world saviour superman no one anywhere ever needed usaid nor national endowment for democracy more anti-democratic institution is hard find this are both highly anti-democratic organizations promoting fascist-zionism most insidious ways there are ordinary workers employed or volunteering for such organizations who are innocent doing good things but it is total fabricated myth that us dollar ever needed for such efforts total myth they promoting real democracy see my previous post on why us dollar never global reserve currency \u0026mdash no one has ever needed us$ except us tax payer ive never handled us dollar myself except when working as postdoc on h1b usa what ive used probably quite bit are international banking swaplines \u0026mdash spreadsheet operations which from my end only ever concern nz dollars if id have had few billion nzd could have funded everything good that usaid supposed be doing but minus propaganda when not overt cia fronts these organizations are low-key propagandists for american capitalist corporate values \u0026mdash greed is good stuff being rich makes you virtuous stuff venture philanthropy stuff profit make do good stuff since cannot devote much time researching topic of how corporatist propaganda spreads through soft neocolonialism corporate philanthropy fake 𝕒𝕗 all that crud am glad have found ben thomason has done that hard work that interview ben is where first heard term polyarchy thats rule by whole blend of neocons neoliberals zionist-christian right-wingnuts coopted leftist rubes liberal moralists anti-moral people mafia bossesunion bosses all rest by way am saying it is good thing djt his cronies shut down usaid think so yes its normie establishment liberal hair-on-fire reaction think closing down usaid killed millions starving of real aid probably did kill millions but that not fault of djt every country where people starving dying from local genocides ethnic cleansings could have easily been avoided by other nations shipping supplies us dollar never needed goods from usa not either there are plenty of other sources for supplies that refugees needed if usa happens contribute substantial fraction then great but it never had be usaid un would have sufficed un does not need us dollar for funding any currency will suffice new zealand should just drop trillion dollar nzd coin bank account of un then people will have precious nzd buy stuff for un deployment what are they gonna buy if its not for sale new zealand theyre going have buy from somewhere else they could always do so nzd it would not weaken nzd forex lines are not source of nzd price level what else can tell you would this have some re-gauge effects domestically nz probably but so what it would not limit nz government capacity run domestic full employment so would have no bad consequences for nz economy we do not have export anything we do not desire export surplus our domestic needs not ever we need foreign oil so we need export pay for those imports if our government had political support from people trillion-dollar coin fund un we could do it its always political will spend not scorepoint capacity back global mafia-government worldwide empire yeah so our governments are not global mafia state network this is not message you should be receiving many parts of our governments are part of global fascist mafia world state its very messy thing for example bill clinton compromised no doubt he fascist probably not he worse than fascist since he captured by neoliberalism far more insidious cause of mass human suffering yes id say so prefer my fascist their swastika on their sleeve preferably their proud forehead governments have been infected fascist-zionism-mafiosi thats just fact this does not make government inherently corrupt institutions it means you aught be very wary of any government policy that smells bit fishy reeks of privatization of public services meme since thats stuff that is revealing infection thats what needs laser surgery removal where point laser beams well do not think thats hard question answer you only need do tiny bit of research often crooked politicians are just saying quiet part out loud any user pays or efficiency of private sector or wastin tax payer dollars rhetoric is self-revealing cancer that needs be zapped yes even tyt krystal \u0026amp kyle majority report all rest of liberal media are part of rot theyre all about wastin of tax payer dollars that has be zapped let me be clear once more when you buy your drugs for your partying you are tax payer funder thats only time you are proverbial tax payer funder you are funding extra-governmental syndicates of criminal global governance non-government government tax payer funds private sector whole point is stop having our governments being run by private sector because when they are run by private sector they are tax payer funded thats only time government is tax payer funded deep state particularly criminal branch of it is private sector that is whom you are funding when you consume slop like coca cola nestlé spotify netflix appleinc all rest have cut-back on some of that stuff is what id suggest its minimal least effort does this mean buying few bananas from grocery store shipped by some global fascist mafia-like run fruit-grower worker exploitation corporation is complicit no of course not no more so than watching your favourite marvel movies but yet there are things you can live without it is good thing try live without for while but do we instead say regarding government terrorism ok it is so infected now it just has be euthanized hole lot no do not think we are there yet guess we coudl get there but there are still too many good people government they are not prominent headline names of curse but it si baby \u0026amp bath water situation from what can tell what is one do my first answer is at least not be dupe rube deliberately ignorant doomers or boomers neither educate yourself just do what little you can fight back best join pro-worker pro-justice organization somewhere one good organic leaders not unelected hierarchy but it cannot be anarchist it has be well-organized or you are wasting your effort if doubt learn this from vincent bevin if we burn you maybe shouldnt love bernie but he more organic than obama obama came from neoliberal lab experiment sorry ive run out of keystrokes.🤣 previous post back next post mamdemsocks toc
