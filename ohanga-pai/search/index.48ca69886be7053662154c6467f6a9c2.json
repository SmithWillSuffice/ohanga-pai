[{"content":"why does anything matter will always consider spiritual economics which ōhanga pai is all about as way above beyond mmt thing about cold hard mmt is that it is open critique of fetishizing work although plenty of mmt scholars point out thats null bad-faith attack \u0026mdash agree most mmt economists activists also share same spiritual lens do they are just too sheepish admit macroeconomics is more about justice than distribution of output economists do not get trained morals ethics so do not know how speak that language except like babies theyll go data before sound morals spiritual economics does not put morals ahead of data nor reverse theyre same use of good data is moral commitment checking data is accurate is moral commitment trustworthiness here ill quote my favourite mmter warren mosler either you believe informed electorate or you do not prefer informed electorate one sense that can be taken as rationalists attitude but it is deeply spiritual reason nations tolerate poverty unemployment is because they do not understand their monetary system is both cause of all unemployment means completely eliminate that same unemployment so if we do not have electorate informed about mmt basics think we have nation that is living well below its means mosler is mainly referring economists like samuelson krugman who believe strongly ignorant electorate see samuelson interview here these idiot believe$^\\ast$ keeping citizens ignorant because they think it is good idea hide truth about government power responsibility form citizens they believe creating artificial scarcity as do cryptocurrency libertarian fascists $^\\ast$ be fair paul krugman probably does not believe this he is just one of ignorant samuelson obviously not ignorant did believe there need keep citizens ignorant about mmt system samuelson understood lot of what is now called mmt but did not want mmt informed policy he sociopath pure simple only excuse id give samuelson that he had fixed exchange rate gold standard mental disease if your framework is fixed exchange rates bretton-woods or gold standard then you are going inform politicians they may need unemployed buffer of labour fix exchange rate prevent inflation mmt tells you it is possible have full employment absolute full employment so nairu 0% price stability if exchange rate is floated central bank runs zirp job guarantee as employed buffer of labour government allows deficit float it is fair say samuelson truly ignorant about advantage of this set of policies understand more about this first lets define f-mmt as just mmt framework \u0026mdash this is macroeconomics lens you get when you understand raw mmt as mosler\u0026#39s books or bill mitchell\u0026#39s brilliant blog even aussies are useful for some things but im not so sure bill is aussie hes more like gangly hairy human unicorn who talks like hed smell of weed but probably smells of 1960s aftershave dude p-mmt as policy space one can adopt mmt economy so if you are australia canada japan nz uk usa what p-mmt does for us \u0026mdash here im speaking about policy side that policy which is well-informed by mmt framework \u0026mdash is that vision of both marx keynes is already possible we could have today three hour work week little decline standard of living enormous cuts power consumption energy use is not problem for environment its our rate of energy consumption thats problem energy time power most of that problem power consumption problem is excessive power use by top 10% of humanity which if eliminated as sub-species no one lower 90% of us plebs would miss got it so mmt shows us how realize vision of keynes marx keynes wrote that human dignified work week could be reduced around three hours leaving people more time for leisure getting along their family marx engels wrote it slogan from each according their ability each according their needs those are solid principles only dorky pedants have criticized them theyre never good faith call this vision freakin opposite of fetishizing work more workers we can employ less each individual worker needs work each week call this core mmt from working class left but its still less than spiritual economics can give you it is still pretty cold grey mmt you want some colour injected into this art work as worship what this all means take from baháʼí writings do not read that reference if youre anti-religion if you think you have decent sense of economic justice you wont need read it of course if you have decent sense of economic justice you really are religious non-denominational sense at least justice being idealists spiritual virtue aside for what its worth above baháʼí excerpt cited is as spiritual view of mmt job guarantee policy as ive read anywhere its example of what mean by going beyond mmt we can elevate class consciousness work done service of humanity as form of living akin worship baháʼí canonical writings make this elevation something socialists have failed grok we are however crucially no longer talking about wage-slave labour make-work or any of that gross sh*t excuse profanity any baháʼí readers no what we are talking about is useful dignified work not job but more life vocation craft profession skill performed service humanity talking about things such as writing awesome pop songs or just lyrics or that more sublime thing that radiohead do also talking janitors farmers nurses teachers as top wage workers because theyre most important people society this is not exhaustive list they do not have work more than three hours day if we have enough people who know janitorial work is dignified work then three hours day aught do it clean up your room yourself you other lobsters what we do not want fetishsize is wage form of work reason we should want work is for service not wage wage should be decent reciprocal \u0026mdash thats why janitors waste care workers should get highest wages so no longer speaking about capitalism my dudes or at least we are talking about greatly expanded salary enriched public service sector pay them decent wages well have too many of them turning up so some will need be rejected go back writing pop songs by way by nature science geeks pop music writers will have be permitted work more than three days week so at same wage rate as janitor or teacher theyll get higher gross annual salary perhaps if they want extra work hours if youve ever been song writer or science geek youll know what mean these people cannot be restrained three days week theyd consider that barbaric intolerable work time-energy for scientist is not definable they just do science you cannot sop them they do it their sleep principle decent civilized society is leave scientists artists alone if they want work professional lab supervisors so they do not sink planet into laboratory black hole as long as theyre not doing anything stupid entirely useless or illegal let them do science freedom who decides what is useless science this is pretty impossible completely answer people thought electricity useless faradays only retort yes but someday government will tax it which clever retort because it contained implicit wisdom that he knew electricity going be incredibly useful he just did not know how answer is that we demos get decide what is useful science research we might get it badly wrong but so what public science labs can always be permitted some freedom do useless research we used call it blue sky research sometimes it is fraudulent wasteful but we eventually figure that out shut it down superconducting supercollider ssc texas aside actually ssc not useless science administrators frauds miss-using government funds throwing wild parties whatnot congress rightly shut ssc down physicists wept however congress briefed on scientific merit importance of ssc they just could not figure out way tame bureaucratic administrators because you know they neoliberals lesson for physicists your public purpose job is not just do physics you have moral ethical responsibility too anti-inflation run economy hot\u0026quot scholar sam levey wrote nice article about bullsh-t jobs fight bullsh*t jobs run economy hot this principle is well-known keynesian economists proper sort not fake chaps called new keynesians who think they know keynes but bastardize great man if you want squeeze employers force them compete for workers keeping real wage high then you need some inflation but inflation needs be demand-driven from base its no good if supply of goods is artificially constrained very stupid form of austerity no one subscribes not even neoliberals or perhaps green fascists do inflation is not single type of phenomenon you see inflation can happen many ways some for good wage-led or demand-pull some for bad supply-led or cost-push heres trick though not only does moderate demand-pull inflation help squeeze out bullsh-t jobs employers cannot afford slack workers it also eliminates real inflation what that means is that when workers are fully employed non-bullsh*t jobs weve maximised useful production capacity nominal currency inflation is then irrelevant it can be continued indefinitely since currency unit is fiat it is not something society can ever run out of we can run out of real resources nominal inflation defined as rate of change how much stuff unit of currency can purchase is thus not necessarily of any concern what matters for economic justice is real inflation \u0026mdash which is defined as rate of change how much stuff your entire annual income can purchase trick is eliminating bullsh-t jobs increases real wage thats what is important this is regardless of what happens nominal wage which is correlated cpi inflation largely non-important metric if taken out of real wage context what counts as stupid or illegal or bullsh*t work its always struck me this is question which is up demos answer it can evolve time according human needs know that random arsony is bullsh*t job so is being ceo of predatory financial firm like bank that issues fraudulent loans messes multiple layers of collateralized debt securities which are aptly orwellian named since theyre most fragile insecure financial instruments man has yet devised david graeber identified enough bullsh*t job types help decent society eliminate as many as we

myths about government deficits myth government deficits accumulate government debt which must be paid back higher taxes myth government deficits are not stimulus because increasing money supply which is what net government deficit does will just increase prices if no taxes are raised so purchasing power of extra dollars lowers adjust status quo net effect is just temporary disruption market myths can be true of course but these are both null myth is true first part yes government deficits accumulate into government debt myth is that has has be repaid but there is second sub-myth associated this one which is about tax return that pays for rising government deficit myth is ricardian equivalence fallacy it is null myth because it implicitly uses qtm myth that increasing money supply causes price inflation we already debunked this chapter on inflation but below we can add few more nuances lets look at these more detail myths about deficit pay-back government deficits accumulate government debt \u0026mdash true government debt however is held form of each of these money forms cash wallets bank deposits treasury bonds treasury bonds are functionally like government guaranteed bank term deposits they promise interest payments cash bank deposits that are not being spent are demand leakages so are not causing inflation thus not causing any higher tax return government does not need take back this cash those bank deposits government has already issued t=he money that used buy bonds it formerly cash or bank deposit swapped now for interest bearing treasury security most people think of national debt as only treasury bonds \u0026mdash why because these are only forms of government deficit that government promises pay interest on so is obligation over above obligation merely accept currency back as payment redemption for tax liabilities rising government debt means higher tax return \u0026mdash true for most economies when government debt rises there is more currency but it is not always being spent but lets suppose it is being spent so not all held as bonds then increase financial activity governments tax credits will automatically increase tax return but this is automatic no new extra taxes are needed sales tax fia tax for example is sufficient but those are regressive taxes suppose there just flat land tax per acre of unoccupied land or per cubic metre of occupied real estate there is no burden on government accepting back their own currency for payment of these taxes they always redeem why would they not burden is on non-government sector but this is good thing myth is that this is bad thing if economy is booming non-government sector is dong well any poverty unemployment is dealt by distribution policies not monetary or tax policy so increased automatic tax return has function of automatically helping stabilize prices this is good thing not bad thing this warren moslers seventh of seven deadly innocent frauds of economic policy no rising government debt today means higher tax return tomorrow this is true myth is that it is bad thing myths about deficit not being stimulus already gave one-liner on ricardian equivalence its null myth idea is that government deficits are not stimulus because increasing money supply which is what net government deficit does will just increase prices if no taxes are raised so purchasing power of extra dollars lowers adjust status quo net effect is just temporary disruption market popular economics reasoning behind ricardian equivalence is deification of average person market power someone who has lot of currency which is that they take look at government deficit factor this into their consumption choices hold on cash or spend mythical idea is that such rational people we all are that we go on short spending spree but then defer our consumption if we see rising government deficit because we think this will inflate prices soon so we wait until we starve or deplete what we got from our spree before making our consumption future once inflation comes down \u0026mdash or something like this interest rates also will play minor role this extent interest rate is penalty for holding cash rather than bonds or spending it total bullsh*t of course no one thinks acts this way except neoclassical economist even then only their dreams reality is that prices are determined by relative value stories so government deficits targeted move production from wasteful sectors productive sectors violate ricardian equivalence meaning they are direct stimulus other demand leakages savings can be insatiable they obviate need for tax return stabilize prices so provided there are people insatiable desires save ricardian equivalence is again violated government net spending can be great stimulus if spent wisely on real production having stated these points burden of proof is on economists who still think ricardian equivalence is effective for any given country it might be case ricardian equivalence will apply but that will only be case if their economy is at full employment or has reached some other bottleneck if you do not like this theoretical reasoning then urge you take look at any reasonably healthy economy during war time their governments always increase government deficit it is massive stimulus cost of this is shift of production from say farm implements missiles guns ammo but it is still stimulus can be empirically checked tax pay for is automatic as per moslers 7th of seven deadly frauds governments get war time stimulus needed without needing raise taxes provided existing tax rate is progressive major wars like ww-2 governments typically have do bit more than rely on automatic stabilising tax return they typically need withdraw demand from sectors that war effort is borrowing real resources from such as labour non-war machinery production automobiles other equipment oil governments withdraw this demand mix of polices some fees lot of war bonds lot of rationing some price fixing along subsidies so there is weak ricardian effect here but it is not anything any rational agent can foresee since no one knows when war will end it is debatable whether modern neoliberal governments understand any of this they probably do not so if they get into major war theyll probably cause hyper-inflation until war stops mmt tells them they do not need tolerate hyperinflation during pandemic or war but will they listen probably not theyre ideologues who do not respect reality of monetary systems keynes knew this already before mmt letter fdr keynes put it fairly plainly broadly speaking therefore increase of output cannot occur unless by operation of one or other of three factors individuals must be induced spend more out of their existing incomes or business world must be induced either by increased confidence prospects or by lower rate of interest create additional current incomes hands of their employees which is what happens when either working or fixed capital of country is being increased or public authority must be called aid create additional current incomes through expenditure of borrowed or printed money bad times first factor cannot be expected work on sufficient scale second factor will come as second wave of attack on slump after tide has been turned by expenditures of public authority it is therefore only from third factor that we can expect initial major impulse euro economist dirk ehnts put it like this bit further down text keynes says that monetary policy should aim at maintenance of cheap abundant credit particular reduction of long-term rates of interest clearly keynes thinks about combinations of interest rates levels of government spending that lead full employment but it is government spending that is of utmost importance another way put this is that government net spending provides collateral whereby firms macro can be confident bank credit they use for investment can be paid back

continual increase general price level it is imprecisely measured by indicators like cpi consumer price index weighted index of prices of typical commodities for sale state currency units does government net spending cause inflation if you think yes then you have succumbed quantity theory of money qtm myth note that qtm identiy is equation that expresses identity so it is not wrong rate of circulation of currency $mv$ is equal identically quantity of goods produced $q$ that get sold at price level $p$ so $mv=qp$ myth is that raising $m$ causes rise $p$ this austrian school neoclassical story is obviously null most firms will try raise $q$ before their particular $p$ so aggregate we hardly ever get pressure on general price level at macroeconomic level form just rise money stock $m$ also rise money stock gets roughly 20% saved so not spent so is not adding anything price pressure finally even if everyone spent all their income why would price $p$ necessarily go up if firms can meet demand again by raising $q$ by hiring more labour or bringing online idle machine capacity it is only when firms cannot easily raise $q$ that they feel pressure mark-up their prices due various effects not least of which is wanting retain customers even then this has happen wholesale throughout entire economy get general price level inflation that is rare only wars famine plagues tend cause general supply shortage or perennial problem supply of raw energy oil mainly which explains most if not all of inflations of 1970s early 80s quite significant fraction of post-covid inflation if get around it we will later do some empirical work validate this hypothesis against alternate that post-covid inflation caused by profligate government spending reality is that never all recorded history have government deficits caused hyperinflations causality has always been reverse cause of all hyperinflations everywhere have been supply shock events like war war reparations pestilence drought or famine plagues reason government deficits increase during hyper-inflation events is because people find real goods scarce supply so people are competing for purchasing power government welfare payments have inflationary bias such cases government is forced involuntarily issue more currency poor this puts pressure on prices but cause is supply shock cost-push not governments non-discretionary impact on demand-pull there is good analysis about this direction of causation for case of weimar germany here however such inflation is indefinitely sustainable${}^\\ast$ fix stop inflation is eliminate source of supply shock ${}^\\ast$ unless government is promising redemption gold bullion for its tax credit or for water or pizza which government cannot promise forever deliver so generally governments no longer promise such redemption instead will tick off your tax payment instead as redemption so currency inflation is natural reaction event supply shock source is what needs be corrected not monetary inflation once supply chains goods supplies are restored hyperinflation always stops dead remember inflation is continual increase price level it is extremely hard for government keep inflation going even if it wanted because if supply is good people dont just take money issued by their government go out eat more or travel more there are physiological limits what people can do since mid 1990s japanese government has desperately been trying get inflation yen prices above 2% they keep failing until covid did it for them not way they wanted any mmt economist could show them how get inflation they want but point is that even governments that want more inflation find it difficult get any if you give people who already are eating enough have shelter more money they tend save it so that case you cannot get any inflation just by raising government deficit there might even be evidence contrary that when governments spend more provided it is functionally targeted good investments real resource supply prices drop because government is offsetting need for bank credit providing for good productive jobs at same time it is another empirical project for ōhanga-pai dig into this causal relationship way japan could get inflation they want would be fully employ all japanese workers give them decent living wages that will make skilled workers scarce for private firms which increases wage bids that will give japan inflation they want very healthy progressive manner few pithy examples quantitative sciences it can be useful for limited purposes consider extremes extreme cases tell you what asymptotics will be so reveal tail ends of dynamics you cannot use asymptotics for shorter run or highly constrained dynamics but inflation story is one where asymptotics are good at revealing few things about relation between currency issue prices consider fruit prices house prices if central government handed me million dollars next pay check \u0026mdash which they can because they can just whip out computer keyboard at central bank type numbers authorized by nice vote congress bribed them for extreme case remember \u0026mdash would not be going out buying million apples id be buying avocados but only dozen since my refrigerator cant keep more than that fresh for long according austeritricians like mr atif mian or any of other new keynesians neoclassicals id be buying thousand avocados probably because do not know how manage my money need neoliberal daddy drip feed me sure see sarcasm dripping off page but this is extent of neoliberal argument for austerity if instead go buy house get one house how is that real estate inflation pressure it isnt if everyone gets free million goes buying house then yep house prices go up but avocado prices dont relative value stories here however time avocado prices should go up because avocado growers notice selling 12 tonnes of avocado year no longer buys them house or mortgage payment so house prices should eventually cause general increase price level but there is quicker way which would be make energy more scarce since energy is far more basic important input into all production so unlike house prices energy price shocks directly cause pretty general inflation events but even then it is difficult for government spending keep inflation going once suppliers catch up demand is government going just pay ever more more for electricity no inflation event stops when supply pressure eases or when alternative supply is created innovation whatnot no government ever decides just issue more currency bid up prices for no reason except maybe for boondoggles pork barrels military spending corruption which guess counts as unnecessary yet does happen below under qtm myth ill use another example farmer police officer story thats another one keep mind its all about relative value when government issues bucket-load really oil tanker load of money suddenly supermarket shelves go bare dont think so households do not have storage capacity can other fictional commodities like purely financial assets like stocks crypto boom price sure because nothing real backs them but then its all ponzi so you go into those fictional commodity markets at your own risk not general public risk no amount of stocks issued by google is going collapse environment stock prices price of stock is supposed reflect real output capacity sales of firm most stock prices however are driven up by ponzi financing so its gambling game \u0026mdash who can hold out longest before stock price adjusts downwards reality warren mosler had great regulatory rule for eliminating this gambling game just limit all stock prices $\\text{\\$2}$ per stock they can start at $\\text{\\$1}$ per share if firm wants raise more capital they can issue more stock this is after all only public good use for stock market it is gain investment capital for firms it is not generate fake income on piece of paper for investors market forces are still then at play since firm will not find buyers of their stock if their firm is known be sales revenue trouble this is also monopoly story all over again firm is monopoly issuer of their iou their stocks so they can either set price or fix quantity let price float sensible option is fix price let quantity float investors are protected when gamble is eliminated it is pure greed that stock prices are permitted go up price without limit based only on psychological ponzi mentality what is qtm myth qtm uses macroeconomic identity $$ $$ on left we have money supply $m$ velocity of money $v$ here $v$ is just rate at which money circulates sales per $1 per year you can take single dollar circulate it very fast passing it from buyer seller who becomes next buyer then seller buyer rapidly enough that single dollar bill can sustain entire small-ish economic system practice people like save on average 80% or thereabouts of their income if they can so circulate money drive commerce supply of currency that grows is more typical than making velocity of circulation more rapid on left-hand side of above equation we have quantity of goods $q$ price level $p$ more exactly $q$ is amount of output that gets sold each year if time period is year then $p$ is average price level over year it does fluctuate it is identity that $mv$ must equal $qp$ it follows from definitions of these four quantities inflation myth is that by increasing money supply $m$ we will necessarily cause prices $p$ rise thats inflation if it is done continuously so lamestream economists tell you this myth that if governments run continual deficit injecting money into economy thus increasing $m$ then we will always get inflation continual rise $p$ this is bogus you can immediately see why or at least hope you can see why there are several reasons why this myth is null fraction of $m$ can be leaked away savings accounts so increasing $m$ via government net spending does not cause increasing $p$ if these savings leakages increase over time period then it directly lowers $v$ so might lower $p$ firms hate raise their prices they like customer loyalty so they will always prefer raise output $q$ instead of raising prices $p$ growing population will having growing output demand for that output so $m$ must increase this case otherwise prices will decrease firms only raise prices either when they find they cannot raise their output or when they have monopoly so have not competition so can greedily just purely price gouge their customers monopolist as rough psychological rule does not care about customer loyalty customers have nowhere else go this is of course major source of inflationary pressure is dominant source of post covid-19 inflation \u0026mdash price gouging by monopolies especially oil cartels people think food producers are also price gouging but oil is main input into food production so not all food producers are price gouging they are just passing through their energy usage costs consumers this is one big problem of unregulated capitalism if left alone firms pass off costs consumers poorest consumers are ones who suffer most it is terribly unjust comment on obviously population cannot grow forever first because carrying capacity of land gets pushed up against but well before that people do not like having lots of kids if they do not have like japan new zealand we have inverted demographic situation meaning relatively fewer young people are generating output for themselves retirees our population however is for now still slowly growing just less fast than past hence for price stability nz we need growing net money supply so nz government must run deficits net fiscal injections or if we are lucky happen see continual drops our import prices we can probably live for while low nz government deficit but this is not up discretion of our government nz government deficit will automatically be lower all other things equal if our import prices are dropping also is quantity sold not all output produced by firms is sold lot is held as stock so when either $m$ or $v$ goes up prices $p$ can remain constant for short time as firms deplete their stocks firms love do this since all stocks eventually depreciate firm keeps non-perishable goods stock only while they think they can later sell them but while they are saving output stock this lowers effective $q$ qtm equation without effecting prices nominal versus real inflation if when government currency injections aka fiscal deficits put pressure on prices it is only because firms have maxed out their output capacity so firms are forced raise their prices suppress demand theyd be bit stupid not any case its social psychology effect they always do raise their prices if they cannot hire more labour or machinery but what counts all this for economic justice is not how much stuff $1 can purchase what always matters is how much stuff your whole income can purchase not what just $1 can purchase decline $1 dollars purchasing power is called nominal inflation it is never serious problem if lowest real wage is rising faster decline of your entire annual income purchasing power is called real inflation it is serious problem got it nominal inflation shown by cpi index other metrics is not cause for concern what is of deep concern is whether your real wage is declining not number on your paycheck nominal inflation can go on forever until end of time no serious economic justice impact real inflation by contrast cannot be sustained indefinitely it hurts poorest most through no fault of their own is unsustainable if we do not want see people dying our streets nominal inflation cpi inflation is only psychological hence political problem it is not economic problem real inflation is serious economic justice problem it is possible have nominal inflation real deflation \u0026mdash decline how much stuff $1 can buy but increase what your total wage can buy fact this is norm how because machine automation hence unit worker productivity pretty much historically always increases its thanks engineering inventiveness science great social unrest from covid-19 pandemic inflation era is decline real wage not nominal rise prices governments can do lot fix this by adopting job guarantee scheme which boosts lowest wage decent living real wage by fiat \u0026mdash government just says this is job guarantee wage take it or leave it job guarantee cannot cause any inflation because private sector bid for unemployed labour is already zero at worst there is one-time upwards adjustment prices when jg is introduced if it is introduced at wage rate higher than existing unemployment benefit caveats telling inflation story correctly is pretty important social discourse too many people get it wrong spreading misinformation ignorance this can hurt our democracy economic justice desires would say most important thing learn about inflation is stark difference between nominal real inflation if you understand difference which is not hard youll have superior understanding than most people who rant hysterically about evils of inflation inflation is not evil provided lowest real wage is rising sometimes moderate inflation is necessary keep lowest real wage rising why full employment ensures real wage is highest possible all other things being equal provided full employment is non-bullsh$\\ast$t jobs full employment non-bullsh$\\ast$t jobs tends imply moderate inflation because there is always some residual job seeking friction even mmt style job guarantee policy running well thats why inflation per se is not inherently evil although be honest would say job guarantee is not quite running well enough if there is residual inflation but any case moderate inflation is healthy because it directly reduces purchasing power of hoarded wealth it is hoarders who are not playing fair monetary system by hoarders do not mean savers families saving for planned future big purchases are not hoarders they have every right be permitted save not get too big inflaton hit help savers banks offer term deposits at roughly going inflation rate so savers most nations today are not really running many risks but banks there is little difference between saver hoarder mean they dont really know difference so term deposit mechanism does unfortunately also benefit hoarders this is why we cannot generally rely upon circuit theory of money endogenous money for fair just economic system there generally has be monopoly net issuer of currency make up for leak currency circulation due both savers hoarders that net issuing institution is government their net currency add is called deficit its good thing overall that it

reality currency issuers do not cannot logically use tax return for their spending currency users like provincial or municipal governments do not need tax receipts for their funding either but local currency-using governments that do not receive sufficient central government grant funds can be forced impose taxes get funds numbers scorepoints their bank accounts myth is that governments need get their own currency off tax-payers before they can spend it think about this for minute youll see why this myth is utter bonkers reason local government should not be needing tax return is because they only need positive numbers their bank accounts by law law can be changed permit permanent overdrafts if overdraft is at private commercial bank that would be silly local government councils should just have overdraft facilities at central bank laws concerning such monetary relations between local central government are pure conventions law can be changed meet needs of people why cant governments logically use tax receipts for spending by accounting logic no one can pay dime taxes until government or its licenced agents first issue currency remember state currency is defined as that which is accepted for payment of taxes fees fines levies imposed by state state currency only comes from government or its licenced banks it cannot legally come from anywhere else it is points on central banks scoreboard secured spreadsheets or olde days ledger books kept under lock key caveat recent years going back history you can find isolated cases where governments have accepted stupid things for redemption of taxes like bitcoins or gold since bitcoins gold are of no use government$^\\ast$ this is insane policy but it has happened it has deflationary bias when gold is accepted because supply of gold is finite every economist alive recognizes nominal inflation privileges wage earners real producers is better have than deflation privileges wealthy hoarders rentiers $^\\ast$ gold is useful for electrical engineering so governments can make some use of gold but there are satisfactory metal alternatives electronics why do governments tax us then purpose of taxation is drive demand for otherwise worthless currency not get supply of scorepoints for monopoly issuer of scorepoints scoreboard at rugby game cannot run out of points award for same reason government cannot ever run out of money such notion is utterly inapplicable for country like new zealand which runs mmt system there are three other purposes for taxation so four altogether as follows tax liabilities not tax receipts drive demand for fiat currency without tax liabilities no one would want work earn currency taxes on polluting production or harmful commerce help reduce those forms of production so-called pigovian taxes taxes can be used as redistributions prevent egregious inherited class hierarchy robin hood taxation tax return withdraws aggregate demand so helps cool off inflation none of purposes are fund government they are all about balancing real economy funding government is inapplicable notion no currency issuing government needs get money order spend it governments neither have money nor do not have money what governments have is simple public monopoly on tax credit issuance redemption they issue state currency by typing numbers into bank accounts comment on demand withdrawal is not technically necessary cool off inflation if people who hoard currency do not spend it just save it then there is no pressure on prices reality people do spend their savings eventually this can have small pressure on prices inflation bias but it is never problem except when supply of goods are scarce as war time or pandemic this case progressive tax rates via bracket creep will automatically cool off inflation economic boom supply shock crisis remedy for inflation is totally different it is increase government investment fix supply gross way do so would be lower taxes but direct functional targeted investments will fix supply crises faster but former scenario tax return is not order for government get their own scorepoints it is rather withdraw scorepoints from non-government sector which reduces claims on real goods produced by firms one-liner reality is taxation deletes currency from circulation it does not supply government currency why fiscal constraints myth here is that people think local governments cannot be trusted spend wisely hence need some sort of market discipline which is imposed by private banks but this is ridiculous why are private banks any superior knowing needs of local community proper regulation upon local state municipality spending is account of what resources spending is procuring if it is procuring yachts for wealthy people it is fraud if it is procuring rent free housing for otherwise homeless people or supplies for hospitals that are needed which provide buffer stocks not waste then it is legitimate when it comes government spending there is no budget constraint proper constraint is real resource availability suitability of spending for public purpose not private interests this principle is one component of functional finance or targetted spending government or demos really that wants thriving private sector making sneakers computers smartphones fast-food or whatever should be careful not spend on purchasing energy hiring already employed workers buying up basic inputs that these private firms need if government competes private sector government will always win if it wants since it is issuer of currency it can pay any price demos had then better not vote for governments that suck up all resources starve private sector generally citizens do not vote for spend-thrift governments so there is historically no known danger of governments spending wildly it just never happens corruption of government institutions happens as does corruption private industry but thats different transparent votes parliaments for spending that voters can or should know about functional finance is opposed neoliberal ideas such as laissez faire policies mmt recognizes that public purpose cannot be protected through laissez faire policies that some component of government spending needs be targeted government should be picking some winners losers not all of them not even most but just what is needed fulfill broadly democratically defined public purpose why heck should government be picking winners losers for couple of reasons as representatives of people governments have responsibility ensure something nebulous called public good they cannot do so laissez faire hands-off approach that lets powerful market players dominate world of finance private markets are not efficient do not allocate resources fairly they allocate according who has most money privilege people power over workers who have work live particular labour market is not fair game government is therefore necessary protect labour workers have work eat employers do not do not have work too much comment this means governments that protect interests of capital over labour are not legitimate governments this is of course my opinion it is not core mmt such opinions are part of ōhanga pai or spiritual economics which goes beyond core mmt there is nothing wrong protecting vital industries too both labour industry can be protected problem occurs when wages for labour are exploitative when business profits are hoarded by bosses not shared equitably workers only government has authority legal power enforcement agencies protect interests of labour trade unions used have some power but never sufficient power trade unions never representative of all workers so not ever truly egalitarian ōhanga pai is not opposed trade unions but we recognize that individual trade associations unions end up pitting workers against workers so are not ideal workers collectively need one union represent all workers that would be more ideal who decides what is public interest demos thats who not market thats only answer weve got that is remotely sensible from thousands of years of representative government or if you like say it this way demos really is market egalitarian market of voice of people one person one vote corporations are not persons governments can always spend as much currency as they like it is their currency it gets withdrawn later tax returns or private savings issue is not how much currency is spent but rather is spending fraudulent or legitimate are real resources available \u0026mdash if not government should not spend on those resources since that just puts pressure on prices if government absolutely has spend on scarce resources for public good it must free up those resources by either taxing or fining private users of those real resources this is political decision political constraint not financial constraint currency issuers have no financial constraints that are not self-imposed tricky thing here is that reality about what should be proper regulations on government spending are not recognized by politicians public or mainstream neoclassical economists so proper reality is not heeded we instead get terrible mix reality confusion about what is possible what actually gets accomplished due unnecessary budget constraints aka austerity government leaders are not doing what is possible help their people they are doing instead bare minimum which causes social unrest it is all needless it is tragedy of epic proportions austerity about issuing currency is needless austerity when real resource limits are being approached then rationing some other forms of conservation are necessary but until such limits are reached there is no need for currency issuing austerity particular human labour all available willing workers can always be fully employed if not by private sector then public sector programs help out local community needs this is concept of two-fold increase human prosperity expanded public sector hiring for public purpose no bullsh*t jobs job guarantee wage floor \u0026mdash which protects workers otherwise unfair labour market game simultaneously stabilizes price level job guarantee policy is necessary if there are involuntary unemployed workers who are willing work but who refuse work for government government does not dictate

toc","date":"2014-10-20","description":null,"permalink":"/ohanga-pai/questions/3_tax_myths/","tags":null,"title":"Tax Myths"},{"content":"this post is foundational know it is not what leftie activists like read straight up definitions about finance economic systems are for nerds right wrong we can point out several things both lefties conservatives get horribly wrong for their own causes even when their hearts are right place foremost among these is tax payer funding myth trouble is requisite background understanding why tax payer funding is myth involves understanding of what money is essence practice thats what this article is about money is everywhere always iou from inception earliest records anthropologists e.g graeber archeologists e.g hudson know about money has always been record of accounts record of credits debits socially money forms are ious owe you of issuers this means money things specifically state currency are records of account currencies are points on scorepoints trusted scoreboards usually maintained at government agents central bank inland revenue service of course not all governments are fully trusted corruption is thing so state currency is only legally points on scoreboard if you your cronies can defraud government then this debases state currency which means it messes up scoreboard governments have plenty of safeguards prevent such fraud which is why their currency units are pretty stable for most part what about cash cash tokens notes coins are detached parts of governments scoreboard that you carry your wallet note this is why bitcoins other cryptocurrencies are not money forms because no one stands ready redeem them for anything they are ponzi scams if someone is trusted redeem every single bitcoin existence for something like bottle of water then bitcoins would become de facto money form \u0026mdash redeemable for bottle of water that would stabilize price too price of bottle of water but you cannot find anyone on earth who promises redeem bitcoin is trusted do so stabilize price of bitcoin already tells you bitcoin is not currency whatever unit price is denominated is currency state currency does also have price own price which is interest rate price you pay for holding on cash why do people hold on cash instead of put it into term deposit earn interest answer is for greater liquidity \u0026mdash you can immediately spend cash you cannot immediately spend out of term deposit thats why they call it term deposit scorepoints you deposit are still forms of money on spreadsheets but theyre earning interest so not 100% liquid most nations permit banks offer you term deposits most nations also sell treasury securities which are state guaranteed term deposits purpose of such instruments is temporarily withdraw demand from circulation this can have temporary effect on cooling off inflation but is only temporary voluntary no one forces you put away cash into term deposit longer term government term deposits treasuries have pro-inflation bias because interest paid on government bonds adds money supply unless government raises tax rates counter this add state currencies are ious of state state currencies are tax credits thats iou so us dollar yen renminbi ukp \u0026ampc all are ious of their nation states case of eurozone is iou of ecb what is state promising redemption state currency redeems for payment of one unit of tax liability what is state currency worth because state always makes good on its promise redeem tax payment it never defaults state currency unit is worth whatever you need do get one there are generally only three ways earn state currency so not considering welfare payments take out bank credit by handing bank promissory note that you will repay thats what credit card agreement does or work for state or contract your services state sell your goods or labour someone who already has earned state currency or received state welfare such cases state tells you what their currency is worth e.g 20 units for one hour of work as park ranger monopoly issuer of iou tells you what their iou is worth they are price setter not price taker there is no market force at work saying what currency is worth what about private market goods for sale state tells you what their currency is worth but since land owners rentiers need pay taxes they need get state currency units on their scoreboard their bank account do so they will either sell goods or charge you me rents how do they know what prices charge or rents charge this is determined by proverbial market forces but secondary markets cannot set price level because they are competing for state currency which they cannot issue they as whole can only get credit from bank or sell public sector there is no other legal way they can get currency pay their taxes they may try dodging taxes but thats risky any case requires paying tax accountant lot of currency units so private markets can only set relative prices all goods for sale are priced relatively relative what state says their currency is worth example police versus farmer state says it will pay anyone 10 units of their tax credits hour work police force farmer who needs pay taxes electric bills because electricity companies need pay taxes says that can grow on average 10 apples hour so ill instead sell apples for one unit all are happy police officer hates digging dirt likes police farmer likes farm tomorrow state comes out by fiat announces we are now paying police officers 20 tax credits hour they just type new numbers into all police officers bank accounts it costs next nothing do so except one single government accountant clerks time farmer responds ok man my apples now sell for 20 units each farmer takes out marker pen crosses out 10 writes 20 on their price tags you could call that printing money state has just caused 100% inflation they devalued currency by 100% simple announcement technically currency re-gauging not inflation since inflation is continual increase price level this is one-off adjustment such is good illustration of how secondary market prices get determined real world its messier because monopolists for supply of apples whatnot stuff up fair relative prices caveats posts this questions section are not going trawl through empirical anthropological data weve instead used references where needed it is

example of new zealand since many people claim mmt only applies country like usa which enjoys global reserve currency status this would be null mmt applies perfectly well small open economy like new zealand currency is nzd bare minimum if you have very sharp mind keen intelligence you can almost derive answers most of basic questions concerning state currency monopoly systems which would describe most monetary systems all major countries today using principles following four subsections system mmt is based on one axiom one legal reality one identity all economies face real resource constraints currency issuers usually these are governments or their licenced agents face no purely financial constraints learn why this is legal reality see what is money sectoral balances sum zero few supporting definitions operational realities real resources material goods workers capital machinery natural re-sources water sunlight land fiat currency unit of account for issuing or settling debts normally single economic region issues only one fiat currency it is defined as that which is accepted for redemption of tax liabilities fees or fines of state most efficient modern forms of fiat currency are electronic digits bank account which is indeed most common form of nzd currency bank reserves banks use reserve accounts held at central bank facilitate payments clearing bank reserves are not used make loans nor are deposits fact deposits are liabilities of bank debts owed by customers are bank’s assets reserve accounts are just spreadsheets at central bank are for payments clearing operations bank credit banks are licenced issue money when they extend credit operationally this is not loan or borrowing by customer because banks do not lend out their reserves deposits bank credit what we tend think of as bank loans are nothing but electronic entries spreadsheet bank marks-up customers account records corresponding debt that customer must repay interest at due date or dates currency issuer or \u0026lsquomoney sovereign monopoly issuer of non-convertible fiat currency floating exchange rate no foreign denominated debt sectoral balances one sectors deficit is anothers surplus mmt macro normally recognizes four sectors government banks house- holds+firms foreign domestic private sector comprises private banks households firms but one can split economy into as many sectors as one likes sectoral balances still sum zero private sector means non-government including all foreigners comment some folks call currency issuing government monetary sovereign but that can be misleading term since full sovereignty is widely recognized mmt circles as connoting whole raft of powers such as food self-sufficiency energy self-sufficiency legislative sovereignty perhaps more all forms of \u0026lsquosovereignty are desirable but currency issuing authority is minimum necessary sufficient for economic region be considered well-described by mmt comment when people first encounter fiat money they usually ask since it is not gold mined out of earth where does government get this money from answer is government does not get money from anywhere nz dollar is unit of account government neither has this stuff nor doesn’t have stuff when they want spend they mark-up someones bank account computer when they tax they mark-down person’s account thats all that happens no gold is lost no one’s grandchild is put at risk no borrowing from china occurs at all another way of putting this is that nzd is states unit of account like kilogram is unit of measure for mass you never own or emit or collect kilograms you can own or collect masses like sheep pancakes potato chips paua kiwifruit apples whatnot you collect certain masses you measure them kilogram unit authority defining measurement unit cannot ever run out of units \u0026mdash its just not applicable concept its like saying you could run out of names for babies they can however run out of real types of mass that measurement unit denominates for macroeconomics critical resource government can run out of is human labour but sense thats good thing if or when government has run out of labour it can hire at existing wages then it knows it has reached full employment further public sector hiring will then just push up wages certain sectors by competing private sector for already employed workers under some conditions this could even be good policy public sector jobs might be more critical than many bullsh*t workers bloated private sector but these are political matters requiring political choices who is say what counts as bullsh*t job money sequence state desires provision itself state imposes tax liabilities payable its currency as tax credit this results sellers of goods services hence also unemployed people seeking state currency state then makes its desired purchases thus from inception is price-setter not price-taker government sets price level taxes are paid bonds purchased what happens state spending after state spends private sector has only two choices use money pay taxes which case it’s removed from economy don’t use money pay taxes which case it remains economy until it is used pay taxes public debt national debt =private savings is funds spent by state that have not yet been used pay taxes it is dollar-for-dollar our private savings government deficit private surplus ‘national debt’ constitutes what is best thought of as net money supply of economy growing economy is expected include growing net money supply unemployment taxation by design causes unemployment residual unemployment \u0026mdash after state hiring spending \u0026mdash is evidence state has not spent enough cover need pay taxes private sector’s desire save out of income if state doesn’t spend enough cover need pay taxes desire save evidence is unemployment reversing unemployment unemployment is evidence that state’s tax policy caused more unemployed than state private sector has hired state has option reduce tax liabilities or get unemployed hired through increased public spending preferably on direct job creation for public purpose job guarantee tax liabilities created more unemployed workers than state wanted hire business resists hiring unemployed prefers hiring people already working any case firms cannot hire if they cannot make sales jg facilitates transition from unemployment private sector employment providing non-government sector net injected supply of money boosting sales jg is superior price anchor vs unemployment unemployment$\\leftrightarrow$basic income jg program is superior automatic stabilizer for otherwise unstable economy summary all state currencies are ious of state what does state owe you answer state says it owes you redemption for payment of tax liabilities state always honours this obligation why would they not state creates need pay tax liabilities it issues only records of account that are accepted for such payments it can always accept them back its just book entries bond story treasury bond operations prelude crucial insight made around 1990 by warren mosler which together bill mitchells insights on buffer stocks for employment kick-started mmt before it known as mmt this realization that when central bank federal reserve usa rbnz new zealand sold or purchased bonds this functionally equivalent treasury selling buying bonds issuance of treasury bonds could thus not be considered borrowing operation issuer of currency can no more borrow from itself than you or can borrow our own ious be sure when you or issue iou we can certainly borrow it back but point is that this serves no purpose other than drain ious from everyone else however if we regard it as borrowing iou is owed back person we borrowed it from so we have not altered net money supply of ious now given that we can write as many ious as we like we are not revenue constrained our own ious so we have no need for borrowing why would we offer borrow our own ious then answer mosler explained that we might do so generate positive interest rate for our ious by offering some interest on those ious that we have borrowed only now we recognize this is not borrowing operation at all it is functionally equivalent of offering savings account term deposit further purpose of offering term deposits backed by government guaranteed interest returns is define term structure of interest rates that serves controlled pro-inflationary purpose stable form of economic stimulus but which mmt recognizes as highly regressive because it amounts little more than welfare for those who already have money greater body of work on mmt recognizes that far more effective way stimulate economy is supply new money at bottom form of either basic income guarantee or even better job guarantee or combination of both but even more effective way fuel economy is for state directly hire workers who are willing take jobs public sector proper because such jobs teachers nurses public attorneys public banking road works police fire-fighters parks wardens sanitation workers electricity utility supply workers conservation workers government r\u0026ampd scientists \u0026ampc all help provide free non-profit public services which lower nominal costs private sector of conducting business cost private sector of all this state sector hiring is real cost not monetary cost cost being those workers any electricity computers paper fuel food resources they consume during their work are now no longer available for hire private sector only mmt has recognized this fact all other schools of economics date claim taxes are paying for these public utilities thus long run are not lowering costs private sector businesses well theyre all wrong mmt is correct money can only come from government net spending or unstably from bank credit extension so when state provides public services not only are they lowering private business costs they actually fund private sector capacity pay their tax liabilities everyone else has money story backwards including most post-keynesians marxists treasury bond story whether central bank or treasury sell bonds function is exactly same \u0026mdash offer interest on savings purpose is not fund government purpose is set desired inter-bank interest rate treasury reserve bank bond operations are thus pure asset swaps cash reserves are swapped for savings account treasuries countries like usa where central bank is forbidden from directly purchasing treasury securities six-step process of bond auctions repo agreements reverse repos is used by-pass law net effect is exactly same as federal reserve purchasing treasuries we call this deficit spending but you can also think of it as government funding itself because functionally it amounts exactly same government issuing its own iou’s booking it as treasury debt \u0026mdash this is left pocket of government treasury owing right-pocket of government central bank but why this charade its make sure no accounting mistakes are made but thats all it serves purpose when central bank has interest rate target mandate if they do not sell bonds when government spends result will be excess reserves banking system which will send overnight cash rate ocr zero maintain desired ocr target central bank must therefore either sell bonds drain reserves or pay interest on reserves either method will work however there is little need inflate economy this way through welfare for those who already have money alternative policy is set permanent zero interest rate zirp zirp no bonds are offered all existing treasuries could be retired at maturity no more issued if central bank does not allow commercial banks have overdraft facilities they could continue issuing three month treasury bills for purposes of ensuring payments clearing system operates smoothly this is bank system software problem not economic problem existing savings schemes like pension plans which rely on interest from treasury bonds could instead be scrapped all pension payments could be made directly each month as promised payments come due there is no need for superannuation trust fund moreover pension payments can be arbitrarily increased dignified living wage since governments cannot run out of money they can choose pension wage which means choosing what proportion of real output retirees can claim superior way stabilize economy is direct fiscal policy money injected at bottom via either job guarantee or basic income guarantee or combination of both coupled progressive tax structure as further automatic stabilizer as inflation rises tax receipts automatically rise cooling off inflation comment fascinating aspect of point of treasury bond story is that even if people think act as if bonds are funding government then they are still wrong other words there is no logical way that selling government bonds is financing operation this follows logically from facts nz dollar is fiat currency iou of government only government can net issue these ious thus not only are treasury bond operations purely for purposes of interest rate control they cannot logically be used for any other public purpose other than basic income for wealthy people comment remark about pension payments is subtle while government can always afford mark-up bank accounts make pension payments if pensioners spend their income wildly this can put pressure on supply of goods which can cause price inflation which once it propagates into higher private sector wages just reduces purchasing power of pension government policy thus needs be informed by stability analysis so that pension payments can be increased above subsistence level they are today but consistent claims on real resources electricity rent groceries \u0026ampc that average pensioner needs that workers can supply main implication is that if we want raise retirement pension it is best guarantee full employment because then we maximize our production of real goods pensioners have claim on consuming idiotic policy would be force people save for retirement because that is demand leakage which contributes unemployment if government does not raise spending or cut taxes lowers our economic output that pensioners are claiming upon if todays workers wish save for their retirement more than government guaranteed pension they can always use bank term deposit or gamble on share market but not real estate gambling which should be banned since it serves no public purpose or rather than banning ownership of second homes for speculation there could be heavy tax on non-owner occupied real estate which lowers necessary tax on owner-occupied housing point of decent society that mmt shows us is possible is that there should be no need for such gambling government pension can always be made afford decent dignified retirement provided government ensures full non-bullsh-t job employment of kiwis \u0026mdash this can always be roughly ensured up definitions of what counts as bullsh*t job comment pension trust fund is great idea if you have finite money supply defend but under new zealands monetary system it is highly regressive do realize currently scrapping superannuation simply guaranteeing all pension payments is politically untenable but reading this you have wonder why even if pension payments would be guaranteed forever there is currently just too strong social psychological blockage understanding price story we begin one more axiom monopoly actions monopolist always has two options set price let quantity float or fix quantity they supply let price float most monopolists find it convenient for their customers use option fix price only later adjust price control quantity emitted as needed good example is electricity supply why would hydro-power station choose fix quantity of electrons they emit each day forcing customers bid for these electricity units itd be hyper-darwinian raw competition nightmare \u0026mdash only wealthy would get all electricity they need unless power station knew what demand it would be far more efficient socially equitable fix price of electric power allow supply vary by controlling dam gates this is what all our electric power utility companies do if they are at full dam release there is still more demand electric utility will raise price suppress demand currency-issuing government like nz is currency monopolist government can fix prices through wages it pays public sector employees \u0026mdash which establish wage standard for rest of economy through competition for hiring transfer payments made social welfare recipients pensioners \u0026mdash which is effectively adding non-government sector wage rate via addition aggregate demand collateral demanded for bank credit aka bank loans \u0026mdash this includes not only rbnz credit but also private bank credit since private banks permitted issue nzd credit have obtain their licence regulations from state this effectively fixes interest rate ceiling provided there is no commercial banking monopolist via competitive pressure on banks competing for customer debtors regulating reserve balances or irma through treasury bond operations fix interest rate floor new zealand practice is typically for nz government fix prices let quantity of nzd float state-currency is unique that \u0026lsquoown-price amount commodity trades for units of itself has meaningful consequence which is realized as bank interest rate spread government sets currency \u0026lsquoown price aka interest rate through central bank reserve policy by paying interest on bank reserves or by issuing treasury securities rbnz rates so determined by political decisions set corridors for all private bank credit lending rates it cannot be otherwise because private banks are competition for funds so cannot for long offer savers interest-income rate too much lower than rbnz rate cannot demand for long rate of interest repayment too much higher than rbnz ceiling rate because then competing banks will undercut them private markets offer goods for sale nzd because they need nz dollars pay their taxes amount of nz dollars available make purchases private market for goods priced nzd is determined by prices paid by government regulations on bank credit also determined by government nz dollars cannot come from anywhere else they either come from government spending at prices government sets or from bank credit which government regulates we do not get nzd from china before chinese consumers can get nzd buy goods from us or purchase nz treasury securities we must first supply them either nz bank credit or nz government spending no other agency has legal authority issue nz dollars therefore nz government only nz government can does determine general level for prices for all goods for sale nz dollars \u0026mdash whether government politicians know it or not nz government sets price level nz dollars thus sets inflation rate of nz dollar \u0026mdash again this is true whether government representatives know it or not if tomorrow nz government chose increase public sector wages social welfare benefits ten times current amounts general prices for all goods whole economy would next week or so adjust upwards by about ten times government chooses price level if government refuses pay higher prices there will be no inflation other than for certain single commodities through import prices which are not under our government’s control this may or may not be good policy depending upon circumstances such as import needs result of government refusing pay higher prices will be no contracts for non-government sector if higher prices are demanded so no government spending this collapses aggregate demand nzd if government is still issuing tax liabilities collecting on them then prices will rapidly lower until government is now willing spend again this is just monopoly pricing effect not good policy no government should want deflate currency this way because it only benefits wealthy all cases then government chooses price level thus chooses inflation rate inflation is policy variable not market determined quantity this does not mean inflation rate is easy policy variable manage it might be very good policy for government use fiscal policy through job guarantee wage benefit floor deliberately raise price level periodically perhaps every five years this is not technically inflation but has same effect it lowers purchasing power of hoarded wealth lowers burden on poor of their past debt since now their wage rate floor is higher than their past debt servicing rate recession particular designed controlled one-off inflation deliberate re-gauging of currency unit can be highly progressive egalitarian fiscal policy but it depends upon how currency is re-gauged if it is done by providing currency injections at base of economy then its egalitarian poorest should never be ones carrying burden of recession that not their fault economic boom when natural resources might be under threat of being depleted designed deliberate currency re-gauging policy might be desirable though either taxes or fines on goods for sale that are depleting natural resources or through rationing various other fiscal policies nz government is not beholden principle any private market forces for implementing any of these policies it is beholden principle only market for election votes aka democracy comment on 10 another way government can be seen be monopoly price setter would be through own price of currency otherwise known as interest rate if government sets very high interest rate high enough that debt servicing pretty much became operating cost for all economic sectors then interest rate would be inflation rate \u0026mdash this is by academic definition both would then become price for holding on cash *\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp*\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp* this completes basic outline of mmt however there are thousands of papers expanding on these basics full of subtlety nuance additional extra policy prescriptions that are not considered part of mmt proper but which can be considered as closely affiliated such as green energy transition economics social welfare economics trade economics poverty elimination housing economics anti-fragile banking like some of these topics will be addressed later questions caveats please just take careful note of postulates under system if any economy does not satisfy these conditions then it is not necessarily well described by proper mmt but mmt might still be useful few tweaks example would be when nation runs fixed exchange rate policy they can always choose move floating exchange rate but if they choose not then their fiscal policy space is severely reduced compared proper mmt economy almost all post-keynesian neoclassical new keynesian analysis implicitly adopts fixed exchange rate thinking so will not be correct according mmt if country runs floating exchange rate but will agree mmt policy constraints if country does run rigid fixed exchange rate or currency peg mmt analysis updates this case basically becoming post-keynesian framework post-keynesian analysis is thus roughly proper subset of mmt for example under fixed exchange rates government will have deficit constraint aka fiscal injection limit but what constraint is exactly will be impossible compute although it might be estimated some fair uncertainty because it depends upon microeconomics resource capacity point is that full resource capacity cannot be used when nation fixes their exchange rate they may be forced by their own needless self-imposed constraints tolerate involuntary unemployment while proper mmt system never has tolerate any unemployment there is no inflation constraint mmt system when floating exchange rate is adopted later questions will explain why there is however always real resource constraint \u0026mdash thats just physics mmt frameworks price paid for maintaining full employment can be exchange rate depreciation but this benefits exporters opposite benefits importers so exchange rate movements are internal domestic redistributions there is always sufficient flexibility open economy for such movements they determine who gets play more golf who gets go work factory government role is not intervene exchange rate but ensure there is no exchange rate speculation which serves no public purpose internal redistributions are fair equitable so that export oligarchs are not only ones getting knock off early for golf post-keynesians think there is inflation constraint they are wrong at least wrong case of new zealand they would be correct if fixed exchange rate applied but new zealand dropped fixed exchange rates 1985 since that date nz government has been operating no constraint on full employment yet disgustingly acting create unemployment nonetheless terrible policy mistake persisting for over 35 years \u0026mdash wiping out otherwise decent livelihood of entire generation now nearing two entire generations of kiwis for roughly same reason post-keynesians think large government debt is problem since debt servicing has be funded by raising taxes what they mean by funded is that there is need keep exchange rate fixed \u0026mdash so it is bad language framing this is of course incorrect proper mmt system government operating floating exchange rate has no debt constraint they have only real resource constraints mmt tells us that debt servicing for government sovereign is nothing but typing numbers into bank accounts of treasury bond holders there is no constraint here other than psychological or political governments can refuse type those numbers then bond holders are defrauded governments defaults why would government choose voluntarily default on such debt obligations there is no good reason other than either defend gold supply inapplicable today post breton-woods or ii defend desired exchange rate inapplicable nz since 1985 but otherwise post-keynesians are very close mmt all other respects on macroeconomics neoclassicals new keynesians have far more diverging views other than just obsessing on fixed exchange rates they for instance still have completely idiotic thinking about money supply marginal product of labour marginal cost of production champion of all bone-headed macroeconomic thinking \u0026mdash nairu total utter myth there is nairu only if governments refuse hire unemployed but most governments are prepared hire plenty of people who cannot find employment private sector so nairu is at best just artefact of stupid government policy governments who think or act as if private sector is supposed be responsible for full employment today australia new zealand japan usa are all examples of mmt systems this does not mean their politicians understand mmt typically they will not so bad policy choices that mmt would tell you are harmful workers can often result \u0026mdash this is no fault of mmt system that exists these countries it is fault of political misunderstandings power plays by oligarchs who desire see workers debt desperation for job means wage bargain can be undermined labour market is not fair game employers do not always forego income when worker is fired analogy would be like playing football system that is governed by rugby or even worse it could be usa lot like trying play nfl rules of baseball completely messed up government policy results for no good reason other than ignorance of monetary system under such political conditions one cannot blame mmt for any economic crises blame
