[{"content":"overview of projects asset exchange models these are pretty simple models class of econophysics they are agent-based models show basic wealth distributions that occur generically given some rules for how entities individuals or units like small firms exchange assets these models are great for thinking about fair distribution policies which at government regulatory level means fiscal policy models show that highly unfair wealth distributions naturally occur even when asset exchanges are uniform random this illustrates pareto dynamics or more colloquially rich get richer poor get poorer relative terms interest these models is that they show that even before accounting for political social power relations just raw asset exchange can ruin peoples lives through no fault of their own no fault of super rich existence of wealthy powerful people real world can only make things worse than these ideologically neutral asset exchange dynamics worse that is absent some sort of supernatural altruism charity from super rich when has human civilization ever witnessed such sociology they are not good models for real economic analysis which concerns production energy employment price stability minksy models these are ordinary differential equation ode models of realistic monetary economic systems they chunk economy into separate sectors use behavioural models model microeconomics of individuals firms because they are macroeconomic models chunked sectors they accurately account for sectoral balances hence provide brilliant analysis of economic class distribution but sacrificing microeconomics of firms details we use time series ode simulations which is proper way model economy as dynamical system there is thus no assumption of equilibrium markets we model money asset labour markets as roughly three homogenous types of market however for some analysis more sophistication is required for example three basic generalizations are two price models \u0026mdash financial assets stocks bonds forex trading non-owner occupied real estate are modern world only very loosely coupled pricing for real commodities water food electricity decent macroeconomic model should thus account for at least two general price levels third price is labour nominal wage rate but keen-goodwin models already have separate governing equations for wages four interest rate models \u0026mdash private banks offer spread on top of central bank rates so at minimum proper monetary model should use four interest parameters two for commercial bank rates governing credit money term deposits two for government bonds governing fiat currency operations capitalism models \u0026mdash these are models where private sector is split into three sectors banks firms household or if you prefer bankers capitalists workers this is proper way conduct modern marxist analysis of class struggle if you have enough computing power then of course defining further class structure can also be valuable for more nuanced class analysis we all know there is big difference between households who are credit their bank households who are debt if left alone laissez faire policy wealthy household will get wealthier indebted households will get poorer \u0026mdash through no fault of their own what about dsge note that we have absolutely no interest neoclassical new keynesian dsge models dynamic general stochastic equilibrium \u0026mdash because those are garbage gigo applies you cannot realistically model complex dynamical systems like whole economy using assumptions of equilibrium or pretending equilibrium attains just gets perturbed by some stochastic processes such thinking is retarded unnecessary historically reasons mathematical economics made assumptions of equilibrium supply demand because no one had computer power model non-equilibrium dynamics 1970s that all changed while physicists learned use non-linear dynamical system models classical economists did not for most part hence continued futile vain work on utterly bogus dsge models as evidence which our philosophy pages might discuss dsge models have no way predict debt-deflation crashes like 2008 gfc proper time evolution dynamical models by contrast can predict financial crashes or anticipate their onset any decent macroeconomic model must be capable of predicting such financial crashes this is why dsge has be completely rejected it is failed paradigm we know why it fails so why do mainstream economists central bankers still use them this is bit of mystery because theyre not stupid people answer for resolving this mystery is sociological ideological system dynamics models minksy models are class of non-linear dynamical system or system dynamics sd models they can exhibit chaotic dynamics or what is known popular cultures as butterfly effect why macro matters these sd models are what policy people should study because microeconomics of firms households are decoupled from large scale macroeconomics due failures of composition failure of composition means whole is more than sum of its parts reason microeconomics agents do not compose or scale up macroeconomics is due several critical factors most national single legislature economies use single currency at least outside eurozone those single currency regions are regulated by currency monopolist otherwise known as government existence of currency legislative monopoly which are same institution means endogenous money analysis fails so microeconomics cannot be scaled up macro place government scare quotes above because this phrase is prone being misunderstood government means entire government system which for monetary economy means legislature parliament executive ministries prime ministers presidents treasury central bank no matter who owns central bank furniture it is still branch of consolidated government it is required by law every country on earth today do bidding of parliament cooperate daily treasury treasury make instructions for all payments authorized by parliament central bank runs banking payments clearing system which makes those payments all commercial bank reserves are spreadsheets owned by central bank days before computers they ledger books as any agency of government parliaments may grant their agents some autonomy independence but this is not granted freely mythical independence of central bankers is precisely that myth if parliament desires zero interest rate bound then it can always instruct its central bank make it so this is true even for uk usa where central bank independence is supposedly sacred mantra it is null mantra how do we know so government cheques never bounce if central bank refuses issue payments on behalf of parliament desiring provision public service those central bankers will soon be fired but of course we do not know this for fact because central banks have never refused make payments${}^\\ast$ they always can because they are monopoly issuers of states currency unit \u0026mdash they cannot run out of money they issue it by fiat ${}^\\ast$ there that time russian central bank turned off their lights that default however as soon as they realized they issued rouble by keystroke lights came back on so this can be filed under exception proves rule argentina mexican debt defaults foreign currencies not their own currency so not same thing either mmt short lesson no government needs borrow foreign currency not ever they might borrow order manipulate their exchange rate but all that does is change domestic distribution who gets mow lawns who gets play golf summary simpler way say all that is that existence of single currency monopoly power means single currency region is inherently macroeconomic macro dictates micro several ways so it is inherently top-down system some elements of bottom-up if there is semblance of democracy for more of this sort of theory of micro
